9,"So I'm trying to logically think what's going on. Back in mid-2016, GoPro stock was tanking because of long period of no new products and falling ER. Then in August, when a new GoPro Hero 5 rumor started popping out, the stock went to $13~14. Then in Semptember, when the new hero 5 and Karma were announced, the stock jumped to ~$17, but then settled back down to $14.Now we have new Hero 5 camera and Karma. Yes, Karma was recalled, but even before Karma release was clear, the stock was around $13~14. So, shouldn't the stock price be at around $13~14 now? Why is it below $10, especially when Hero 5 sale is pretty well? Does it mean this stock has lots of emotional investors? Seriously, the company looks a lot better than back in mid-2016, but the stock price is not higher.",0.9924

13,"If you see opportunity for stock price appreciation because the company will be acquired at a premium then stay. Does anyone doubt their exceptional technology? Drones, self-driving cars, all critically require this stuff. Cameras are critical but nowadays seen as either value-add (like iPhone) or necessary to apply a firms niche market solutions such as with agricultural drones. Companies are buying secondary technologies, either using the production channel or via acquisition instead of investing resources and capital to build themselves. The Retail opportunity for GPRO is dying. If they can change their business model to one of channels sales or OEM they’ll be fine. Think outside of the box, people!!

30,"So I see all the class acts still remain here. To those holding the stock, congratulations on the 16% rise. I sold this and am currently long another stock.For those who do believe in charting, today was very significant. All signs prior to today showed oversold and today provided the first of 2 candlesticks. There is speculation here regarding institutional buying -- not necessarily. Average volume is about 4M shares. The public can easily spin 20% of the float -- and realize that for every share bought, another was sold. This could have provided an exit point as much as a good day up. The 2nd candlestick will be instrumental meaning you should look for continued volume (not like today, but higher than average) along with trending up. If the stock settles back to the mid 7s, that wouldn't be a good sign. Mid 8s is another plateau -- really moving into the 10s would be where you want to be next.I'd like to point out that this is being spun as another 270 jobs -- I'm not sure if that makes a total workforce cut of 17% or if this is additive for total cuts of over 30%. All I will say is either the company had a lot of people not doing much or this is reactionary. If the later, production and many other things will suffer. Any workforce losing 3/10 people can't continue at the same pace unless you're removing dead weight along with entire sectors of business. Also -- you eventually need to improve your business model -- you can't just keep cutting staff.With market reaction to SNAP, I don't believe GPRO is out of the woods yet. Even though the next call isn't until May, Woodman should have a good sense of numbers now given the quarter is wrapping up in 2 weeks. Hopefully the guidance provided is accurate.Good luck to those holding. If I am able to exit my other positions and GPRO is back in the 7s, I might jump back in for the ride through earnings -- but probably would not hold through the announcement given their history.",0.9953

52,"So, let me get this straight. Last year, GoPro had .22 EPS for Q4. This year, it’s more than 3x that. And they’re worried that the company “missed estimates.” Seriously?! They set it ridiculously high. Even the massive FAANG companies miss their own forecasts all the time. I honestly do not understand why people still pay attention to these analysts and their forecasts. I’ve done very well over the years by just ignoring their stupidity. You can’t set some ridiculous standards and then act all surprised if the company doesn’t meet it. Hell, even .66 EPS is reasonable, and that’s 200% higher than last year’s! No, the dimwits chose .70+ EPS. My mind is seriously blown. Let’s call these forecasts what they really are—mostly guesses. That’s how Tesla even beat the Q3 earnings estimate by over 900%! Do you people still believe these analyst clowns? You’re going to miss out on good companies or miss out on fundamental-driven stock rises. Just pay attention to the actual meaningful numbers and not “forecasts.”",0.8818

Going up on low volume to me isn't really significant, but I'll take the gains regardless. Volume has been below average. Building strength here. I made mention of this prior... selling in the last ER was about 30% the time before and the news wasn't that bad. Also, legal announcements should start up again within a couple weeks. All the various lawsuits will ""consolidate"" into one . Might mean a bit of money for all those holding pre-last earnings announcement.

Number one means it doesn't get any better than this. I do not know what that translates in revenue, however number one means your products are in demand. It means the market has the highest regards for your products, and it also means that you could barely keep product on the shelves.This is something I have suspected all along. It's one thing to have production issues, and it's another if you can't sell you products because no one wants them (AKA BlackBerry). In the case of GPRO, it was a production issue and not a demand issue.In fact I think the company's guidance last quarter was very conservative. Granted GPRO's next quarter will be without much (if any) Karma revenue, but people forget that this is a camera company, and not a drone company (yet).So while the Karma recall was a disappointment, the fact that camera sales are 33% up Y/Y, more than makes up for any lost Karma sales.",0.9832

Come on look at GoPros revenue and margin decline and tell me how you could possibly be that optimistic. Management failed in the direction of the company.

(NASDAQ: GPRO) ushered in a new era of creativity with the announcement of its 360-degree camera, Fusion, which begins shipping to US and European customers today. With its ability to capture immersive 5.2K 360-degree spherical content, Fusion captures everything around you, so you’ll never miss the shot. And gimbal-like stabilization makes sure it all looks super smooth. The GoPro app enables users to control the camera, live preview their shots, and stitch, trim and share content right from their iOS smartphone (Android coming soon). On desktop, Fusion Studio (with Adobe Premiere Pro CC plug-ins) enables OverCapture, which lets you re-frame and save traditional fixed perspective videos “punched out” from the large 360-degree video. Fusion, together with its apps, enables people to capture and share unique perspectives that are not possible with traditional single lens cameras. Bring everyone in the moment with you. Shoot in all directions in stunning 5.2K""A mobile OverCapture experience and new visual presets including Tiny Planet and PanoFlow will be released in early 2018, while ongoing software updates will continue to enhance the experience for users.Fusion is already receiving praise for its outstanding design and engineering, earning a CES 2018 Innovation Award in the digital imaging category.",0.9968

395,"A goodbye letter to Craig, jbrad043, mark, Dan K, and Olivia Jagger:I did love the back and forth posts about GPRO but I have since moved on to Cryptocurrencies. What caught my attention was new about Bitcoin trading at $4,000 when I last heard about it was trading at $200 a couple of years ago. I watched alt coins like OMG jump 6900% and knew there was a different way to make money. For the last couple of months, I have open crypto wallets, accounts on exchanges around the world, and just put in an order to buy some mining machines out of Russian. I have participated in ICOs like 0x which I closed my position at a 800% profit, just close out KNC ICO at 300%, and sold NEO coins after a 40% jump.The cryptoworld now is just getting started and it's like internet in 1997 which only had AOL email. This is a huge shift. People no longer need banks to transfer money, it can be all done via cryptocurrencies for pennies, taking seconds, to anywhere in the world. Smart contracts will eliminate companies like Uber and Airbnb since it will eliminate the middleman and create a true peer to peer network. Even Etrade and Ameritrade will not be needed as people shift to decentralized exchanges.You obviously are very smart and very dedicated but I think you commit a huge about of time, chasing pennies with GPRO when you could be chasing hundreds or thousands of dollars in getting into cryptocurrencies.This video is a great interview with an ex-hedge fund manager, formerly of the investment firm Fortress Investment Group talking about cryptocurrencies.

""Although GoPro has lost almost 94% of its overall value since reaching its all-time high in 2014, it will continue experiencing more problems in the years ahead. Not only GoPro faces tough competition from other players in the industry, but it is also hampered by consistent lack of proper business management, increasing expansion as well as Research and Development (R&D) expenses, and decreasing brand popularity.All the recent news including GoPro's decision to layoff workers, substantial price discounting, as well as missing analyst's targets throws light on a fact that the action-camera maker is rapidly losing its significance in the market.The stock currently trades at its all-time low, and it will likely continue moving downward in the forthcoming years.

Basically, there will be no Karma 2, but Karma 1 is still on the shelf. It was disappointing to hear that Gopro exited from the drone market, but it might a good move for Gopro. After all, the Karma division has under-achieved by delaying the initial release, had a recall for its debut, and have not followed up with a Karma 2 after one year of Karma 1's release. Cutting off an under-achieving department is a difficult decision to make, but sometimes a business has to make such decision to focus on its core profitable business for the short term. While it continues to sell the current Karma 1, it will provide revenue, and even some profit, from the Karma sales (though the bad publicity will negatively impact sales), because the Karma dept has been trimmed of excessive cost.",0.8147

There are a number of large-scale commercial applications for these cameras. I don't believe the drone market will be their savior in any way, shape or form. Also, I noticed some hostile responses to your initial email. It certainly isn't a requirement to own the stock to have an opinion if it is sound -- and yes, the market has punished this stock, rightfully so. Mark -- I'm a bit surprised at your comments both to Olivia and Jason. While I don't have any use for Craig most of the time, it seems you might be pumping the stock -- and I own it. Factually speaking we know the stock gained about 11% yesterday and held on to 8%. We also see today that while it gave a little back, it seems to be holding above 10 with decent volume. We also know that there has been a decrease in shorts by 5% since last week - but this is with a stock that had 32% short to start and that's HUGE. It seems the Hero 5 sold well. But, as Olivia stated, Woodman has been HORRIBLE to date in his delivery. Aside from historical numbers and 2016, which we all need to know about, they need a solid plan for 2017 that will help this stock North and restore faith in this company.Really holding anything near 10 today will be a win as far as I'm concerned.

With a forward PE of 7-11 this is a steal for anyone who is wanting to hold this for 12 m or more. But even for the next 6 months I believe we'll see steady climb from $9 to $15, but believe we'll hit $20 before the end of the year.When asked what the plan was for leveraging the cash flow, the CFO I believe said they rolled some of it into debt retirement and planning for some that are due in 2025. This is building investor value.Summary - we're not going to see a short squeeze.... and No Reddit pumped craziness. BUT I now believe we'll see $20 before 12/31/2021.

713,"I just spent the last few hours watching the Intro Event, and listening to the conference call. My initial reaction was that GoPro just hit one out of the park. Pricing is right where it should be and this will definitely be on the top of everyone's Christmas list.After listening to the conference I was somewhat disappointed when it was revealed that Karma does not have a ""follow me"" capability. I should think that the next iteration of Karma will probably incorporate a follow me feature. That said I went to the GoPro web site and watched all of the videos about the drone itself, the stabilization mount, and the controller itself. What I discovered, is Karma was designed to be the most user friendly drone available so that even a person who has no drone piloting experience will be able to master the use of this incredible camera platform easily and confidently. There is even a flight simulator built into the controller so that you can practice using the controller and view a Karma drone in simulated flight on the controller screen without ever having the actual drone take off. There are several pre-programmed flight paths that can be used to do some common video paths. One is a 360 degree circle path around the subject, another is a from point A to point B flight path and another is a path that pans from the ground below to the horizon while the drone flies forward.The fact that the stabilization system can be removed from the Karma drone, and turned into a hand held stabilization device is a huge plus which enables hand held Hero 5 cameras to be turned into an autonomous GoPro camera stabilization platform.You can get spare batteries, motor arms, propellers etc as reasonably priced accessories too.I have to say that one of the things that GoPro does that I find is heads and shoulders above any other company out there, is that GoPro has the capability to produce the most stunning promotional marketing videos that can knock you socks off. GoPro's promotion videos make you want to go out and buy their latest and greatest gadgets. It is my guess that when the holiday season gets here you are going to see GoPro promotional videos targeting the Christmas shoppers and the new Hero5 Black and Karma drone packages are going to be selling like hotcakes at the $1099 price point. And for those who already have a Hero4, the $799 Karma package will sell well too.With these new product offerings, I think GoPro is back on track to be the leader in this field, and I predict a very bright future if they stay on this course.GLTAL",0.9982

He’s an expert in Merger and Acquisitions as well; No background here, just believe that because he says that no company has every announced interest in acquiring GoPro means that noone is interested; if you disagree he will fight you (Hes probably also a MMA champion / title holder during his 20 year tenure at Maker Studio)3. His qualitative assessment on why people should just use their phones to film action shots is the gold standard. The reason is the cloud and that some smart phones are cheaper than GoPros ( Dont worry about video quality or protection from the elements or actions, everybody loves cracked screens)4.

DJI responded by firing a number of employees, alerting law enforcement, and also set up new internal channels for employees to submit confidential and anonymous reports relating to any violations of the company’s workplace conduct policies.DJI added in a statement that it not incur a full year loss in 2018.DJI discovered the employee fraud corruption via an internal probe and has fired at least some of the workers involved. According to Reuters, news of the massive embezzlement began on Friday when an internal document regarding the incident was shared on Chinese social media.DJI did not disclose how many employees were involved, but the Financial Times reported it could be as high as 29 employees.“DJI holds our employees to strict ethical standards and takes any violation of our code of conduct very seriously,” DJI said in a prepared statement. “DJI took swift action to address this issue, dismissed a number of employees who violated company policies, and contacted law enforcement officials. We continue to investigate the situation and are cooperating fully with law enforcement’s investigation.”DJI is far and away the world’s largest drone maker, making popular drones including the DJI Mavic Air, DJI Phantom and DJI Mavic Pro. The company employees about 14,000 people globally. The DJI market share is now at an estimated 74%, up from 72% in 2017, according to the 2018 Drone Market Sector Report by Skylogic Research.DJI is a privately held company and thus does not disclose its financials, but in 2018 was said to have a $15 billion valuation in light of discussions around a new round of funding that would have raised between $500 million and $1 billion. That would mark the biggest round ever raised by DJI, whose previous $75 million fundraising from Accel Partners in 2015 valued it at $10 billion.Share this:",0.1666

912,5 Reasons GPRO is going back to $81. Most Importan -Membership program; 80% of the members got the service included for 1 year w the purchase of a device. It was actually cheaper to get the camara w the membership than w/o. This means no revenue has been collected & doubt most will actually pay for it when their trial is over. 2. 30X PE nothing else to say about this crazy valuation 3. Small Caps rallied hard and juice is about to run out (Rus 2K)4. GOPRO went public in 1993 and in all these years they still aren’t profitable. WHAT??? 5. The so called CEO just last week sold 200K shares or $2.5MM. Never a good sign when the captain of the boat sheds a significant percentage of his shares specially just a couple of week away from reporting earnings.

So i purchased the H4B, and still there are additional opportunities for more angles that look great, now i have the H5B, so now when i go snowboarding, i have one on my helmit, one on the front of the board facing up at me, and one on my gopro stick in my hand catching a wider view of me and a group of friends. All different shots to make for a great video project. The karma gives an additional angle to add in, diversifying my video like I diversify my stocks. The truth is H4B is still a competitive camera today, two years later, in terms of overall quality, durability and specs.

1156,Recently Apple announced iPhone 11 and tried to sell it based on its camera features rather than any other feature . What’s the take away. More competition for GoPro but at the same time Apple has an assessment of this growing market and they want a piece of this market just like they wanted in car. Now we have to ask ourselves what can GOPro do to defend itself ? Well when some one attack your fortress you don’t wait for the past hour to defend . GoPro management must realize this new threat and leap into apples own fortress as I suggested earlier last year to start producing cellular cameras to integrate the whole community into its ecosystem. Not easy but no worth it . It must start thinking like a diversified company rather than just media company . You can leap into other industries if you have the right approach but I know investors will doubt once again if they try. I m still bullish on GoPro as I didn’t see any significant change and a lot of GoPro videos now surfacing on you tube meaning they are on the verge of monetizing content very soon.

At this point it could drop all the way to $0, which it likely is going to, and it will not even make a blip on my overall portfolio.

Once Karma releases and people have still not gotten their Mavic, we might see some conversions. Also Karma will be in stores before the Mavic will so that could help as well.",0.9302

This demand should transfer to Q1 2018 after all the reviews are out on youtube and the rest of the film making population understand what this camera can do.

1277,"I've learned a valuable lesson today... come to this board without signing in so I can see everything posted by Craig and JustMoi given I have them both on ignore... chuckle a bit... then give my 2 cents. After all, I do need some entertainment.First, to address all the negative comments. Craig has actually made a few good points. 2017 is a very instrumental year for GPRO in terms of cash. However, given the 15% cut in workforce and removal of dead businesses causing them to return to core businesses -- combined with the news today... well seems we are headed in the right direction. To what Mark said, year over year, revenues continue to climb. This is meaningless if expenses grow faster than revenues -- so now they need to manage growth and continue to develop new innovative products to keep the markets humming.A few asked how JustMoi came up with 4.74 -- He did pick something near half... but did no math. Given the keystrokes are near one another, it makes for an easy lie. Normally I wouldn't be so rude -- but JustMoi... provide some basis or seriously shut the f up. A chart, graph or anything that supports anything coming out of your fingers. Even if you're shorting, you can't be drinking your own Koolaid. I think all of us here, even those holding the stock are open to real information of which you are providing ZERO. But for those who may be new or impressionable, I always urge you to listen to none of us and look at the facts.Now on to technicals... About 6.5M shares by 8:20am PST. We are looking at a 10M+ day. A week or two ago I mentioned candlesticks... well here you go. As Mark stated, holding above 10 today would be a great sign and as he also stated, some of this is institutional trading. I found his comment to Craig a bit funny about Level 2. I'm guessing he is googling it right now to figure out what that even means. There will probably be some piggyback news in the next day or two to keep the run going.Honestly today the news was not that substantial -- in my opinion. However, it is moving the market significantly and as I've stated prior, this will cause an overreaction with a short squeeze. My word of caution is beware of the 2nd candlestick, especially if it is down. As always, take 30 minutes and study the annual chart as well as the 3 and 6 month charts. History has a way of repeating itself.I think we might see a small bump or even on 2/2 -- I don't see us revisiting the low 9s anytime soon. I know... facts. Well, sales, even without the Karma, were much better than expected and are suggesting year over year growth of 30%. This will be tempered by write downs, which is why I don't think it will bump as much as it otherwise would. However they are decreasing operating expenses moving forward. Unfortunately that won't be reflected until Q1 2017. Above everything else, they need to provide an executable and attainable plan. Under commit and over perform.Good luck to all those holding.",0.9986

GoPro is a great brand with great distribution (you see it really everywhere, go to Asia it is at every mall, airport, etc.). Read the book: how brands grow, key to growth is brand and distribution. GoPro will be taken over sooner than later and mark my words it will not be one of the Top A players (Apple, Amazon etc - no relevance to existing business) also not of the B Players (Sony, Garmin) - they don't have the marketing talent or stomach for it, they wouldn't know what to with such a youngster brand. I mean when was the last thing you saw something great from Sony after PlayStation or Garmin… cant even recall?

Audio was set to auto and cut half my voice off until i switched to stereo setting. anything beyond iso 800 is not usable. only can do 4k with the fisheye fov. low light is terrible. color and stabilization only works well in really good light. maybe i was expecting too much from this little thing. but going by the number or returns people report. this seems not to be just my issue. so far it seems like gopro is just giving anyone who complains a new unit. maybe there was a manufacturing issue with earlier units. yes i have manually updated firmware!,0.9804

1489,"I see Karma differently. To me it stands on its own, and let me tell you my thought process.....As a kid, I had a chance to get a action figure (Batman) vs. a transformer (Optimus prime), if I were to compare them, is that a fair comparison? Now, I absolutely loved Batman, had shirts, sheets, etc..., but, I chose a transformer, but why? It did something that the Batman action figure couldn't do, which is act as an action figure, but then transform into something else (a semi truck). Which meant, I could not only play with it as a robot, but then play with it as a truck, getting multiple uses as a kid out of it. Now, I take a look at the Karma, is there any other drone that I can get multiple uses from? Those uses being removing the durable camera and using it in air, water, land; then also being able to use it with a gimbal for professional like quality footage, as well as being attached to a drone for aerial footage. Now, is this a good comparison, I think so, is it a perfect comparison, probably not, but, there was a transformer that came along called Soundwave, in which, it could transform into a cassette player (not a real one), but also had a tape inside that came out and could also transform into a robot animal and played with on its own, which became one of my favorites. That said, is it fair to compare a transformer with a single use action figure??Karma is similar in that it has uses that I don't believe others have yet, and in my eyes, it is the transformer of the drone market, so is it fair to compare to other single use drones?? I believe it stands alone, and will attract consumers just because it has multiple uses. Or, maybe I am the only consumer who sees multi uses as a better option. But if I get another drone, which doesn't have a detachable camera, or a durable one, I also have to purchase a handheld gimbal and a durable, good quality camera; different brands potentially, research for best price vs. quality; price tag of approximately $400 extra if choosing knockoffs, more if preferring long lasting quality/durability. I was extremely disappointed in the recall, if it wasn't for that, we would be in a lot better shape. However, the potential is there because of multi use aspect that no one else has, all one brand, one stop shop, which makes up for some of the lack of capabilities of Karma. Am I way off the mark here??? Feedback/criticism welcomed.",0.9989

1501,"This is definitely a BUY opportunity. Let me explain why. GoPro underpromises. They are no longer that company builds a huge inventory, ends up with overstock and announces loss the following quarters. They want to be profitable , which requires them to be a little on the conservative end with inventory levels. Btw, they become profitable as we know. Cash flow is important. All the difference for 17 Q4 guidance is 50M (520-470). Now, GoPro beat estimations by approx. 20M in 17 Q3. And there is no question that the Q4 revenue will be higher than Q3. In a quarter where you have more sales, you have better chance to make up that 50M. I strongly believe they are underpromising.

1571,"Disclaimer: As I said before I do not plan to sell my shares until it reaches $14.Let's do the math: 1. Company has roughly $145M cash, which translates to $1 per share. It has long term debt of $80M, so in general 40 cents per share.2. It is already profitable, with closing this calendar year with on expected value of 4 cents per share. This is including the one time cost of restructuring with cost more than 45 cents per share and another 9 cents loss on Q2 which will be negated. All in all even without growth it is very reasonable to expect it finish 2018 with over $1.3B sales and 60 cents earnings. Add in your own growth projections.3. With an industry average P/E of 25 this already puts the stock to $15 per share + 40 cents net positive cash, so easily $15.40. This is from today's numbers with projections, with any kind of growth on sales it can even go higher.So, yeah I do not care if it is $9 today, $8 next week, $7.5 1 month later. If the market does not appreciate it now, it will 8-12 months down the road. I am patient, and I will wait for a breakthrough (if not somebody acquiring it earlier).",0.9931

1631,"Good morning. Quick update. A couple days back both slow and fast stochistics crossed (%k, %d) signifying a change in direction (up). Also moving averages (10 and 50) crossed. RSI stable around 55-60. We had a bump in volume late yesterday in trading as well as one this morning for a total of about 750K shares between the 2 days. Would like to see 9s this week with volume moving towards 2M+ shares daily. Easily expecting $9.25 exit point (for me) before Thursday, but not set on if I will remove the sell and wait until Thursday day or sell prior. Earnings release s/b after hours. I would expect us in an oversold condition prior to earnings looking at 1 month or longer charts. That said, I think buying right now would be risky as we don't see the 9s frequently.Fundamentally speaking, the new COO seems to be on the right path to internal cleanup. Also I am a fan of the buyback program for a number of reasons as I've mentioned in prior posts. From a consumer perspective, it helps create more brand loyalty as they release new cameras. From a back office perspective, they can gauge the number of conversions from old to new in an effort to scale production accordingly before new product releases to avoid shortages or extreme overproduction. I also believe this can allow for a small bump in price-point as consumers will know they can upgrade at a discount going forward. Lastly, with the $175M lending, even though almost 80M of that was used for a private stock buyback, I think this provides some reassurance that this stock is worth at least 10s and more if and when they right the ship. Lenders would have been privy to forecasting models and estimates that none of us have seen as part of their diligence. For those interested who actually understand the benefits of charting and are frequent traders, I""m happy to share other stocks with buy and sell points. As I've always said, here to make money.

They will also want to open a platform for the customers in the future where they can post videos just to share with the world .

Yes this is true. So you’re 50/50 so far. Now looking at the last three quarters isn't enough to completely analyze GoPro's financial statements which is what you did. You must look at 2013, 2014 and 2015. This is where many don't want to take the time to look onto. Revenue is climbing every year from 2013-2015. 2013 was 985.737 million 2014 was 1.3942 billion 2015 was 1.6919 billion. Do you see a trend here? Now your argument will be what about 2016? Well we only have info for three quarters and fourth quarter historically is the best for GOPro. So am I saying everything is rosy? No not even close. Given they have had 6 bad quarters where over spending and diving into areas maybe they shouldn't. I personally feel GOpro was trying to expand too much too fast. Learn to walk before you run so to say. A company with a market cap of 1.3 billion and 1.6 billion in yearly sales (revenue) does not have a sales problem but a spending problem, period.

With 2 billion in revenue and net profit of 10% it would be able to make 200 million a year and with 15% 300 million. With 3 billion of revenue they would be able to make 300 million a year at 10% profit and 450 million with 15% net profit. All that being said GoPro is at huge discount and the least optimistic estimate would be 150 million a year. That is the sole reason institutions are on a buying spree.

It’s based upon $1.3b revenue @ 37% net gross margin generating $481m in gross profit. Remember GOPRO operating expense will decline from $300m in 2020 to $250m in 2021. Thus, $481m-$250m generates $231m net profit. That reduction of $50m in operating expenses will cost near $32m in severance and cancelled lease contracts. What’s remaking is $231m net profit-$32m in severance and property reduction leaves $200m in profit. With an estimated 170m shares that generates $1.18 earnings per share. With a PE of 12 ($1.18 x 12x earnings). Therefore, the stock will be somewhere near $14. The massive OPEX reduction unlocks shareholder value. To support my analysis, if FY OPEX was $400m or $150m higher than forecasted $250m in FY 2021, which make GOPRO marginally profitable. The power of cost reduction and operational excellence always generates great results.",0.9797

2113,"(Quick conclusion for people who do now enjoy reading: It's time to change tech-stock if you are looking for the big bucks)Hi there,First time typing on this board, have me excused if I do not know the rules. Yesterday I sold this stock at 14.67, only to regret it, since it rose another 3.5%. But today I certainly do not regret that choice. I've been following the stock for some time now as a long, and I have doubled my savings doing so.. But this will be it for now. The stock has exploded in the last couple of months, and right now the Zen-hype has finally reached the last investors resulting in yesterday's spike. The threat that AMD poses to Intel has however also become aware to them, and I am sure that the savings on their products just is one of many financially tactical decisions that Intel will make use of.. Even though I'm not a fan of Intel, I most certainly am a realist, and to think that AMD suddenly will steal an incredible market share from such a financially stable competitor is just naive. Even though the stock may continue rising a couple of percent this year, I am certain that it's rapid growth is over. 700% in a year is almost to good to be true.The decision to sell my stock, however, was really hard, since I did not know where to put this money that I had made of this share. I ended up at GoPro ($GPRO) because the similar position it has in the market to AMD's position 52 weeks ago. A large brand with lack of innovation. Their stock has been receding to just 16% of it's value 2 years ago, and I believe that the tables have finally turned for them. With the now large competition in the action-camera market, they've chosen to focus on drones, which in the following years will be HUGE, since governments all around the world are investing in those. And looking for a large-scale drone purchase of a government, these government will take large note of GoPro since it is a brand known for quality and efficiency. That's it. Again, I'm not here to convince people to leave AMD behind, and I do believe that the company has a couple of pennies left for the year.. But if you (as I am) are looking for companies with big potential, then it might be time to change. And my best guess is the GoPro-stock.",0.9978

Because those who understand that GoPro cannot be trusted just yet did some smart profit taking if they had bought under $9 and now, with manipulation, the market is correcting a bit. There is no reason to think that Q4 will be beating any estimates and Q1 will be in the red too. Karma will not have new features, most likely, and the holiday season where they thought they would sell it is long gone. Plus, Karma is already behind in terms of some basic technology that drone users want. But hey, if some of you want to ignore the facts, it's ok. That is what makes America great. There is a sucker born every minute and someone else knows how to separate them from their money. Would you stay with a spouse who lies and disappoints as consistently as Woodman and GoPro?

2251,Gopro is a prime candidate for acquisition. Their technology is far superior to others within that space. Sophisticated drones designed for markets like agriculture or search and rescue MUST have reliable and flexible cameras. They need to be capable of withstanding severe weather and patented stabilization within the camera itself. Companies in need of this technology will “lock-in” supply chains similar to how Apple does it. Ironically another great example is how GoPro used Ambarella chips.

2307,"what should worry you most is that revenue was down over 220M in Q4 and then still down 10M in Q1. If gopro demand was still strong they wouldnt miss that big in q4. They also should have seen added q1 revenue from customers that were maybe waiting for the typical price drop, but they didnt. They blamed drone sales in q1 but they also gained suscription revenue (typical gpro management deflection) so it's worrisome to say the least. GoPro has ambitious suscriber growth forecast for the year and honestly in surprised how many they have this far too. All companies are shifting to suscriber revenue streams to balance their revenue. I would wait for another ER of bad sales. Then you may get an entry price that matches the risk involved in this stock. Still too many gopro hopefuls laying around propping up the price. This company will only succeed through future products if they connect directly to social media or streaming. Why anyone would own this stock before GoPro releases such a product isn't fair to themselves. The products gopro currently sells are in a shrinking market, as well as declining Average Selling Prices. If you expect a turnaround with this current camera line up I would highly suggest asking yourself if there might be another option other than gopro for the time being.",0.989
2308,"Woodman stresses 'partnerships' and seems to say 'standalone' did not work out.He says more business model optimization/growth just in camera... Hmm...Looks like some partner asked Gopro to prove it can be focussed on camera and software, subscriptions as the business model and show margins. There might be a promising product that may be in the cards to interest that partner...His facial expression seems to indicate some truth to it and his leaning towards partner shows some confidence...(sorry that's my read and btw I am not a fan of how woodman managed it so far).130k subscribers without pitching subscription it seems... I would not be surprised if the content channel comes back on. Either he is clueless or is re-inventing for a better model: we will see in the next 3 months. Given all this, there may be less downside risk than upside potential at this point.Btw, this stock is highly manipulated. Two observations based on past data:1. In most cases, shorts attack when mkt goes up (safest short given its low volume); when mkt goes down, there are usually better ROI candidates to short than this... There is enough confidence/support for this pattern, look back in history. All of it is predicated on 'low' volume days.2. There is a second pattern on breaking-support levels (7.5, 6.12, then 5.7). I was surprised that Gopro was unshaken with mkt drops last week but now it may be the only one that dropped/stayed so (while mkt recovered so well). Seems to be a trading stock (although so far trend has been down but might reverse soon given there is some strategic less-risky shift into software and subscription).",0.956

A cell phone camera is great but it doesn't serve the same market or function. GoPro owns this market and is dominating it. There is profit in producing independent film, youtube is a billion dollar entity because of such filmographers, and GoPro is their tool of choice by in large. This will not change. Not only do I own and use GoPros I will continue to do so. I will aslo continue to by their products as will my friends amd colleagues who all also use GoPros exclusively.I don't believe the PPS should be 80.00 as it once was, but it certainly should be above 10.00.

2714,"I swear this is a hub for misinformation. As of late...- Average volume is at 3.8M shares (10-day moving average)- Price has moved from high 8s to mid 9s. No real resistance at these levels- No volume spikes other than the 1 selloff after Q4 ER.- No news regarding any buyouts, rumors or otherwise- No new guidance regarding 11s or 12s- There is no ""short squeeze"" currently. Nasdaq shows short interest down 2M shares from mid to late January. However we won't know more until mid/late February numbers are posted.My OPINION -- based on charts and historical movement, I don't think we will see 10s without news. I would prefer to see less news and more execution. Given the Karma just re-entered the marketplace and the HERO 5 line is relatively new, I wouldn't expect new products until late 2017. ALL SPECULATION. If blingx2 is correct, this could suggest that either the Karma is very popular OR channels have short supply. Until we see numbers or indicators -- WE WON'T KNOW.As for all the babble about charting not working -- that simply means you don't know how to chart. For those of you that believe in the company you own shares -- great! I am all about numbers... plain and simple. And if you believe that investing is simply luck, then I'd advise you to put your money in the bank. This isn't Vegas. For those of us who actually do understand charting -- no major indicators. But the 10/50 DMA are converging suggesting a change in direction away from consolidation. Yet I do believe it will require news for a significant upward swing.So for all the jbrads, marks, orena and all the rest -- gotta say, I just don't understand. 90%+ of your ""information"" and I use that term loosely, is just made up garbage. I don't need to call you names, tiny, troll or anything else. But I will admit, I simply don't get it. Are we going to see 11s and 12s? Maybe -- but again, need some actual real news that people can get behind. If this were truly a buyout target, I believe interest would have already been sparked. But I do believe this company could merge with others in media for a good additive arrangement.To those holding, good luck.

Another Hero camera won't change the increasing lower priced competition not only from other camera makers but from cell phones as well. Woodman turned down a partnership with DJI and now GPRO has their own mediocre drone to sell to the shrinking GPRO faithful. Woodman's only answer to GPRO's problems is et another Hero camera.

2882,"Stuck at a higher entry point, I don't always enjoy Craig's posts. However, as an online analyst (on this board), he has raised some valid points by looking at the stock and the company in black and white and not grey. For what it's worth, looking at international potential, I believe GPRO will continue to make inroads. That's a plus. From a consumer standpoint, while slipping, GoPro continues to have the credibility investors no longer see. As a camera company, the drone may not have been a good idea. Woodman is a minor league player, now in the big leagues, and not smart enough to see he's his own worst enemy. Read glassdoor.com and learn the common thread among posts is the poor internal management that governs. Many on this board post conjecture; their statements belie the truth. They're fortunate DJI is having their own drone issues. And the fact is, there may be room in this world for both DJI and GoPro in the drone world. I'm heartened that today's action was on low volume. Does it surprise anyone there is no clarity on what is happening at GoPro right now? Do you ever wonder if the flight problem was a GoPro issue or the fault of a supplier? There are other questions which need answers. And this is where I agree with Craig: If there are no positive facts coming from the company and no explanation as to steps taken toward a brighter future, why buy the stock?",0.9806

Is the gopro a good camera choice to take pictures of your family and pets, no. If your backpacking in the mountains, kayaking, surfing, wakeboarding, or skiing every weekend than yes a gopro is the camera for you.After the Q3 surprise earning beat I really thought gopro would meet the top end of their Q4 estimate. Wasn't expecteding guidance to drop as much as it did, bummer for investors. GoPro still has crazy sex appeal and content, brand in my mind is worth more than fitbit. Things could turn around, they could very well have a profitable 2018 through focusing on their primary customer and cutting unprofitable ventures.

I bet that is just an excuse as they know they will not be in demand anyway as everyone already has a cell phone or two or three that can take videos. How much will the China tariffs effect this company? How many bad quarters can GPRO have before it needs to file for a secondary offering?

Sure, pricing is different (lower margins?) and maybe there's a buyer out there? I think Woodman is the obstacle to a partnership.

3064,"I bought into gpro at the product launch in Oct. and thinking to ride it through the holiday. The blunder by management really killed the stock since then. There is still some hope if you are still in this thing like I am. Here is my analysis. From 2013-2015, gpro sold more than 15m units, if 1 in 5 hardcore gproers decides to upgrade then this is about 3mil new demand. I think that is what is happening based on my reading of reviews. If the 30% growth rate over last year can be sustained as indicated by black Friday number, then you can anticipate about 2.6 mil units sell though this holiday (last year number is about 2.0mil). The average ASP for 2016 is $262. So this amounts to $682mil in revenue. or if they can match the 2014 Q4 hero4 release number at 2.4 mil for $629 mil. So the guidance is still achievable without drone. The big question is if hero5 could sustain the 30% growth over 2015 Q4 and this is big if. On the other hand, hitting Q4 number is not going to move the stock as the street would question the sustainability of hero5 and growth. The fate of gpro hings on the karma unfortunately. That is only growth driver at near term. My bet is that gpro can right the ship by releasing karma by middle of January to generate enough momentum for a squeeze to the high teens.",0.9907

Yes, they fired HUNDREDS of employees this year to ""cut costs"" but that does not make one a truly profitable company, it is only smoke and mirrors in the short term. No one left to fire next year. HERO6 isn't a game changer, Fusion is a niche within a niche with VR NOT being widely accepted at all for at least the next few years, and Karma 2? Who cares.

Failed session year, Drone recall, whatever. 36% of the float is short, trading at @$10 on NO volume. Means that no more bad news will drive us longs out. GoPro has a synonymous brand, has acquired 3 software companies, and has a much larger vision than playing tug of war with DJI for drone sales. If you want to race drones by a DJI, great, Woodman will tell you the same thing. They do not provide a life solution tying the whole package together nor do they have the vision GPRO does. Even if it's still years in the making customers believe in the brand. It's cameras are built like a rock, and you can bet they won't sacrifice quality on the future of Karma. Lastly, GPRO has what the greatest companies in the world have; tactile greatness. When you see and feel an iPhone, or a macbook, they look and feel superior to anything else. Well, when you see and hold a hero5 you want it plain and simple, when you look at karma vs. any other drone, you want it. Longs (from any price) still holding are smart to do so, in a decade they will be a major media player in a market that doesn't exist yet and the shares have the potential to reach all-time highs. Non-believers are following Wall Street propaganda which is standard, but visionaries and artists can see that this is much more than ""just another holiday product"" as you'll be blasted with by the news and doubters because they're ""technical short-term critics."" Jobs was a decade ahead of technology, as GoPro is and will continue to be. 4K (streaming rate 25 MBits) is not provided/cheap/or easily accessible bandwidth to 70% of those paying for service. I began to recently doubt Nick's execution abilities recently but had to bring myself back to the ground and remember, 36% IS SHORT. THEY LEGALLY HAVE TO COVER PEOPLE. Let's not forget they aren't actual equity they're arbitrary shares in the float. You can be the biggest bear in the world and I'd still bet against you. GoPro, sounds superior when you say it, provides superior products when you see/touch/use it, and is now getting into easy-to-use editing and content delivery? Good luck to those who are short, but just know when the squeeze hits, it won't be a 10 or 20% increase like so in the past, it'll be a $10/$20 one. In the end, Brand name wins. You don't say tissue you say Kleenex. You don't say action camera you say GoPro. 2020 will be north of $100. Good day",0.9991

3327,"Okay, I’ve been watching this for a while. GoPro probably has a trick up their sleeve that will boost sales and make a pretty good profit. Cameras are now used EVERYWHERE. Yeah, they didn’t get on with the police cams, but there are still so many more opportunities for them. Maybe another company will not make Nick an offer. Maybe will go with the Chinese junk. Maybe GoPro will fizzle out and go away. But like it or not, believe it or not, the name and actual product is worth a hell of a lot. Everyone should know that. My bet is that it will go up nicely. The reasons to be bullish far outweigh reasons to be bearish. Now I’m in at about $4, so I have much less risk than those who bought in much higher.

Good brand in niche markets, simplified product line, and entering a hyper growth market at the right time. If they can fix Karma in short order this thing has good upside. The consumer drone market should come in around 500M this year and is projected to grow north of 1 Billion in the next 2 years with DJI owning 70% market share. IMO Karma capturing 20% marketshare in short order once they get going is realistic given their camera install base and it represents a great potential growing revenue stream for GoPro which solves a lot of problems. As a consumer who does not own a drone but considering one (they are too cool!) the purchase is a no-brainer based on flexibility. Getting a drone and a top of the line removable camera gives me two toys instead of one and I like getting the most bang for my buck. I don't know much about drones but it doesn't look like DJI's are removable. My two cents.",0.9964

And the company has strong branding.3) Just like any other stock, GoPro is also driven by Geo Political, interest rate adjustments, and all other noticeable market swings in general (such as yesterdaay).

3663,Hey every one I would like to put some numbers so you guys can have some insight to what I think about having another Q4 earnings beat. First of all many people who short GoPro saying Q3 revenue was less than last year I do agree but what’s the reason let’s see. While last year GoPro has Karma drones and GoPro cameras this year Q3 result were little less because they quit selling drones only about 85000 of those are reflected in this Q3 which will make about $8.5 million of revenue . Let’s see what if we did not have sold karma last year . By comparing that I think GoPro has been better this year because they sold more cameras as well as raised more revenue from camera business than last year Q3. Which means the top line business is improving . We will see this happening in Q4 as well and revenue will fall but my question is did this fundamentally mean GoPro is finally going to dust ? I don’t think so because last year they had Karma which contributed to the revenue . So even if revenue falls Q4 this doesn’t mean GoPro is closing it’s business. What I would compare is the units sold for cameras last Q4 with this year and the revenue and earnings generated from that same business. Best of luck to the shorts but this stock is dirt cheap just some people don’t understand how to do analysis .,0.989

3722,"Its funny to read these comments sometimes because everyone's opinion is based on different timelines. Perfect example, $GPRO will be sold, its not a matter of if,its more of when. Nick is young and he has taken the company from a standalone camera product to developing an ecosystem. I won't reiterate what the analysts say, both good and bad, because most of us have read them. But think about the big picture. Go Pro created the ""action camera"" category. Most will associate action cameras with Go Pro's and therefor refer to action cameras as most would associate YELP with reviews. I would say that both Go Pro and YELP serve as similar examples as definitive words defining what you saying without using ""review"" or ""action camera"" for example. Essentially, they are ingrained in our vocabulary. But that is just a point, not a valid reason to invest. But that shows you that Nick created a great product and yes at the hype of sales and everything else, this definitely should have traded where it once was. And based on the mishaps and decrease in sales Q over Q and Y over Y, this should be trading where it is now. But what most need to realize is that the street is divided in half with all the haters wanting to continue to hate, and all the longs saying its time for time this to rally and get back to where it should be, which is in the $20's. $APPL is my number one candidate to buy Go Pro and I would estimate that would fall within the $35 p/Share range. Don't ask me how that number came to light etc. etc. I have been working in finance all my life, I live in Newport Beach, actually have friends that were involved with the IPO and still are friends with the initial circle of friends that started this small company back in the day. Proprietary wise, they have created an ecosystem that will fall in nicely with AAPL. There are some other companies suitable for buying Go Pro, but I don't see them being a stand alone company for 2 more years. I see them launching the new product line 9/26, adding more key new hires from tech companies, I think its possible they return to profitability, and then rumors start to form. But keep in mind, Go Pro was one of the only few IPO's since 2010 (in tech sector) that actually turned a profit. They are extremely valuable on paper and with their recent mishap last year, they did trim the fat and re-organize early enough so that now they are primed for a bright future (assuming all the numbers make sense) and buyers like the new product line of course. But its inevitable that Nick sells this to AAPL. They have this unique relationship and when Tim Cook gave an interview on CNBC, not only were they using the Karma (and not disclosing on TV) Tim gave some free shout outs that was kinda odd. Sure, it can be read as nothing at all, but what if. I think AAPL is impressed with what they have done thus far, and I think that even with sales being down year over year, they just needed to learn things the hard way (stock went from $80 - $8), revamp, create and do things differently so that it can create the HERO 6 and have a following etc. etc. Anyways my two cents. Good luck. I do think 9/26 is a success. I expect more upside than downside, and with the short interest being so high, I am following the option contracts and going with the longs as they will be rewarded if you continue to see what happens, monitor, and I give this stock a price target of $22 come March when all the holiday sales have been factored in. If Go Pro beats the street's views across the board then, I see this breaking into the 30's. Now, YELP does $90M a quarter and they are trading at $38. Sometimes the brand recognition and value beyond what they are doing revenue wise makes more sense as you look at the bigger picture. And a few key industries that will succeed the retail market will be Film, TV, Porn etc. The growth of these action cameras, karmas, etc are essential to the way these reality and media content projects are created. I see Go Pro as the leader, will always be the leader, and one day just like BEATS BY DRE, will be in the APPL portfolio and easily adapted within the ifamily. Again, these are my two cents. Not arguing, makes no sense to do that. Just an investor that sees near-term upside and long-term upside. But I also see the market going down over the next 6 months. So if that happens everything I just said matters, but wont materialize for a while. Good luck to all.",0.9996

I have shared that I am long... but this stock has both pros and cons at this point. To comments below, 10.5M shares were traded yesterday -- a good indicator. But today isn't a good indicator as it is falling back a bit. This could be simple profit taking from those who bought in the 8s and 9s with concerns of locking in profits. Also the news yesterday was positive, but contained some speculation as well. I think this is a great camera company. But this whole drone thing might be like the other ventures GPRO has entered into. The drone market is tight, pricing is falling, and they have produced a product that is missing some key features. But GPRO has opportunities in both the personal electronic and commercial markets that can make this a stronger company. To everyone here, I don't see this being a $5 or a $20 stock as many have suggested. I'm in the middle around $12-$13 assuming they provide a solid plan going forward.

I think an easy 10+ before earnings and we might see a dip after earnings release on 2/2, I don't see much bad news left. I've read a lot of comments about whether or not Woodman is a good CEO. Well, a ""Good CEO"" doesn't allow 80%+ of his company value to vanish while missing deadlines and over/under estimating product demand. But GPRO has a good product as many here have pointed out.

4092,"The Karma Stick seems a little expensive, but minimal competition in this realm from 3rd parties. I own a Hero 4 Silver and would be very interested in owning this, given that a lot of my video is shaky and this would all but correct it. However, I think only your more ""extreme"" users will shell out $300.00 to purchase it. I mean, why wouldn't I just spend $400.00 more and get the drone too (when it is re-released). As for the Karma, it is coming back, and my guess it will be in Q1 2017. I don't believe that they are just ""fixing it"". I believe they received a luke warm reaction from the drone community and also saw what the DJI Mavic had. They will come out with a better Karma than before that also has their flight issues fixed. But like many have stated, the Karma wasn't built to save GoPro, its just another accessory / revenue driver. Their biggest money make should always be the cameras themselves. They just need to market the product for everyone, not just sports enthusiasts. I actually just bought my mother a Hero 4 Black over Christmas for $299.99 as it was $150 off and $100 cheaper than the Hero 5. She does outdoors stuff, but also has many grandkids as well. I am hoping she will use it as an every day camera, which is the exact market GoPro should be flocking to and compete with the likes of Canon and Nikon in the point and shoots. They have the name, they have the cache, now they need a better line of products that just don't build off owning a Hero 4 or 5. Of course they can also expand software wise with their Cloud, but they need to make it better and also free. Provide all owners with limited free Cloud space that can only maintain a certain quality and then offer upgrades that increases both space and quality. You first need to lure people to your service instead of starting it out at $4.99, especially when there are other free options out there. And when we think about competitors in the space, 3 come to mind. But quick, can you name them other than brand? No, most people cannot. When they think of ""action cam"" GoPro comes to mind first, not Nikon KeyMission, Sony Action Camera, or Garmin VIRB. Looking at Amazon review wise, The GoPro Hero 5 has a 4.1 rating on 125 reviews, the Nikon Keymission 360 has 1.9 rating on 108 reviews, the Sony FDRX3000 has a 4.8 rating on 9 reviews and the Garmin has a 4.1 rating on 48 reviews. So comparing the Hero5 against the competitors, it has one of the highest ratings and the most reviews. Looking at Best Buy, the Hero5 has 545 reviews, the Nikon has 21, the Sony with 59 and they do not carry the Garmin. Review scores are pretty similar to Amazon. In conclusion, they have a great product (camera) and they have loads of cool and profitable accessories. Their first intro to the drone market was a doozy, but I expect them to come out with a better version in the next few months. I also believe most respective buyers were already owners of GoPros and so I see those sales coming at a later date vs to a competitor. What they need to do is execute better, have a broader camera line and a revamped online platform that can generate cash. Right now, they have poor execution. So if you believe they can turn it around, I believe they have the product and market to be successful. But if you don't believe in their leadership, then I would not buy into their Stock. I personally believe that leadership will eventually execute properly or be bought out before they go obsolete. I mean if you look product wise, Nikon dipped their toes into the Action Cam market and failed miserably. This is just a random though out of left field, but Nikon could acquire GoPro and have their sports action cam market fulfilled instead of pumping money into R&D and failing to compete.",0.9996

Anticipating some movement next week prior to Thursday based on anticipation unless there are changes in analyst ratings or other news releases prior. Technically speaking, we are actually overbought, but seem to be holding strong. Personally looking for low 11s, but wouldn't be surprised to see 12s Friday (next Friday). I think projections were drastically cut so GoPro would beat estimates combined with strong sales. Also, Karma sales and write-downs may already be factored into estimates provided on the last call. Guidance will be very important going forward. Side note -- there was a good article on valuation about GoPro being at 1x gross sales. Seems low, guidance will help dictate direction and multipliers.

From Zacks : ""GoPro estimates its fourth-quarter revenues to come in at about $470 million (+/- 10 million). This figure represents a 13% contraction from last year's tally and a massive 26% decline from 2014’s fourth quarter. And GoPro suffered from major supply-chain issues last year which meaningfully impacted the holiday season, which should also be taken into account in year-over-year comparisons.Projected full-year 2017 results don't look good either, and actually reflect negligible growth when normalized for supply-chain issues and messed-up product launches which supposedly hurt growth. Additionally, a free cash flow shortfall, and continued margin compression are other red flags that cast doubts over GoPro’s growth story.Evidently, weakness in the holiday season of 2017 would likely spill over to the first half of next year as well. And we have yet to talk about the intense competition and soft demand that GoPro faces.As GoPro grappled with production delays and bungled-up product roll outs, it lost significant ground to competitors like Sony Corp. SNE, Garmin Ltd. GRMN and Nikon Corp. NINOY. Amid an onslaught of tough competition and reviewers increasingly recommending cheaper alternatives, we believe GoPro's market share faces a very real threat.""",0.818

Ultimately, that combination means that this company will never produce big profits. In the lack of big profits, GPRO stock doesn’t deserve to fetch a price tag north of $5 today.GoPro has turned into a small revenue company with anemic margins and no profits. Will things turnaround? Unlikely. The fundamentals underlying the action camera market aren’t going to change anytime soon, so unless GoPro finds some way to more deeply monetize its already existing ecosystem of users, the action camera maker will likely remain a low growth, low margin company.""",0.2289
4502,The problem with the Hero line of cameras is most people just aren’t smart enough to figure it out It’s not just a action camera it’s a video camera but it takes a little effort to get the perfect footage it can produce In this day and age everyone expects stuff to be Alexa After a week with the 6 I can say it’s better then the Sony video camera I paid 2 k for three years ago,0.9441
4503,"Woodman is Scott McNealy 2.0. If you don't know who he is google him and see how things turned out for his company. GPRO will never make another $499 camera and soon the $399 price point will fail to sell. Prices have nowhere to go but down from here. GPRO peaked with the Hero 4 the year they went public @24. Woodman has laid off almost half his staff, just to turn a profit. My question has always been why Woodman hired them in the first place. This was a great short when it went public, now it's dead money.",0.3499

4512,"It amazes me about how much focus there is on the product rather than the performance of the company. I'm not saying not to buy stock in something you believe in. APPL, DIS and others are great examples of this. Yet they can execute. It is also funny to see the number of critics here who don't like the word ""consolidate"" or ""chartists"". To you Mark -- you don't add anything here other than a constant stream of negative babble while pumping the stock with no basis. You like their products. Great. Same for you jbrad. 4 days ago you made a statement about today. Odd... I don't see much going on. I realize if you tell the future enough times, you might eventually get one right, but you're not even close to 50/50 -- so maybe a little less criticism and a little more anything useful. And maybe learn how to string a couple sentences together.For those holding, seems a premature turn to the 9s -- nothing significant has been announced and volumes are flat after the institutional shedding one day last week. Hard to say exactly where we go from here. There should be new headlines regarding the lawsuit in the next few weeks as they pair down all the individual lawsuits into a single case. Charts show slightly oversold long term. Seems like anything 8s presents a buying opportunity.Now for those who will comment (mark, jbrad), I've not been shy about disclosing how much and at what price I own this stock at. But had anyone taken your advice before earnings, they now would be sitting on a stock worth less now than it was trading for at that time. As I've said before, I jumped in WAAAAY too late on this stock in the last rise, so I'm still in the red. Unlike you both, I do make mistakes from time to time. But if the stock goes up, like now, I'm not going to complain. Good luck to those holding. Shorts might want to rethink things as we don't seem to be falling much further if at all.",0.9924

That said, probably not many here would argue the fact that the BOD and Nick aren't doing their jobs. Then again, there are methods to address that issue.Travis -- Go Pro isn't basing that much on the Karma. Its a new product. I've discussed this yesterday. I do agree things are not good right now. But seriously $5? That would be like me saying it will be $25 tomorrow. And depending on the actual issue, hard to say how long any fix would take. They never quantified the actual number of units having the issue.Can the stock go down? Of course. But it seems to be holding strong at these levels. As I said yesterday, I was hoping for $9 to average down, but its not looking like that will happen -- again Nick -- not a challenge. All technicals are suggesting oversold at this point, so we will probably solidify in this range and head up before we head down again. Of course some sustained positive news might actually sustain a rally -- but it will need to be something real and substantial and not Nick flying his Karma around off the deck of his boat.Just my 2 cents.

Glad I don't own any GPRO stock!!!,0.9197
4561,"So a couple days ago, I posted saying we would have smooth sailing unless cameras started blowing up (like the Samsung) or drones started falling out of the sky. Clearly I should be writing that GPRO will hit 20. I've read the various posts here and it is almost mind numbing.On the one hand, yes, they are recalling 2500 drones. Given that was all that could have been sold, there is little point to saying how many more ""could"" have sold. However given I do sales analysis for a living including metric development, it would seem more would have sold if available. Then again, a good thing they weren't. Used units cannot be resold, so this will end up being a write-down or write-off. And thankfully no one was hurt. Many here fail to realize that this may be covered under insurance -- so the company might not be taking a hit at all, other than sales. Given how quickly GoPro reacted, it all seems a good thing and yes, people will purchase it when this all settles down. I would point you all to the Samsung 7 and various iPhones after multiple issues.What is troubling to me is if they knew about this during earnings. I'd rather one lump sum of bad news rather than the constant pings. We recover, then hit again. What else lies in wait? Also, why did this happen in the first place? Bad QA? And if so, should we expect anything with the GoPro Hero? I would hesitate to say no only because it is a more mature product.If we can stop hearing bad news aside from the jibberish of analysts and shorts here, it would seem there is only up to go from anticipated strong sales and eventually re-releasing the Karma. I'm not sure what more could go wrong at this point -- and please understand Nick... this isn't a challenge. Preserve shareholder value and do your freaking job.",0.9827

A sign someone knows something that will move the stock as little as half a buck? 2) I visited a Best Buy here in Los Angeles last night. While there, I took a look at the Karma display. Not like the old days. Adequate display, but not as good as the competition, of which there was plenty. The salesman said sales are picking up, but were not strong as people's trust is never good following a recall. One positive is that the camera can be removed and used without the drone. Customers have commented on that. However, designed to have a wide view, the GoPro lens may not be optimal for shots at altitude. 3) Article after article appears on the Net citing GoPro as an excellent takeover target for companies such as Google, Apple, Snap, etc. Mind you, it's all coming from a journalist's keyboard, but there is a lot of sentimentality in that direction. 4) There are also numerous articles on sites such as Glassdoor that continuously cite the company as a good place to work, but experience frustrations with upper management with the CEO being at the center of their frustrations.Nothing here reveals the future path of GoPro, but between the infighting, I'm hoping someone else can contribute intelligent thoughts.

I locked myself into an inner chamber that reinforced my own biases... For the fun of it, here is what one such expert is thinking right now about this company. +++++++++++++++++The current technical condition of GPRO is weak. The underlying indicators are negative and a reversal of the existing trend seems unlikely at this time. The stock has underperformed the market when compared to the S&P 500 over the last 50 trading days. The MACD-LT is confirming that the intermediate-term trend is bearish. GPRO's chart formation indicates the stock is in a strong downward trend. Over the last 50 trading sessions, there has been more volume on down days than on up days indicating that GPRO is under distribution, which is a bearish condition. The stock is trading below a falling 50-day moving average which confirms the weak technical condition of GPRO. In addition, GPRO is below its falling 200-day moving average.+++++++++++++++",0.8489

Given Robert and Andy’s passion for next-level visual effects, we’re really excited for what our future holds with them as a part of our team.”The ultra-creative duo of Robert McIntosh and Andy Russell share backgrounds in film and video games, fostering a unique skill set that intersects the arts and technology and have a passion for enabling creators of all skills to easily make cinematic content that “looks expensive.”In a few short years, ReelSteady has built a passionate following within the FPV drone community with the cinematic features and effects their ReelSteady products enable.We expect their background, skills and passion will help us continue to grow our software efforts and develop more ways across our app ecosystem to help our customers create cinematic visual effects and premium editing features.You may recognize some content that has been powered by their products—like this Longboard Freestyle video and this micro-drone video that went viral a few years back (created by Robert, himself).“Everything we’ve done so far has had no official link to GoPro, and now as part of the team, everything we create will be embedded from within GoPro,” Andy says. “We are excited, especially for our customers, for what is to come—collaboration as part of the GoPro Team to create amazing things that will enhance the GoPro experience for everybody.”So what does this mean for ReelSteady customers? No changes in the immediate future. ReelSteady products will continue to be sold on the ReelSteady website and supported by GoPro customer support. But what all ReelSteady and GoPro customers should be excited about is the magic that Andy and Robert will bring to the work being done across the GoPro App ecosystem to enhance the cinematic output of your content.“Its feels kind of like we pulled the golden ticket and are going to Wonka’s factory to see how the products we’ve used for years are made,” said Robert. “We are huge GoPro fans. We built a company and product to specifically serve GoPro users and are fired up to join the GoPro Family to continue creating solutions from the inside.

4625,Every single time. GoPro screws up every new device. From karma drone to camera launches. I regret selling too soon but I knew the move of production from China to Mexico would not go smoothly. Guadalajara Mexico is a drug infested city. No one goes into the city except drug dealers. Decapitated (seriously) bodies found just outside city. On many occasions. Not only will there be delays but quality of the Hero 8 will not be good. GoPro should have gone to Vietnam. There are no tech factories in that area of Mexico that produce anything of quality. If GoPro thought this move would be lateral in cost and quality they would have originated production there. GoPro was trying to save some money and this is result. DJI new osmo action 2 will destroy hero 8 and be launched before hero 8. What a mess. Yet another year of burning cash.,0.989

4627,"Longtime lurker here. All of you here are pretty funny. You definitely keep me entertained. Been a longtime GoPro fan and bought in around 10 myself. Just wanted to say that I was at Bestbuy the other day and saw a kid with his family picking up a couple GoPro5's and I asked the employee how much of them have she sold and she stated they were selling like hotcakes....~300 or so this holiday season. Plenty of Bestbuys in the area so I am not sure if this is a good thing for the stock or not but I wanted to mention it. I have strong faith in the GoPro brand as they've always captured the market with their brand like Apple does. I also think their product is superior in most ways. DJI is cool and I own their drone...but they really make it pretty annoying to set up and get everything configured. Which is the reason why I was excited for the Karma, simple, intuitive and easy from the looks of it. Might not have all the features but it does cater to the average user who just wants an easy shot for their videos. Anyways, I am just rambling now...but I am long and have faith GoPro will pull through!! Keep with the updates everyone, I appreciate both negative and positive comments.",0.9974

4629,"I was a believer in GPRO before coronavirus. But one can only imagine that sales are coming to a grinding halt. We already knew that Q1 figures would not be pretty because of excess inventory in the channel. Q2 will likely be a disaster. I can't see there being any demand at all right now for their products. it would not surprise me if revenue for 2020 is 50% below 2019...or more. This means that debt levels will increase, or the company will mint/sell shares, or both. If there was no coronavirus, my thoughts would be different, as GPRO was one of my largest holdings. I dumped last week because I see this heading lower. This is a product category that is both travel-related and non-essential, meaning that holders run a much higher risk of seeing further declines.",-0.5218

Hopefully, pushers of this stock are real unconflicted individuals. I am also hoping that I am wrong. I've seen too many tailspins like this to bury my head in the sand. So what, they now have 2 billion views, this stock has tanked more than 90% from its high point! Quadrupling of the value via earnings will be nice.
