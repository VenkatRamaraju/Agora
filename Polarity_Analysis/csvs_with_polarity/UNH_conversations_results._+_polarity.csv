I wonder what happens when middle American dries up. We all we know shortly. I wish now I had worked in the Government as they hold all the cards for free healthcare, nice lucrative retirements, great pay (Sanders wealth is in the 1% go of Americans) and void of the laws they pass, they are exempt.

135,"Two notes from Credit Suisse. #1Next Steps in the Courts: Opening briefs were filed with the Court ofAppeals on Monday. Our Washington consultant notes that the court leansquite conservatively. In our consultant’s view, this case will likely go to theSupreme Court on appeal sometime during 2020, where the ACA wouldlikely be upheld. This is consistent with the view of Professor Neil Siegel,who we hosted for a conference call in December. Mr. Siegel was unsureabout how the Court of Appeals will rule, but he believes that this is theweakest court challenge to the ACA to date, and the Supreme Court hasalready upheld the ACA against two previous court challenges. The fivejustices who upheld the ACA (including Chief Justice Roberts) remain onthe court at this point. In fact, Mr. Siegel said that the likelihood of theSupreme Court upholding the District Court’s ruling is “close to zero.”#2.CNC and Some Hospitals Are Most Exposed Among Our CoveredCompanies: Hospitals have not disclosed their ACA exposure in recentyears. However, based on prior disclosures, we estimate low teenspercentage EBITDA exposure to the ACA for CYH (both Medicaidexpansion and public exchanges) and 3-7% EBITDA exposure for UHS,HCA, and THC. Among our covered MCOs, CNC has the largest exposureto the ACA (both public exchanges and Medicaid expansion). MCOs withfairly limited exposure include ANTM (Medicaid expansion and exchanges),CI (modest exchange exposure), and UNH (Medicaid expansion). Weestimate HIX and Medicaid expansion together likely contribute close to40% of earnings for CNC, 3-4% of EPS for ANTM, and less than 1% for CIand UNH. HUM has no meaningful ACA exposure. In addition, the DistrictCourt’s decision would end all other ACA provisions such as closing theMedicare Part D donut hole, as well as the health insurer fee.",-0.9974

152,"UnitedHealth: A Great Buffett-Style Blue Chip BuyApr. 17, 2019 7:00 PM•UNHSummaryI'm a big proponent of buying blue-chip dividend growth stocks when the market hates them most.UnitedHealth recently crashed to a new 52-week low, due to heightened (but likely overblown) regulatory/political risks.While regulatory/political risk is something all healthcare investors need to be comfortable with, UnitedHealth enjoys a wide moat, excellent dividend safety, and world-class management.Today, this level 11 (out of 11) quality SWAN stock is trading at a 1% to 26% discount to fair value and likely to deliver 13% to 20% CAGR total returns over the coming five to 10 years.Just remember that risk management is paramount, so keep your position size and sector exposure to reasonable levels. I and Simply Safe Dividends recommend 5%/25% position/sector caps for most investors.(Source: imgflip)After five years as a professional investment analyst/writer, I've learned a lot about what long-term investing strategies work well, which is why I've shifted my retirement portfolio (where I keep 100% of my life savings) to a pure undervalued blue-chip dividend growth approach.My specific approach is inspired by Warren Buffett's concept of ""fat pitch"" investing. That means only buying quality blue-chip dividend growth stocks, at good to great prices (estimated discount to fair value and preferably near 52-week or even multi-year lows), specifically when Wall Street hates them most.This helps not only minimize the risk of a permanent loss of capital (""rule #1 never lose money, rule #2 never forget about rule #1"") but also maximizes the chance of earning market-beating double-digit returns over time.(Source: Ycharts)Last week UnitedHealth (UNH) popped up on my watchlist after falling near its 52-week low. I set my limit orders and was thrilled to have one of them fill on Monday, April 15th, beginning a $2,000 starter position. During United's post-earnings conference call 10% collapse two more limits filled, tripling my initial stake while reducing my cost basis to $222.66.I would have bought four limits worth, however, that $6,000 investment in United Health raised my healthcare exposure (elevated after a total of $28,000 worth of healthcare deep value blue-chip buys in the last three weeks) to 21%, above my personal 20% sector limit.Thus, I'm now slightly overweight healthcare and will need to dilute down my portfolio with new buys in non-overweight sectors (anything other than energy, REITs or healthcare).So, let's take a look at why I'm such a fan of United Healthcare, especially now that it's 23% off its all-time high. More importantly, learn why Wall Street is so bearish on this blue-chip now, why those fears are likely overblown, and why I consider UnitedHealth a classic Buffett buy now. That's both under his famous advice to ""buy wonderful companies at a fair price rather than fair companies at a wonderful price"" as well as to ""be greedy when others are fearful.""Why The Market Is Worried About United HealthBlue-chips of United's caliber don't fall so hard and fast without the market being afraid of something. So, let's take a look at this health insurer's risk profile, so you can determine whether this dividend growth stock is a good fit for your portfolio.First, let's discuss the elephant in the room, and the cause of United's (and the entire health insurance industry's) big Tuesday intraday plunge. That was the result of what the CEO said during the latest conference call.The wholesale disruption of American health care being discussed in some of these proposals would surely jeopardize the relationship people have with their doctors, destabilize the nation's health system, and limit the ability of clinicians to practice medicine at their best. And the inherent cost burden would surely have a severe impact on the economy and jobs, all without fundamentally increasing access to care. The path forward is to achieve universal coverage and it could be substantially reached through existing public and private platforms. Meaningful progress in health care lives and national and state leaders continuing to work collaboratively with the innovative and proven private sector solutions to achieve the goals we all want, a modern, reliable, informed, and aligned health care system that offers the access, choice, and coverage protections people seek at a fair cost to the individuals and society as a whole."" - David Wichmann (emphasis added)What Wichmann is talking about is Medicare For All, which is the single-payer proposal first outlined by Senator Bernie Sanders in his 2016 presidential bid, but that's now being endorsed by numerous Democratic presidential hopefuls.The impetus for Medicare for All is the belief that if the US government becomes the sole provider of healthcare then it will be able to extract drastic price reductions, either through bulk negotiations or outright price controls.

Medicare benefits are more generous because it covers older Americans who by and large worked many years and paid Medicare taxes for many years working and plus they are a large voting base who turn out to vote so politicians don’t mess with this group health benefits.What Sanders is describing would actually be less similar to Medicare and more like a stripped down Medicaid health insurance and really be a downgrade in coverage for most. Over 50% of Americans have private health insurance and I doubt they want to trade that in for a inferior “Medicare for all” plan, which by the way no politician or government worker will participate in because the benefit sucks so bad. So I doubt the current Medicare aged, working private insured, or government employed want this.

""When they say Medicare for All, people have to understand this: Medicare for All is not as good a benefit as the Affordable Care Act. It doesn't have catastrophic [coverage] - you have to go buy it. It doesn't have dental. It's not as good as the plans that you can buy under the Affordable Care Act. So I say to them, come in with your ideas, but understand that we're either gonna have to improve Medicare - for all, including seniors - or else people are not gonna get what they think they're gonna get. And by the way, how's it gonna be paid for?Now, single-payer is a different thing. People use the terms interchangeably. Sometimes it could be the same thing, but it's not always. Single-payer is just about who pays. It's not about what the benefits are. That is, administratively, the simplest thing to do, but to convert to it? Thirty trillion dollars [over 10 years]. Now, how do you pay for that?So I said, 'Look, just put them all on the table, and let's have the discussion, and let people see what it is. But know what it is that you're talking about."" All I want is the goal of every American having access to health care. You don't get there by dismantling the Affordable Care Act. As Californians have said to me, ""We get billions and billions of dollars out of the Affordable Care Act coming into California. Now they want to get rid of that.' How are they gonna go to single-payer in California without the money from the Affordable Care Act?""",0.9962

It's also rated a 4-star buy by Morningstar and a Buy by Merrill Lynch. Current price of $205.58. CFRA's target is $352; Morningstar's is $304 and Merrill's is $345. Beta is 1.09 and short interest is .93. All looks good as well as safe but maybe not.....my concern is hospitals will be at full capacity but many of those folks may be without insurance coverage - either from getting fired/laid off from this crisis and/or from not having insurance coverage to begin with. Additionally, many smaller and even bigger employers may go under and no longer pay premiums and cancel plans. I'm not sure how big an issue this could be but it is one worth taking into consideration. Also consider many of these hospitalizations may likely be for critical care - ventilator-required, etc. which are typically very high revenue charges but - if the folks are on plans - UNH, Anthem or any other insurers will be strained for profits. I might very well be missing something so comments are appreciated.",0.99

His could get very very ugly because I seen no buyers until the close and no way those buyers just showed up. That was the specialist and MM being nice trying to keep an orderly market. If this pops anytime at the open or soon after then it will be a short lived bounce and I’d sell half. Or all because this stock is going lower. I guess weak holders are selling because the chart is broken and elizebeth warren is catching dementia Joe. Funny thing is that everyone in the democrat party is talking Medicare for all but seriously that isn’t going to happen. Too many people work in healthcare and too many people are all ready on Medicare that worked and waited their whole lives to be on Medicare that Warren will never pass it. Never.

The issue that gov't has with pharmacy benefit managers is that they keep rebates instead of giving them to patients. UNH has been proactive in this respect and is committed to giving the rebates directly to patients. Second issue is risk of medicare for all. As a physician with 30 years experience I am confident that this WILL NOT HAPPEN. Certainly not with Trump as POTUS. Even if democrats win in 2020 would take a 60-40 vote in Senate which is extremely unlikely. If by some remote chance that the bill were ever to pass, UNH will still be in great shape. The fact is that the government does not have the skill or resources to manage the care of 300 million lives. They will do exactly what they do with current Medicare Advantage plans. They outsource the lives to HMO's and pay a capitated payment(dollars per member per month) to the insurance company. UNH does very well on these plans as they can control the doctor panel , hospital payments and drug costs. UNH does this better than any other HMO. I know, as I had to deal with them for 30 painful years. They fight hard to control utilization and costs. At the end of the day, this is a great company with sound fundamentals.

Optum’s revenue crossed the $100 billion level for the first time, helping to add to the $3.10 EPS in the quarter. UNH earned $12.19 a share for the full year, valuing the stock at 20.8 times earnings. Its 2019 EPS outlook for 2019 is even better, with net earnings expected to come in at $13.70 - $14.00 a share. That brings down the forward P/E to 15.3 times.These multiples are noteworthy because UNH’s revenue growth will likely accelerate at a faster rate, thanks to the positive contributions of Optum. In 2018, the unit only added modestly to results. Yet as UNH continues to dedicate itself to improving health and wellness, saving money for the customers it serves, profits will grow.UnitedHealth added 2.4 million more people in 2018.

1543,"We look for some additional developments around the Trump Administration’s drug price initiatives in 2019. Efforts to encourage greater use of generics and biosimilars are positive for MCOs, as are removing protected drugs and drugs classes, as these steps allow health insurers to negotiate better discounts and rates. On November 26th, CMS released its CY20 proposed rule for Medicare Advantage and Part D drug pricing. CMS is proposing to give MA and Part D plans the option to limit coverage of drugs from formularies in the six categories known as the “protected classes”. One of the tools proposed would be to allow step therapy, similar to the policy allowed for Part B drugs in 2019. This move underscores our view that insurers (and potentially PBMs) are necessary partners in their efforts to lower drug costs. CMS is also considering for a future plan year, which may be as early as 2020, a policy that would ensure that enrollees pay the lowest cost for prescription drugs they pick up at a pharmacy, after taking into account back-end payments from pharmacies to plans through POS rebates. If the industry is given sufficient time to put in place the appropriate bids (implementation after Jan 1 2020) and other mechanisms to reflect the new POS rebate scheme, we believe there would be minimal financial impact to health plans and PBMs. Further, to the extent that Part B converges with Part D, as some Part B drugs are allowed to be negotiated under Part D, it would allow health insurers to bring PBM techniques into the Medicare Part B program (which currently is unmanaged). Additionally, there will continue to be considerable focus in 2019 on any developments out of Amazon’s foray into the pharmacy space, as well as its JV with Berkshire and JPMorgan. Is",0.9939

These so-called backdoor deals are suspected by lawmakers of increasing drug costs for patients.It is “very likely” lawmakers force drug companies to give those rebates to consumers instead, starting as early as next year, Gupte said.Separately, a federal appeals court in New Orleans said Wednesday that it will hear arguments in July on a lawsuit backed by President Donald Trump to overturn Obamacare.

They need to keep their heads down and run the company, let the politicians say what ever they say, and ignore them.

I expect this company to deliver strong earnings, beats on EPS and Revenue consensus estimates, along with positive forward Guidance, and I expect the stock price will react positively, climbing up through the $290's and perhaps breaking $300 on Wednesday. Company has an OUTSTANDING Earnings History. Analyze the past TWENTY quarters of earnings releases. Going back 20 quarters, they have beaten the EPS consensus estimates ALL TWENTY times. And Revenue consensus estimates?? They beat 18 out of 20, and the two misses were absolutely TINY, 0.1% or less on both. Such a record is rare, and speaks to quality management at the top, and excellent financial discipline. I like the sector, and this stock is currently fairy valued. It is not cheap, but if you analyze all financial data, you see the valuation is okay. There is plenty of upside potential to $300+ in the near-term, and every reason to think a very good earnings report can give us a pop very close to if not above $300. Analysts are currently very bullish on this one, and I see few headwinds that could result in a downturn following the earnings release.

2439,"From Barron's..........Leerink’s Ana Gupte and John Sourbeer see “improved odds” of passage by the Sept. 30 reconciliation deadline. In that event, the pair sees greater earnings downside for companies levered to Obamacare in the near term than the previous House and Senate repeal-and-replace efforts.Gupte and Sourbeer offer these details regarding the hows, the whys and the which ones.Specifically, the bill proposes flat funding for Exchanges and Medicaid expansion through a block grant of $136 B in 2020, unchanged from the current ACA baseline in 2017. We expect that this contemplates an absolute reduction in funding in 2018 and 2019 to smooth the transition while any HIX related stabilization could be limited. The bill is more benign in the medium term 2020 to 2026 than previous Repeal and Replace proposals AHCA and BCRA with a mid-single-digit funding CAGR from $136 B to $200 B in block grants by 2026. Further, the funding is designed to drive a more level playing field between current expansion and non-expansion States. Medicaid HMOs CNC (MP) and MOH (OP) in particular that are levered to the ACA across both Exchanges and Medicaid expansion are likely to be impacted to the downside even in the near term 2018-2019. Hospitals are also likely to face downside but to a lesser extent. Diversified MCOs are more defensive particularly HUM (OP) and CI (OP), though we see the exposure as manageable even for AET (MP), UNH (OP), and ANTM (OP). Further, we expect that the bill may potentially be able to fund a delay or repeal of the Obamacare Health Insurer Provider Fee through tax reform if it should successfully pass legislation. Key upcoming catalysts include a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Sept. 25th with a floor vote before month-end through reconciliation.",0.9254

Then, I expect the dem candidate, whoever it is, to rush for the political center... That should ease the pressure on UNH somewhat over summer and fall.. Then if the dem wins, all bets are off.. Last November, even with the Dems winning congress Unh kept rising and it peaked in December 2018... then the political drumbeat for single payer took it down ...The existential political threat of single payer has reared its head twice before, under Hillary care (something like a 90% drop) and under Obamacare (about a 75% price drop) Those events were followed by amazing price rises... but I’m sure that fears of similar price falls are the real issue here.. So, this really isn’t a falling knife.. it’s a wait and see game .. If warren gets the nomination it will be a rough ride.. But if trump prevails and the political clouds clear.. this stock will be awesome, probably bumping $400 in 2021..

Not sure that is something for this country. Also, what happens to the two million employees of healthcare insurance companies that will be out of a job. That is not to mention the companies themselves, such as UNH and the stockholders of all these companies. On top of that if there is only one healthcare system all the technology platforms and companies that drive them out there will be out of business too. Same story on their employees and the companies themselves. Also, cutting the cost of drugs from pharma companies by as much as 70% is bound to have a large negative impact on them. To accomplish this massive shift to a national healthcare system it would take a generation of shift as this could not happen in a short time frame.
