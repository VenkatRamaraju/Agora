It is no coincidence that the go to tangible value is in the tech heavy Nasdaq that has seen some of its stellar performers take a serious haircut. Unfortunately the indexes like the DOW and S&P haven't been immune either which explains in large part why Boeing won't see any sustainable rally until Bitcoin is completely washed out. This situation is no different than the VIX blowup that created mayhem in the markets and caused some big players to close their doors. At the root of that crisis were gamblers who were betting that volatility would remain low forever and rolled over their VIX contracts continously and watched the cash roll in. It was better than CDs....Until volatility spiked....I've been around 40 years and I've seen gambling and outright greed. We pay for it....,-0.5968

The rise in the year-over-year delivery figure could primarily be attributable to the return of the 737 MAX into service in November 2020, thus boosting the company’s first-quarter plane deliveries.In its defense and space business, Boeing’s deliveries totaled 42 in first-quarter 2021, which witnessed a slight improvement from 39 dispatched in the prior-year period (read more: Boeing Reports Solid Q1 Commercial & Defense Deliveries).",0.9411

Let this go to the end of this week and you'll be seeing half of May deliveries impacted. That's a lot of monthly revenue BA is losing. To get the stock price to accelerate upward, the market needs something tangible like resumed deliveries and resumed revenue. Until that happens, most big fund traders aren't going to speculate on BA. The Max electrical issue is dragging on long enough that it's probably going to have a measurably negative impact on 2Q earnings, especially if we get all the way to the end of May and still don't have a fix.

833,"Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co. will need to inspect hundreds of undelivered 737 Max jets for a potential flaw in their electrical power systems, said people familiar with the matter.About 450 Max planes built since early 2019 could potentially require repairs, a total that includes about 90 aircraft in commercial operation, said the people, who asked not to be named because the matter is private. Boeing earlier Friday instructed airlines to ground dozens of recently delivered 737 Max jets to check for the manufacturing defect.The problem renews scrutiny of the upgraded 737 model, whose success is critical to helping Boeing recover from the coronavirus pandemic after burning through $20 billion in cash last year. While analysts expect the affected planes to be flying within a few days, U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg underscored the heightened concerns around the Max after two fatal crashes prompted the longest jetliner grounding in U.S. history. “We need to make sure there’s full confidence before these specific aircraft return to the air,” he said at a White House briefing. The Federal Aviation Administration will closely monitor the situation, he said.The production flaw “could affect the operation of a backup power control unit,” the FAA said in a statement. The agency said it’s in contact with the airlines and Boeing “and will ensure the issue is addressed.” The temporary flying halt disrupted travel as airlines rushed to line up replacement aircraft. U.S. carriers including Southwest Airlines Co., American Airlines Group Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. parked a combined 67 of the workhorse planes Friday, about a third of all Max jets in service worldwide. The manufacturing glitch affects a subset of aircraft at 16 airlines, not the entire Max fleet, Boeing said in a statement.Most of the affected planes are still in storage and already face a lengthy check-up before they will be handed over to customers. Boeing wouldn’t disclose how many planes will need to be inspected for the manufacturing glitch.“We’re taking steps in production to correct this potential issue and ensure it has been addressed in every airplane we deliver,” said Boeing spokeswoman Jessica Kowal. Boeing is “implementing short- and long-term corrective actions to address the issue prior to resuming aircraft deliveries,” a European Union Aviation Safety Agency spokesman said.Faded LusterWhile the problem isn’t related to the flight-control system that was at the center of the Max’s nearly two-year grounding, it takes some of the luster off the comeback of Boeing’s most important product. U.S. regulators lifted the flying ban in November, clearing Boeing to resume delivering the jets for the first time since March 2019. The 737 provided a sales lift with a bumper commitment from Southwest, which had publicly flirted with a smaller single-aisle jet made by Airbus SE.“The fix seems to be well understood and timing would depend on availability of technicians and equipment access,” Sheila Kahyaoglu, an analyst at Jefferies with a buy rating on the stock, wrote in a research note to clients. “Changing the equipment could take hours or days to fix, a modest disruption.” Boeing fell 1% to $252.36 at the close in New York, the third-largest drop on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The shares have gained 18% this year, nearly double the Dow’s increase.The newest disclosure is the latest in a string of quality lapses and manufacturing flaws that have damaged Boeing’s reputation and afflicted its 787 Dreamliner, KC-46 military aerial tanker and Starliner spacecraft. The aerospace titan also has fired and sued a subcontractor on another high-profile project: turning two 747 jumbo jets into the next Air Force One fleet to haul U.S. presidents.The electrical issue disclosed Friday was discovered by Boeing mechanics “on a production airplane during normal build activity,” according to a message to customers that was reviewed by Bloomberg. Operators were notified just hours after a separate email had touted the growing number of flight hours and planes in service since the grounding ended. “Boeing has traced the issue to a production change made in the installation process that occurred after our last aircraft was delivered before the fleet grounding in March 2019, which means 24 of our 737 Max aircraft are not affected by this issue,” David Seymour, American’s operations chief, said in a message to employees.While Chicago-based Boeing is still working with regulators to finalize the repairs needed, it doesn’t anticipate the procedures will be lengthy. “It could take a matter of hours or a few days,” said Kowal, the Boeing spokeswoman.Airline ImpactSouthwest said it pulled 30 Max 8 jets from its schedule, adding that it is flying only 15 of its 58 Max planes daily",0.8851

853,"This movement also shows the importance to novice investors of patience and investing without emotion. Invest your money based on fundamentals, not on an emotional feeling of wanting to get rich quick. If that's what you're in the market for, you might just as well go to Vegas. Do your research, determine what you believe a stock is actually worth based on the underlying fundamentals of the corporation (or fund), NOT on what you ""hope"" it will be, and if there's a profit there, invest and don't worry about temporary market swings. If the company is worth a certain price, it *will* get there eventually. On a daily basis, the market seems chaotic. Over the long-term, however, the market is fundamentally rational. Take the long-term view after doing proper research and you'll make your money. But if you start freaking out over temporary market fluctuations, that's a sure way to lose a ton of money. BA is worth probably around $100+ *more* than it's trading today. The company has lots of hurdles to overcome over the next few years, so it will NOT get there overnight.

Masks and other health precautions will be required.California is reporting just under 2,900 new Covid-19 cases per day, based on a weekly average, a near 32% decline compared with a week ago, according to a CNBC analysis of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

The 220 strike price is probably not in play at this point as it would cost too much to wage that fight. Absent some kind of big news between today and tomorrow that drives the price up, I'm going to guess 230 is out of reach for the put sellers to bid the price up that high as well. As with last Friday, the battle royale is going to be fought between the 225 and the 227.50 contract sellers.

Shares are now trading comfortably above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and are within reach of the 52-week high price of $278.57 set earlier this month.Much of the optimism surrounding Boeing has to do with several airline companies ordering new planes to boost their fleets in anticipation of both domestic and global travel reopening. In February, for the first time since late 2019, Boeing recorded more aircraft sales than cancellations, as it delivered 82 planes compared to 51 cancellations.

1605,Boeing lost it's way a long time ago. Over the years they have outsourced production of critical parts while lowering quality standards. They spent more on stock buybacks than in R&D for decades. Because management didn't like working closely with their engineers (they made their head hurt) they moved headquarters to Chitcago to get away from their engineers. Meanwhile they indulged themselves with outsized pay packages and bonuses. Knowing the problems of the 737 MAX Boeing actually had the temerity to charge airlines an extra fee for the work around to their own design flaw. In the wake of the 737 Max crashes management repeatedly lied and covered up their culpability in the design flaws of the 737 Max. And after all this; all they did was fire the sitting CEO. Nothing else has changed. Unfortunately given management's intransience after this Epic disaster there will likely be more tragedies in store for this company---until shareholders fire the top execs and BOD.,-0.8966

That's really the fundamental short-term thing right now that has the market more and more spooked. When the issue was first announced, it came with all kinds of reassurances from analysts and airlines that this was expected to be a short-term nothing-burger. A month has gone by without an approved fix. There will be a fix, no doubt of that, but every day this drags on gets the market more and more concerned about how much longer it will go on. Boeing can't deliver any Max aircraft until the fix is in, and that means that spigot of revenue has been shut off for a whole month now. That doesn't spell pretty things for April reporting, so what you're seeing now is the market pricing in very low delivery numbers. And now we're a week into May without a fix, so the market is pressuring BA stock into ranges that would reflect a significant hit to May deliveries as well. Once the service bulletins are out and BA can resume Max deliveries, the stock price will turn around, but until then, you're not going to see any kind of significant improvement in price. Ultimately, the situation has created a nice buying opportunity, but if you buy now, don't be surprised if the price continues to drift downward until the electrical fix is approved by the FAA.",0.9748

First, Boeing is selling 737 MAX 7s to Southwest at razor-thin margins. Southwest expects to spend just $5.1 billion to acquire 169 aircraft from Boeing between 2021 and 2026, an average of $30 million per plane. That appears to be near -- or even below -- breakeven.Second, Southwest Airlines has stretched out its 737 MAX order book quite dramatically.

It does not make any sense. The stock is way ahead of its projected earnings. It used to be a great company that paid a dividend, but it has several hurdles to overcome before it is worth $248. Airlines are sitting on inventories of unused planes they need to get flying first. Then, they have to clean up their own balances sheets before purchasing new aircraft. That will take a couple of years. I might pay $181 for it hoping it can return a decent profit and maybe start paying a dividend in 2023. It's just not worth $248 right now.",0.9815

3271,"Fri., April 9, 2021, 12:24 p.m.Airlines pulled dozens of Boeing Max 737s out of service for inspections after the aircraft maker told them about a possible electrical problem, the latest setback for plane.Boeing said Friday that the issue affected planes used by 16 airlines, and that it recommended inspections before the planes fly again.The Max was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after two crashes killed 346 people. Regulators in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Brazil cleared the plane to resume flying in recent months after Boeing changed an automated flight-control system that played a role in the crashes.Boeing said Friday that the electrical issue was unrelated to the flight-control system. It did not say how many planes are affected or how long it will take for inspections and, if necessary, repairs.Southwest Airlines, which began flying the Max again last month, said it removed 30 of its 58 Max jets from its schedule to inspect them. Southwest spokesman Brian Parrish said the airline has not experienced any known problems related to the electrical issue.Southwest has a fleet of more than 700 Boeing 737s, most of them older models than the Max. Parish said the airline will use other planes to operate flights that had been scheduled with Max jet, and it anticipates only minimal disruption to its operation.American Airlines temporarily removed 17 of its 41 Max planes from service, according to a memo to employees. Boeing traced the issue to a production change made after the worldwide fleet of Max jets was grounded in 2019, American's chief operating officer, David Seymour, said in the memo.“We will never knowingly operate an aircraft with a known or potential issue,” Seymour said.American was the first U.S. airline to resume flying the Max, in late December.United Airlines said it temporarily grounded 16 of its 30 Max planes and will try to operate all flights with its other planes. The airline said it was in contact with Boeing and federal regulators to determine what steps are needed before the planes can return to service.Alaska Airlines said it removed all four of its Max jets from service “to allow for inspections and for work to be done.”Boeing said that it is working closely with the Federal Aviation Administration on the matter.Since the Max crashes, Boeing has made internal changes in response to accusations that it short-changed safety in pursuit of profits. Lawyers suing Boeing over the crashes seized on the latest problem with the planes.“This grounding calls into question the safety of the Max and why Boeing’s claims of a ‘changed culture’ continue to ring hollow,"" said Steven Marks, one of the lawyers representing relatives of passengers who were on board an Ethiopian Airlines Max that crashed in March 2019. “We don’t know what other issues exist.”",-0.8919

Boeing Co sent all affected carriers service bulletins late on Wednesday on how to address the production issue, which had affected 109 planes worldwide. The Federal Aviation Administration had signed off on the service bulletins, Reuters first reported late on Wednesday. The action was a relief for American carriers, which had anxiously awaited the green light to get the planes back into the air before the traditional late May start to the summer travel season. US demand for air travel has risen as the COVID-19 pandemic has waned in the United States.United spokeswoman Leslie Scott said the airline expects its “Boeing 737 MAX aircraft to return to service in the coming days as we complete our inspection process and ensure those aircraft meet our rigorous safety standards.”American Airlines said it would begin making required changes and anticipates “all affected aircraft will begin safely returning to service in the upcoming days.” Southwest Airlines, which has 32 affected planes, said it estimates the work will take two to three days per aircraft.

The five-year contract includes maintenance services for the Boeing-built CLWS units defending against hostile unmanned aerial systems in theater. Each CLWS unit is equipped with a best-in-class beam director and acquisition, tracking and pointing software to deliver precision protection. “We’re honored to continue our partnership with the Marine Corps,” said Kurt Sorenson, Boeing program manager for CLWS. “This will ensure that their systems continue to operate at the highest levels in defense of our warfighters.” Boeing recently increased the maximum beam power and reliability of the CLWS units – providing enhanced protection against larger and more numerous threats at greater range, as well as enabling them to defeat threats more quickly and efficiently.",0.9621

Unless some extraordinary game changing fundamental event were to emerge the best that can be hoped for is a decent technical rally that might get us up into the 250's before the selling would ensue again.
