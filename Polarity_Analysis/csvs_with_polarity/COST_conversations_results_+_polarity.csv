Costco, where people sample food, hang out and are so congested that people bump into one another with shopping carts and where lineups are so tight that seniors sneeze all over one another, is probably a store that is experiencing a marked slowdown in Asian traffic.I, myself, am attempting to limit my Costco visits for a bit. The daily mail in the UK reports that 14% of infected persons with coronavirus, after getting better, maintain viral loads in their system. At least 2 confirmed cases in Japan and China are online indicating that persons got sick again after getting better.

They already have a ""distribution center"" based network 5x the size of Wholefoods. If anything, COST management are the smart players who will let AMZN charge in and take the risks on redefining the consumers shopping behaviour and if and when successful, there's not doubt in my mind that Costco will follow suit and with a newfound success that can't be replicated by Bezos and Amazon.

While the selections in Costco is not much but the prices are always good. Last month, I ordered some items online from Costco. What triggered me to search the online store is I remembered the report that Costco’s online sales went up. I started to explore the online store. I checked items that I were going to purchase from Home Depot and Amazon. I purchased an air cleaner, a faucet and a garbage disposal. These items (the ones that I wanted) were usually not at the Costco stores. While Amazon has the most selections but Costco has the best price. Home Depot sometimes do have great prices when on sale.

Their customer service used to be first class, now its staffed by 3rd world losers with no English skills living in BFE. No, Amazon is going to take away consumer choices. Walgrees and others will quit offering items that Amazon sells, and pretty soon you'll go into a drug store or Safeway, they won't carry the things you always bought--cheap shampoo, dental products, hand soap, bandaids, etc. Getting it from Amazon (because its ""more convenient"") will result in inflated shipping charges and 1 week to 10 days to actually receive it.No, Amazon is not going to change things for the better for the consumer.

As the company explores reaching into the online business, they are having a very difficult time separating their 'ECOM' from their regular (in-store) warehouse business model. Their ECOM is far too slow to ramp-up because mgmt. (who I believe are excellent at what they do) just aren't accepting that Costco cannot have an online business model that follows their existing warehouse business model. There is no way around this, at present, the Amazon business model is the only one there is for online shopping. Costco needs to break from their mentality of selling (online) only those types of products that their members have come to expect in their warehouses. It's just not enough. They are severely lacking 'variety' of choice. Basically, you can find anything you need or want on Amazon but not so w/ Costco. Costco has already invested millions of dollars in ramping-up their ECOM but until they realize that online shopping just cannot be the same experience as their warehouse shopping, until they realize that they need to follow Amazon in order to compete w/ Amazon, mgmt. will remain stagnant w/ lost opportunities, revenues and profits from their ECOM operations.",0.9826

First of all, there was NO paper goods available and NO bottled water available. Why? As was reported elsewhere as well as a store employee, people panicked and bought it all OUT with unlimited purchases. leaving many people unable to get what they needed, even like me, just enough for my household near term. Of course, Costco wants to have HIGH sales volume. But as I was able to get most everything else I needed, I proceeded to the cashiers and this was about 2pm Monday. The lines were insame, it was a panic atmosphere, some lady was actually bragging that she got the last 5 cases of bottled water. I felt like teaching her a lesson but I kept my cool. However, I wasn't about to WAIT an hour to get through the line (Henderson NV) and I was so irate about it all that I just left my cart right there, walked away. FGas station was also like it was the end of the world. So, i went to WALMART. They had EVERYTHING I needed, thanks Walmart. Makes me think twice about remaining a member. What should Costco have done when people are hoarding? LIMIT purchases....there will be plenty of customers to share the products.

Walmart and Whole Foods already have many stores that offer EV charging.2) Warehousing and supply chain in Walmart and Amazon are going green with Electrification of delivery vans, Hydrogen forklifts, etc ramping up at a fast pace. Costco seems to be following old polluting energy technologies and no new plans announced yet.3) There is no clear public announcements on dollar amounts spend on green initiatives. Costco's website mentions few initiatives but seem more like a check mark and essay on procedural improvements with no clear definition on scale of projects. In contrast Amazon and Walmart have announced multiple projects in excess of billions of dollar for green initiatives.4) Costco does not have a published net zero carbon plan. Period.I request every users of Costco who believe in green and sustainable future for our kids and generations, please question, challenge and put pressure on Costco to wake up and show initiative.

CVX recent behavior of increasing the buy back amount from the failed APC / OXY bid serves as a primary example of rewarding current investors and as a ""pull / draw strategy"" for investors seeking to invest. I think the days of stock splits vs using supply / demand incentives are dwindling.

941,"All the talk of a special dividend raises interesting thoughts. I bought a few thousand shares in the mid 1990s at a single digit cost basis and have recovered all my cost basis from the dividend payments. Dividends now pay the same tax rate as capital gains. I like the dividends better than stock buybacks by the company because I can invest that money in other stocks that will now potentially produce higher returns than Costco stock would produce. Costco is now a relatively mature company so its annual rate of return is nice, but it is not a rate of return of a quality growth company. Buying back stock means that a company can't find an internal use for that money which will generate a higher return than its mature growth rate. A special dividend is a way to ""sell"" Costco stock without actually selling and using that frozen capital appreciation to redeploy into a potentially more lucrative investment. Yes, you have to pay the income tax, but hopefully using the remaining dividend money will produce returns that will compensate for the tax bill. The only way to avoid the tax on your appreciation is to die and have your heirs get a step up basis at the date of death fair market value. That is an outcome I prefer to avoid. I wish more companies would utilize special dividends rather than stock buybacks which don't always work out if the stock price falls below the buyback prices.",0.995

990,"Costco has always had a reason for avoiding forward splits but it's one subject they do not enjoy talking about. However, with the price nearing $300/shr. and a recession looming in the near future, they need to be seriously thinking about it. If they did decide to split, I don't think they can afford anything less than a 4-1. And, with their current future outlook, the time is ripe for a forward split. With a 4-1 right now they're still a $70/shr. stock. I can see that doubling to $140/shr. in less than one year. The value that provides to shareholders far exceeds any special dividend they could offer today. If you had 100 shrs. prior to the 4-1, after you would have 400/shrs. at $70/shr. a double in less than a year to $140/shr. would then produce an additional $28,000 value to your position. The strength of a forward split cannot (and should not) be under-estimated. It is an aggressive move and one that Costco is certainly in the right position to substantially increase shareholder's value.However, anything less than a 4-1 would really not be taking full advantage of the current (and future) position of this company. I certainly hope management takes a forward split into serious consideration. At this stage of the game, it's a win/win for all involved.Also, if they opt for a split and not a special dividend, they should at the very least increase their current dividend by a substantial number. For the purpose of this split analysis I have not considered the what this dividend should be.",0.998

They both have a base revenue stream from the membership revenue. Markets overreact all the time and I believe this is one of them The stock is a good buy at this price. This is a very high-quality company. I have been a member at Costco for a long time and the thought of the abandoning them to go shop at whole foods because Amazon bought them has not even crossed my mind.

We purse about 100 gallon of gas from Costco and save about $50 per month or $600 per year. This is nice to pay for our membership.

The results were fairly surprising: After comparing prices for 54 common items at Amazon, Costco, and Costco.com, researchers found that physical Costco stores generally had the lowest prices, followed by the retailer's own website and then Amazon. Overall, prices were 17% cheaper at Costco.com than they were at Amazon, and prices for national brand items were 19% cheaper at Costco.com compared to Amazon.",0.9659
1195,"Costco is indicating that some analysts and Cramer are dead wrong.Renewal rates are stagnant because of a credit card switch, and management believes these issues are short-term in nature. After all, the same thing happened in Canada, where a similar switch in fiscal 2015 caused renewal rates to drop a full percentage point. Today, renewal rates in Canada are higher than they were pre-conversion. The same thing will likely happen in the US. No red flags here.Meanwhile, the new member sign-up rate is slowing almost exclusively due to timing. Simply, the more warehouses Costco adds in new markets, the bigger its sign-up rate. The positive takeaway here is that the trend of 60,000 new members per new opening remained intact in the fourth quarter. No red flags here.Memberships per location are falling mostly due to cannibalization. The opening of a new warehouse near an existing warehouse adds to the overall membership base and adds about $80 million to $100 million of new annual sales in that market, but it also dilutes the per-location membership figures by about 10,000. That is a risk worth taking considering the incremental revenue add. Again, no red flags here.Finally, Costco is unquestionably behind in the delivery game, but it doesn’t really matter. Just look at sales and traffic trends. Comps are strongly positive and trending up. Traffic is strongly positive and trending up. Clearly, Costco hasn’t needed delivery yet to drive positive top-line trends. The value prop of an affordable and convenient all-in-one shopping destination is more than enough.Nonetheless, Costco is upping its game in the delivery market. Maybe the moves are defensive, but maybe they are just another growth opportunity for this retail behemoth. After all, it’s not like comps and earnings are falling and Costco has its back against the wall. Considering how robust the growth numbers are currently without great delivery operations, the delivery roll-out feels more like an offensive move than a defensive one",0.9982

This extra -1.5%, or #$%$75, could be due to Costco's November sales, which were only slightly below Sep & Oct, but I suspect most was attributable to those who unwittingly bought on Tue or Wed thinking they were eligible for the dividend and began dumping the stock.Does this sound reasonable?

There have been many stock market fluctuations in 30 years and I rode them out. I am an investor not a trader. Asking every day why a stock goes up or down or being concerned about a week long downtrend will drive you crazy. If you want exposure to retail stocks, then Costco is a good choice in my opinion. Traders should look at momentum stocks not this type of retail stock. Having been an investor for 60 years I made my money over time, not in a week. Sometimes you get lucky and make money fast, but that doesn't happen very often. I luckily invested in the Magellan Fund in 1965 and reinvested annual payouts.

1480,"COST is in the race to become a short-term winner and is very likely to reach $ 390 before the earnings date, according to Zacks, COST is projected to report earnings of $2.37 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 12.86%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $43.53 billion, up 11.41% from the prior-year quarter. Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $9.95 per share and revenue of $184.12 billion. These totals would mark changes of +12.43% and +10.41%, respectively, from last year.It is also worth noting that COST currently has a PEG ratio of 4.17. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate.

1708,"CostcoFor RBC Capital’s Scot Ciccarelli, Costco is a top pick in the retail space. On December 14, he maintained a Buy rating as well as a $439 price target (20% upside potential).According to Ciccarelli, “Costco just keeps doing it what it does best,” which is delivering strong sales growth and good margin performance. In its most recent quarter, the company posted comp growth of 17.1%, enabling it to generate strong leverage in fiscal Q1 2021, in the analyst’s opinion. E-commerce sales surged 86% and now account for roughly 7% of total sales.Even though U.S. comps moderated, Ciccarelli argues “this modest deceleration seemed to be driven by pull forward activity and… more aggressive Black Friday promotions starting as early as late-October from some competitors.” On top of this, gross margins reached 13.3% thanks to efficiency gains, labor productivity and significantly lower product spoilage in fresh foods.What’s more, Ciccarelli points out that Costco has the strongest buying power in the retail space because it concentrates all of its scale on a small group of SKUs, while its bigger competitors spread their buying power across millions of SKUs. Additionally, he thinks it has the lowest markup in the industry.“We believe this combination creates extremely compelling value for their members. As a result, while Costco has indeed benefitted from accelerated shopping activity as more consumer dollars are directed towards goods rather than services/experiences (what we call the Retail Lift), we believe Costco is extremely well positioned regardless of broader economic trends in 2021,” Ciccarelli opined.",0.995

2176,"(Bloomberg) -- Dairy Farmers of America Inc, the biggest U.S. dairy cooperative, is in advanced talks to acquire U.S. milk processor Dean Foods Co. But other would-be buyers could emerge.While discussions are taking place between DFA and Dean, no agreement has been reached for the purchase of all or some of the Dallas-based company’s assets, Monica Massey, executive vice president and chief of staff at DFA, said in an emailed response to questions. She didn’t speculate on prospective bidders.A deal could be a lengthy process, including an antitrust review. Any transaction would require an “extensive review of Dean Foods’ assets, thorough due diligence and other conditions, including approval from the Department of Justice and the Bankruptcy Court,” Massey said. Dean intends to file bidding procedures with the court to conduct a sale.“We have been monitoring Dean Foods’ financial performance closely since the business began showing signs of distress and have been preparing for various scenarios, including a bankruptcy filing, in order to minimize the impact to DFA,” Massey said. “Our farmer leaders and management have built our cooperative to withstand a situation like this. Our members and employees will get paid, schools will get milk, and dairy products will remain on the shelves across the country.”Dean Foods is the biggest customer of the Kansas City-based cooperative, which has around 14,500 family farmer members around the country. DFA is focused on “ensuring we have secure markets for our members’ milk,” she said.While Americans may be drinking less conventional milk, 94% of U.S. households also keep it in their refrigerators, Massey said. The dairy category as a whole remains strong, with cheese and butter at all-time consumption highs. Americans ate 2.5% more dairy in August than they did the year before, and the retail market is worth over $100 billion, she said.",0.9915

However, I am pretty sure that Costco would come out this COVID-19 in a good shape. People with cash are looking for bargains at the moment. Since Costco did not drop like the other stocks, it does not look like a bargain. Personally, I like Costco and I picked up 100 shares at closing 03/25/20. I am in for the long haul. When a stock goes down 50%, it would take a 100% upward move to break even. In this kind of market, I rather play it safe but most are looking for higher profits.

After that, you have the people who were trying to cash in, begin to sell resulting in a drop in sp. Not only that but many companies have year end drops, that's just the way it is... But just remember this... Employees have 401K options to buy/invest in the company every paycheck.

And Amazon’s impact is old news, not new, and we have observed the impact on all retail. If you’ve seen a Costco parking lot in the last 3,6,9,12or 24 months in any neighborhood—you’ve noticed that its always heavily filled with cars, even in stores where they’ve enlarged the parking areas. And if you’ve watched their membership, store sales and e-commerce numbers in the past 3,6,9,12 and 24 months—you’ve noticed that they’re doing a good job in each category. And if you’ve shopped inside a Costco anytime recently or had to return anything for any reason, you’ve seen what a positive experience it has been. Oh, and I should mention that opening stores in mainland China, where value and hands-on experience by customers are integral, should be promising.

The employees' wage increase should not scare the weak hands to start doing selling-off chaos supporting the short-sellers. Selling your long position shares only means you're taking the realized loss, it is a done deal, damage done. But if we all hold your shares, then it's only a temporary unrealized loss, be patient.

Most if not all the time, I found the price is better than most retailers and beats even Amazon. I consider myself as a long-term investor so daily fluctuation of the stock prices does not bother me. Since we cannot predict the futures we tend to study the past. Personally, I really do not trust the projected numbers that much. However, the direction or the momentum of the stock are more easily projected with some confidence. Let’s look at some of the numbers. Costco closed at $376.78 today and gained $85.29 for the year. That is a 29.26% gain. Costco gained $ 221.96 in 5 years, which works out to be a 28.67% per year. This yearly gain seems to be quite consistent. Costco has been distributing special dividends every few years and this year everyone is happy to get a $10.00 special dividend. The distribution of special dividend shows that the Company is financially sound and have excess cash that it could be paid out to the shareholders. The Beta (5Y Monthly) is 0.67. Which means that the stock is quite stable. This is not really a trading stock. There are lots of other stocks that fluctuate more, much more. If you include the dividends and the special dividends, Costco stock is gaining about 30% yearly. So, if 30% sounds good, Costco stock is a safe investment. Like so many folks have been saying about Costco. Buy on Dips is a good advice on Costco. Lastly, I wish everyone a Happy New Year and let’s all have a great 2021!",0.9977

3008,"Trump won't be badgering Costco. Costco is selling American and other products TO the Chinese collecting Yuan and repatriating that into U.S. dollars, thus lowering the trade deficit. Trump is focusing on manufacturers in China, as they sell products and components TO the U.S. which increases our trade deficit with China, as we pay U.S. dollars for those products and components that are converted into Yuan. U.S. retail stores selling in China is a plus not a minus to the U.S., so Costco and Walmart etc are not in the crosshairs of Trump, although these retailers may be in the crosshairs of Pres. Xi. Trump is trying to get China to lower Chinese tariffs on the various items Costco, GM, etc. are selling in China so their saies will rise as lower Chinese tariffs will make the products cheaper to Chinese buyers. Past efforts and tactics over decades have failed to attain results, so Trump is changing tactics through the use of tariffs.

3020,"Latest update !CostcoFor RBC Capital’s Scot Ciccarelli, Costco is a top pick in the retail space. On December 14, he maintained a Buy rating as well as a $439 price target (20% upside potential).According to Ciccarelli, “Costco just keeps doing it what it does best,” which is delivering strong sales growth and good margin performance. In its most recent quarter, the company posted comp growth of 17.1%, enabling it to generate strong leverage in fiscal Q1 2021, in the analyst’s opinion. E-commerce sales surged 86% and now account for roughly 7% of total sales.Even though U.S. comps moderated, Ciccarelli argues “this modest deceleration seemed to be driven by pull forward activity and… more aggressive Black Friday promotions starting as early as late-October from some competitors.” On top of this, gross margins reached 13.3% thanks to efficiency gains, labor productivity and significantly lower product spoilage in fresh foods.What’s more, Ciccarelli points out that Costco has the strongest buying power in the retail space because it concentrates all of its scale on a small group of SKUs, while its bigger competitors spread their buying power across millions of SKUs. Additionally, he thinks it has the lowest markup in the industry.“We believe this combination creates extremely compelling value for their members. As a result, while Costco has indeed benefitted from accelerated shopping activity as more consumer dollars are directed towards goods rather than services/experiences (what we call the Retail Lift), we believe Costco is extremely well positioned regardless of broader economic trends in 2021,” Ciccarelli opined.",0.9951

Parking spot is ridiculous to find when I go there. Nothing has changed. In fact, more sales month over month and year over year with new stores opening every quarter. The narrative is still extraordinarily bullish. And not just because of pandemic. The outbreak only gave a tail wind to the business model. Thats why we received SP divvy.

3494,"Costco reminds me of McDonald’s. McDonald’s not only profits from selling Franchises, and profiting from selling food products. It creates cash flows for the Franchisees to pay McDonald’s properties. Since McDonald’s owns the restaurants, the appreciation of the real-estates boosts the bottom line of the company. Analysts tend to compare Costco with other Big Box Retailers like Walmart. However, Costco business model is different than the others Retailers. Costco profit on products sold is very thin. It does not offer a large variety of products but it offers popular products. As a result, the products move very fast at a very large volume. The large volume helps to make up the thin margin. Costco’s profit is actually on the membership that it collects. So, when Costco sales numbers goes up, the profit that it makes is not really from the sales. It actually means that there are more new members (paying membership fees) shopping.Both companies have a niche. Costco’s business model seems to be working well. All the new Costco Store that are opening overseas are doing very well. There should be a lot of growth for Costco for expanding its footprint all over the world much like McDonald’s. While Costco is not bulletproof as it would go down if or when the market crashes but unless the world is ending, it would come back up. Personally, I am not sure I did the right thing to buy Costco. While I’ve made more than 20% from Costco, I liquidate Gold Bullion Coin to raise the cash. Gold appreciated more than 30+% after I sold. I consider Gold and Costco are both good long-term investments. Gold is more of an insurance and Costco is for growth. I have no regret buying Costco. Good luck to all the longs.",0.9975

3750,"Over the past decade, Costco has doubled their revenue, tripled free cash flow, net income and the dividend. Net margin % increased by 50%. ROA, ROE and ROIC all increased in a big way. All while keeping a pristine balance sheet, with employees treated great with highest pay in retail. And most important to shareholders, share price has increased by about 300% over the same period. A success story any way you want to look at it! Costco always trades at a premium to the market and deservedly so! However, the forward P/E of 27 is difficult to justify based on their expected growth and in this stock market environment in my opinion.

3811,"I am very pleased with my Costco shopping experience. I have taken full advantage of having an executive membership along with having and using the new CITI visa card. My wife and I send an average of about $200 a week including gas. We have, in the past have gone way above that average with big purchases of furniture, t.v.'s , vacations etc. I use the VISA everytime and pay it off each month. My executve check averages anywhere for $200 - $400 each year while my VISA check(used to be AMEX) is anywhere from $300-$900 each year depending on shopping needs. My wife and I have decided to always buy at Costco our items first, other retailers second if Costco cant meet our needs. We were a family of 4, now the kids are both in college so we have tweeked our purchases a bit. Costco is a very smart business model, their rebates on their memberships as well as their CITI Visa are outstanding. Just getting the 2% on Costco purchases is a smart way to shop. I receive 2% with executive and another 2% using the Citi Visa, then pay of the balance each month. Also 4% on gasoline at Costco as well as any other major gas retailer. Yes, you still need to be disciplined on your shopping each month, so you do not over spend, but if you manage your money well, Costco has given everybody a great way to save money on quality goods and services while giving you great cash rewards each year. Come to find out that the T.V. that I purchased also get an extended 2 additional years on top of the mfg's warranty because I charged with my Costco CITI VISA. My point about all of this is that not only has Costco been a great place to shop, its business model to the consumer has been outstanding for prices, quality, return policy, and rebates. I will receive nearly $1000 from last years shopping between the 2 checks( 1 from CITI Visa, 1 from Costco for being an executive member). And all of that doesn't even take in account all of those ""instant"" rebates off on items that I buy on a monthly basis anyway. Its just a great place to shop, and they make my shopping experience an exceptional one. Way to go Costco!! Keep up the good work!!",0.9989

Why am I saying this? Inflation. Divvy keeps rising. Stores keep opening at a break neck pace. One of the best run businesses anywhere for a B&M store let alone any store for that matter. One other thing. They are sitting at a 40X valuation. Under normal circumstances, one would run for the hills for a retail store. But COST is not your average retail store now is it? It’s middle income central for the World! It’s not going away. It pays a 2%+ divvy overall. Most sound money out there. CD? T-Bill? Nah, grab COST and take that 2% divvy for life.

(“GRAT” or the “Company”) (TSXV:GRAT) (OTC Pink:CBULF) (FRANKFURT:CB81) (WKN:A143MR) announces that it is in the process of submitting 243 Kg of high purity graphite concentrate obtained from its pilot testing program for characterization for use as anode material in Lithium Ion battery cells. The graphite will initially be put through an Air Classification process in Toronto, Ontario and from there will be sent to Dorfner Anzaplan in Germany to undergo spherical micronization and classification.Key note: Spherical graphite is a crucial ingredient to the efficient operation of lithium ion batteries, its the key component of the anode.....China is among the largest graphite producer in the world, producing around 700,000 metric tons of the metal. what people don't realize is that China uses synthetic graphite for the most. Battery is one of the few applications, where Natural and Synthetic graphite compete with each other. The battery manfucturers are shifting their focus towards natural graphite over synthetic graphite WHY? to bring down the production $cost but more importantly beacuse of environmental issues... Cue in Gratomic Inc, low cost, processed from naturally sourced graphite material, aiming to become a cleaner graphite source.....self explanatoryTo better understand things, here's an article whereby Volkswagen appoints watchdog to ensure ethical battery supply: The German carmaker has entered a “strategic partnership” with RCS Global, an agency that specialises in supply chain analysis. The company calls itself “the proven leader in data-driven responsible sourcing of natural resources” and already has partnerships with companies including Sony and Nokia.The focus of the partnership, according to VW, is on auditing its suppliers “for conformance with human rights, safe working conditions and environmental protection along the supply chain all the way back to the mines.”VW and RCS have identified 134 “sub-suppliers” and 18 mines in the carmaker’s supply chain. The majority of these have reportedly already been audited. The expanded audit operation has also allowed VW to introduce due diligence measures for each type of raw material that VW sources.Serious audit violations will lead to disqualification from VW’s supply chain. This would apply to small-scale mining operations where “child labour cannot be ruled out”, says VW.Cheers,",0.9936

So I wanted to pass along some info that should restore your confidence.First of all, bigger drops occurred in late Oct (-6.3%) and early Nov (-5.4%), but quickly recovered each time. There is no fundamental reason why it shouldn't do so again.Secondly, today's weakness was due to November's sales report (+13.4% comp) which slightly lagged Sep (+15.5%) and Oct (+14.4%). However, November still surpassed all other months in 2020 - and Aug YTD comp was only +8.4%. Since December's ER covers 1Q of FY21, it will be the best quarterly sales gain of any previous fiscal quarter.Finally, a quick review of financials shows Costco's FY20 margins (Gross Margin/Oper Inc/Pretax Inc) were about 10bp better than FY19 or FY18. With the highest-ever quarterly sales, plus improved margins, Costco will report their best earnings in history, by far!Oh, and I also noticed that Costco's increase in paid members has almost doubled in 2020 (+7.8%) from the 2 previous years (+4.5%).",0.9915

The net worth of the company would be reduced by the amount of the dividend distributed. Costco is a growth stock and buying it for dividends is a wrong move. Dividends are taxed as income and if a stock is held for more than a year, the gain would be taxed as Long Term Capital Gain. Long Term Capital Gain are taxed at a more favorable rate.

Traffic growth was 4.8% worldwide and 4.9% in the U.S. The company recently opened its first store in China, which is seen as another area where Costsco can expand. Shares were at $303.37 at 12:21 p.m. on Friday.Here's what Wall Street had to say about Costco's prospects.Cowen's Oliver Chen wrote in a note Thursday that Costco ""continues to show its retail dominance as physical and digital momentum was again on display.""He said he was encouraged by the company's ability to ""demonstrate executional excellence in an increasingly difficult operating environment.""He noted digital momentum as comparable sales grew by 23.9% in August, though the company can continue to improve things like search, check-out, returns, and work toward faster and more reliable shipping times and tracking.Costco also is in ""a relatively better position to handle dislocation from rising tariffs and will be better able to maintain relevancy with shoppers,"" he added.He has an Outperform rating with a $325 price target",0.9943

4444,"Costco raising the minimum wage to $16.00 is a very smart move. This move really does not impact the business model or earnings. First, this affects only a portion of the employees that is at the low end of the wage scale. The additional cost of wages would be easily absorbed by an adjustment of prices of goods. Even if there is a raise of prices on merchandise, Costco would still be having the cheapest prices around. I doubt customers would even notice or mind. I noticed that prices of some items do fluctuate up and down anyway. As long as I know Costco offers a Good if not the Best prices, I would keep going to shop there.The Benefits of this raise in wages are many. First, Costco got some free advertising. Costco employees are among the most helping and friendly. Local Governments all love Costco as it pulls in a lot of sale taxes. This helps when Costco wants to expand. Local Governments would band backwards to accommodate new Costco Stores to be opened in their areas. For Costco to grow and expand, a good reputation count is important.

4907,"READING MATERIAL FOR INTEREST OF SHAREHOLDERS OR LOOKING TO BE.Announcement of Periodic Review: Moody's announces completion of a periodic review of ratings of Costco Wholesale Corporation04 May 2020New York, May 04, 2020 -- Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") has completed a periodic review of the ratings of Costco Wholesale Corporation and other ratings that are associated with the same analytical unit. The review was conducted through a portfolio review in which Moody's reassessed the appropriateness of the ratings in the context of the relevant principal methodology(ies), recent developments, and a comparison of the financial and operating profile to similarly rated peers. The review did not involve a rating committee. Since 1 January 2019, Moody's practice has been to issue a press release following each periodic review to announce its completion.This publication does not announce a credit rating action and is not an indication of whether or not a credit rating action is likely in the near future. Credit ratings and outlook/review status cannot be changed in a portfolio review and hence are not impacted by this announcement. For any credit ratings referenced in this publication, please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com for the most updated credit rating action information and rating history.Key rating considerations are summarized below.Costco's credit profile (Aa3 stable) recognizes its position as the leading warehouse club operator in North America, with a destination grocery business that drives significant store traffic, an annuity-like membership model, a solidly-performing international presence, and an innovative complementary internet business. Additional drivers of the rating include Costco's world class operating capability, its excellent liquidity profile, and a financial strategy that has become more predictable and continues to be well-balanced between shareholders and debt holders. We note as evidenced by an unqualified audit opinion that as of September 1, 2019, Costco has remediated the material weakness in its internal controls that it disclosed in its 2018 Form 10K relating to general information technology controls in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology systems that support its financial reporting processes. Thus far, Costco has been able to largely weather the impact of the coronavirus as its stores are considered essential and remain open, however recent steps to implement tighter social distancing, specifically limiting the number of shoppers in stores at any one time, will have a negative impact. With its formidable liquidity and strong quantitative credit profile, Costco has the financial flexibility to successfully navigate through virtually any potential scenario",0.9972

5074,"What Costco really needs to do to re-ignite its growth engine is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for Costo (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Costo just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem.

Below what I observed and what could happen based on past numbers.On first day trading in 2021, Costco closed at $380.15. Since Costco advanced about 30% annually last year and last five years (including dividends), can we expect Costco to return the same amount this year? The combined Analyst Target in one year is $400.37. However, if we use $380.15 as the starting point, 30% advance would be $494.00+. $494.00 is a very high number. If we could advance half of that, it would still be $437.00. If I were looking for a buying point, I would go in about 10% below $380.15. That would be about $342.00. A 5% dip would be $361.00. Since my numbers are based on the first trading and the last trading days of the years, I am using $380.15 as a reference. I am long on this stock and yes, I would like to see this stock advance.

Ex-dividend means without dividend, so the ex-dividend date is the date without getting the declared dividend if you were to buy the stock. Remember, to get the lower tax rate for qualified dividends you have to hold the stock for about 6 months prior to the ex-div. date, otherwise it receives ordinary income tax rates.

Also, depending on your other income, you may pay no tax on the qualified dividends and capital gains (see the qualified div. and cap. gain worksheet in your 1040 instructions.)

There are videos showing how this is going, and it is every day as they buy as much as Costco will allow them to buy and they come back every day. Then those small business owners turn around and re-sell those items in their little stores for outrageous prices. I have been trying to buy toilet paper for 3 weeks now, and online, again, shame on Costco, NO toilet paper can be purchased for delivery at least in my near-Las Vegas zip code, per their website. I am losing faith quickly in Costco and this is enough to make me reconsider remaining a member, there seems little value in being a member when they give small business owners this advantage.
