3,"IBM Cloud is using AMD's EPYC Rome 2nd generation. $ibm isn't using $intc anymore. AMD's GPUs replacing $nvda for tight integration.""Satinder Sethi, GM of IBM Cloud infrastructure, joined me to discuss how IBM Cloud views performance and works to deliver it to its customers. Enterprises moving to cloud want higher levels of performance to support compute-intensive workloads for AI and big data, without jeopardizing security. Security is a critical component of IBM’s hybrid cloud strategy, and technologies like 2nd Gen EPYC with SEV-ES help drive new levels of security in the hybrid cloud era. IBM Cloud customers are also asking for better memory bandwidth for big data and analytics workloads. With 45% greater memory bandwidth in its class,[iii] 2nd Gen EPYC provides fantastic memory bandwidth scaling for big data and analytics workloads. Finally, the core scaling and breakthrough performance of 2nd Gen EPYC provides a superior quality of service and a higher level of performance for container workloads. IBM plans to have more to share in 2020 about its new performance offerings for clients.,https://community.amd.com/community/amd-business/blog/2019/09/18/2nd-gen-amd-epyc-continues-market-momentum-with-new-customers-and-new-performance-milestones",0.9892

The stock will never get back to where it should be in the 200-250 dollar range while the BOD plays pocket pool and allows Rometty to remain as CEO. There have been too many strategic blunders and failed market penetrations like Watson,AI, health care...the weather channel(never understood that one)... the list goes on and have cost the company and shareholders dearly. IBM lost a major cloud contract with the DOD to Amazon....Amazon( a core online shopping and entertainment services), now taking share in cloud computing. What a slap in the face to a company which used to be a technology leader far and way better than any competition. Rometty and her management team are driving the bus off a cliff and you can only hide your failures using off short cheaper labor for so long until its over. Then its to late, Rometty walks away will millions in the her pocket and leaves behind a hollowed out company, like Imelt did to ge) Every one of her management team should be FIRED and middle managers put back into the tech ranks or laid off(like they have done to so many) so the management levels get flattened.",0.9904

The Committee considered Mrs. Rometty’s efforts in ensuring a successful transition to Mr. Krishna throughout 2020 in recommending this bonus. Key accomplishments included: • Mentored CEO on Board matters and transitioned key government, client and investor relationships. • Led the Board, including continued Board refreshment with the naming of one new director. Average Board tenure is now 6 years (below S&P 500 average of 8 years). • Continued to represent IBM as a leading voice on policy matters and in forums such as the Business Round Table, Business Council, China Development Forum, Singapore Advisory Board, Business Executives for National Security, and France Tech for Good.As disclosed by the Company in December 2020, the Board approved certain arrangements in connection with Mrs. Rometty’s retirement from the Company effective December 31, 2020. The arrangements approved by the Board included a post-retirement consulting arrangement for a three-year period following her retirement for services that the Company may ask her to provide from time to time, as an independent contractor. The fee for such services would be $20,000 per day for each day she provides 4 or more hours of services, and $10,000 for each day that she provides less than four hours. To help facilitate these services, the Board also agreed to provide continued use of IBM office space and an IBM assistant during this three-year consulting arrangement.",0.9967

85,"IBMI'm well aware that IBM (NYSE:IBM) is viewed as a tech dinosaur on Wall Street, but you're going to struggle to find a more profitable tech stock valued at less than 10 times forward earnings.The downside of IBM is that the company waited far too long to switch from legacy hardware and software to the cloud. It's been paying for this lack of vision for much of the past decade, with sales declining on a fairly persistent year-over-year basis since 2012.But there's good news. Slowly but surely, IBM's cloud-based revenue as a percentage of total sales is climbing. Legacy software and services remain challenged, but total cloud revenue jumped 10% to $7.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. This works out to 37% of the company's total revenue during the quarter. The company's cloud and cognitive software profit margins nearly hit 80% in Q4 2020. That's light-years ahead of every other IBM operating segment. As cloud continues to grow into a larger percentage of IBM's sales, its operating cash flow will expand much more quickly. What's more, IBM hasn't been shy about making accretive purchases. Last year, it bought seven companies that specialize in the hybrid cloud or artificial intelligence.

NovellBy AnonymousApril 19 2010>>That leaves unspoken the answer to whether that means the jury thought it was not the intention of the APA that the copyrights transfer, but I believe that is what they meant. If they thought the copyrights were supposed to transfer, they would have answered that question with a yes. But does Judge Stewart agree?I was on the jury. In deliberations we agreed that the APA could have transferred some of the copyright rights without necessarily transferring ownership. We agreed that the written contract was the best indicator of the parties intent.It seemed clear that the intent of the deal was for Santa Cruz to develop UNIXWare, and that they would own any copyrights associated with the new development.It was also clear that Novell intended to reserve some of the copyright rights to itself, which is how it could expect direct Santa Cruz/SCO how to act with regards to the licenses that produced the revenue stream.A number of confusing points remained: Frankenburg's testimony that (C) transferred; The board minutes stating they did not; the written contract being the best indicator of the parties intent at the time of the deal; Tor's testimony that (C) were withheld; no testimony from Santa Cruz's lawyers from the APA negotiation; Santa Cruz/SCO doing business until 2003 without the (C) being an issue; Sabbath vs. Amadia in negotiation of A2 (Sabbaths' clerical error vs. Amadia not being authorized to change APA); Why A2 changed only schedule 1.1b and not 1.1a if the intent was to include copyrights; why A2 was so vague as to which rights were required for Santa Cruz to operate; why no one noticed during the review period that (C) were excluded in 1.1b.The evidence seemed to work out to a tie, and per the instructions we had to find in favor of Novell. We did agree that it was possible for Novell to assign all of the rights of copyright without transferring ownership.01:11 PM EDTIt seems SCO v. Novell was decided by stealth jurors.",0.9971

If I were a CIO I’d be spending money on WFM and moving it out of data center budgets. Services might do ok and of course 3 year or long term contracts will get counted. It’s way too risky to hold this through earnings. Buy on the other side if you like it long term and wait for signs of life in revenue growth.

Blockchain will be big and having those banks is clients should be a huge advantage.IBM also leads the world in annual patents for basically the last 20 years...............the concern is to how to monetize them properly although the Groupon lawsuit win was good.IBM is the clear leader in Quantum computing, although years away, and most of us can not even grasp what it means, it has some potential.So my net is, IBM has many things going on presently that are good, but my concern is that the management team does not effectively articulate the opportunity and thus the low multiple(also of course the slow revenue climb).Due to the incredible client base, the patent portfolio, the leader in Blockchain and Quantum computing, my dream would be for Apple to take out IBM and a mere 200M and let Apple management figure out how to turn IBM around.",0.9949

Msft managed to steer itself cleared of Kodak fate., but not Nokia. The reason is when SN took over msft, there was a sense of urgency. So when msft says it is going all in for cloud, it really went all in. Now is IBM doing the same? Every single analyst already commented what js wrong here, we all know too.

774,"ARMONK, N.Y., March 16, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced a series of new and updated capabilities for developers designed to deliver intelligent application analysis throughout the DevOps pipeline, generally available on March 19.According to an IBM internal assessment, a bank with $1B in IT spend undergoing a hybrid transformation with integrating mainframe reported 2.5x the value of a single vendor cloud approach1. However, to fully realize that potential value with low risk and high ROI, clients will need DevOps tools that can assist them to help understand application complexity – a key step when planning their cloud transformation journey.To help clients unlock the value of DevOps across the enterprise, and help reduce risk around application modernization, today IBM is announcing new IBM Wazi Analyze capabilities to help bring IBM Z into the DevOps pipeline, unlocking uniform, enterprise-wide agile delivery processes and standards with transferable skills for non-Z developers.These new capabilities are included in:IBM Application Discovery and Delivery Intelligence (ADDI) for IBM Z V6which allows developers to accelerate application development and modernization by enabling them to efficiently gain granular insight into their business-critical application estate. With the new version of Wazi Analyze, you can get updated analysis immediately after the code change is made. ADDI v6 has been engineered to improve the Assembler support by helping developers analyze the multi-level of dynamic assembler macro calls. A set of APIs are also made available to enable integration between the analysis and CI/CD pipeline.New Analyze capability in IBM Wazi Developer V1.2, a subset of ADDI, helps enable developers to discover and analyze the relationships between components of their z/OS applications and understand the impact of a potential change. Wazi Analyze runs in a containerized environment to give developers the flexibility to run it in any environment.In addition, IBM is also announcing we have completed a licensing agreement with ITP Software Systeme GmbH, Munich (ITP) to enhance DevOps for IBM Z Hybrid Cloud capabilities. This includes IBM's offerings IBM Application Discovery and Delivery Intelligence (ADDI) for IBM Z V6 and IBM Wazi Developer V1.2 and is expected to provide a strong foundation for our clients' application modernization and cloud transformation initiatives, accelerating their journey to hybrid cloud. By working with ITP, IBM will introduce advanced application analysis on IBM Z and Red Hat OpenShift, as well as be able to provide on-demand project level analysis as part of a modern DevOps pipeline when and where developers need it.""We look forward to using the new IBM Wazi Analyze web user interface as part of IBM Application Discovery and Delivery Intelligence, said Armin Kramer, Software Engineer at DATEV eG.

He cannot follow the path of his predecessor Ginni Rometty and have any chance of success.Rometty had a chance to be bold on day one by discarding the $20 EPS goal of her predecessor and instead focusing resources on the company's future. Instead of bold leadership, she chose to follow. That was a true crossroads moment. Spending the next few years pursuing that financial goal instead of investing in IBM's future led to dubious decisions that sealed IBM's fate over the next eight years. Instead of investing in the world-class workforce she inherited, she laid them off and hired overseas replacements with less education, experience, knowledge and loyalty (but, they were cheaper). It must have seemed the only way to get to the $20 EPS goal. By the time she finally gave up on the EPS goal it was no surprise to anyone. It had long been obvious the goal was unobtainable. Unfortunately by that time much damage had been done. To make matters worse, the ill-advised scorched-earth HR policies used to chase that goal had become ingrained and were considered best practices. The IBM of today is in many was a mere shell of what it once was. Even the best of employees that remain fear for their jobs.Enough about Rometty. Today is about Arvind Krishna. What I have read about him is impressive. I really hope he makes bold moves and saves this once great company. It is true that much has been lost over the last eight years but IBM is at another crossroad today. It was just a few years ago Steve Ballmer stepped down from Microsoft and was replaced by Satya Nadella. In just a few years, Nadella has done much to put Microsoft back on track. Look where they are today. I hope Arvind makes the bold moves at IBM that will deliver a similar turnaround.I know there are some who think IBM was on the right track. They like to say it takes a long time to turn around a big ship. Here are some hard numbers for them to consider. If you had invested $1,000 each in IBM, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple at the market close on 1/3/12, the day Ginni Rometty became CEO of IBM, here are the results each of those investments would have achieved over the last eight years in a huge tech bull market:IBM: $1,000 -> $967 (Down 3.3%)Microsoft: $1,000 -> $7825 (Up 682.5%)Amazon: $10,449 (Up 944.9%)Apple: $1,000 -> $6,335 (Up 533.5%)These figures include adjustment for dividends paid and are as of the market close 1/30/20.Over the last eight years, IBM has lost $96 Billion in market capitalization.Clearly, IBM has not been on the right track.Again, congratulations go to Arvind Krishna. You have a huge challenge in front of you but it is also a great opportunity. Have the courage to make bold moves. This is a huge crossroads moment for IBM.

I read that if you include figures for Red Hat, IBM’s YoY cloud growth was less this quarter than it was in the same quarter last year. Since we are told Red Hat revenues are increasing much faster than that, it appears that much of the growth has come from cannibalism of IBM’s prior cloud offerings. Those sales must have fallen off a cliff. The increase in Red Hat sales appear to be having a far greater impact on IBM’s legacy cloud sales than the sales of its cloud competitors who continue to grow faster in the cloud than IBM (even with Red Hat).

This joint venture was called ProjectMonterey. At that time, SCO dominated the market for businesses seeking UNIXbasedoperating systems to run on Intel processor-based hardware, a market IBMestimated to be worth $3 billion in 1998.IBM abandoned the partnership, however, and never released a generallyavailable operating system. Knowing that its decision to abandon the projectwould mean not getting a license to SCO’s valuable code, IBM pretended toproceed with Project Monterey to induce SCO to contribute its code to theproject’s development. IBM then took SCO’s code and used it in its own AIX forPower operating system – despite failing to meet the condition for obtaining alicense to that code.IBM’s misappropriation of code, threats, and advertisement ofimprovements in Linux grievously harmed SCO, which had offered to join forceswith IBM to share specialized technological code and expertise toward what SCOhad hoped would be a fruitful and fair partnership.See SCO brief, oral argument request at https://www.scribd.com/document/374812929/SCO-brief-oral-argument-request",0.7606

1266,"The wh prediction made by Morgan Stanley's Katie Huberty that she sees the stock going to 198 is modest PE ratio of 14.29. A 14 PE of a giant like IBM is low for a company in the lead on AI, blockchain, security, quantum computing and other new technologies and services. IBM will show a lot of cloud growth because the offer more integrated services for the cloud.Assuming IRS delivers on revenue and net income progress on their high growth sectors, the 14 PE would be far too low.I personally think, that good revenue and net income progress for 1Q2018 will justify a PE of 18 - that would bring the stock up to $250. I am merely making the point that Huberty's forward 14 PE in justifying $198 is low. We shall see the progress they are making in their next report in mid-April. These is also some speculation that IBM will increase its dividend in April. The bottom line: the stock is a strong buy at current levels. We can all agree that if IBM delivers, as expected on its current advanced and cutting edge technologies, the IBM PE can go much higher. Assuming a forward PE of something like 18 (reasonable when compared to similar growth companies), the stock can ride up easily to $250. My point here is only that $198 can",0.9956

1341,Hello IBM longs. I don't own ibm's shares but i wanted to post here about a possible big play for ibm in hybrid cloud at both enterprise and shared cloud infrastructure. Leveraging unique ibm's position in the enterprise that actually runs IT operation for big enterprises. It's nothing integrated as anyone else has with Microsoft and Amazon clouds. Ibm's $34B Redhat buy play well into this as well as AI Watson Cognitive analytics deap learning etc.This has to do with $amd GPUs and CPUs integrated in a way $nvda and $intc cannot achieve. Ibm's Power processors aren't going to make it because nvidia wasn't a good partner for ibm ripping off the price. Hence ibm has not won the supercomputer bid with Pathfinder DOE initiative. Cray has with AMD Frontier win. Intel won by default because 1. They were late in previous phase cancelling Knights GPUs and 2. DOE needs 2 wins of which ibm could make it. So I've posted a number of posts related to ibm and amd. Including ibm's general manager of cloud infrastructure saying in a video last Sep in Rome the advantages of using amd's EPYC processors including for AI and machine learning. Also recent moves of key ibm's Power processors technical and executive leadership to AMD putting in charge of amd's GPUs re to machine learning and tight CPUs and GPUs integration. Cannot happen without ibm's agreement as these people have ibm's confidential info on processors and AI related to ibm's IP. So ibm said in Sep they will reveal details of cloud computing with AMD EPYC this Q. If so i think big impact to push ibm and amd higher shares price! Please do comment if you're familiar with ibm's plans etc! Thanks.,0.9961

I believe that the spin off of “NewCo” will catalyze that.Taking a long term outlook over 2-3 years, I don’t see why IBM’s stock wouldn’t be valued at 35-40 times the earnings. However, I will be closely watching the next few quarters to see if they’re on the right track.",0.9417

As an IBM shareholder and employee I call on IBM to completely remove Ginny from IBM activity. I will share a personal story about Ginny that makes it clear she needs to go. Ginny gave her last broadcast to IBM via ""Zoom"" meeting from the family room/library of her personal home. Even her spouse made a brief appearance which validated it was her home. The background of the zoom call was broadcast from a walnut paneled library and above thee fireplace mantel was an original Audubon oil painting framed by two large antique Chinese urns like one would see in a museum. It was shocking to me that Ginny would flaunt her wealth after nearly a decade of layoffs on the backs of HER poor management decisions (Spending billions on Watson Health, Ignoring applications in the cloud when acquisitions of SaaS companies would have mattered, screwing customers by selling off software assets instead of evolving some of them into cloud based solutions and an evolutionary path for customers etc...). Ginny was indifferent to the remaining workers by flaunting her wealth to employees who had not seem a decent raise for years under her tenure. She was essentially laughing at all of us all the way to the bank! She needs to go! The culture at IBM of Queen Bees with VP and SVP titles is Ginny's legacy at IBM. The Queen Bees remain in this top heavy management structure. It is time to remove Ginny completely to break from this terrible past and cut the management bloat - start with VP and SVP MBAs with no technical degrees or experience outside IBM itself. Maybe Ginny gets to live like a queen but she should receive no further trappings from IBM as a spokesperson or otherwise. That would show Wall Street IBM has truly changed. But it has not.",0.9704

1585,"IBM Awarded Patent for Secure System Based on Blockchain2423Total views219Total sharesListen to article1:50￼NEWSTech conglomerate IBM has recently been awarded a patent for a blockchain-based secure system. The patent filing was published on U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) website Tuesday, October 2.As IMB explains in a document first filed in September 2017, the technology enables the detection of security breaches within a network by connecting all the monitors to a chain configuration, which registers all events in the network. This, in turn, might help to prevent different sorts of hacks.According to a detailed explanation provided by IBM, a monitor can be easily intruded upon in a regular system as ""none of the devices know about each other,"" and hackers can “clean up” past events to gain control.However, within a blockchain security system, a hacked monitor can be found immediately, as in such a case synchronised monitors won't have consensus. ""If the information received for a specific event or transaction differs, then one monitor may have been compromised,"" the filing explains.The use of blockchain technology in monitor systems will therefore help create “a less vulnerable” network and provide more security, IMB states.IBM shares first place globally with Chinese e-commerce corporation Alibaba in terms of blockchain-related patents filed. As a per recent report by intellectual property outlet iPR Daily, Alibaba has registered 90 patents, while IBM follows behind with as many as 89 patents. For instance, in mid-September, IBM filed another blockchain patent in the security area. As Cointelegraph wrote, the patent application was related to privacy rules for drones in case of high risks.Later in September, IBM was awarded a patent for the autonomous self-servicing of networked devices that form part of its Autonomous Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Telemetry (ADEPT) environment.",0.9977

IBM is only months away from becoming a dividend aristocrat. 25 years of straight dividend increases2. Even if free cash flow drops THERE IS NO WAY that the BOD will break this streak3. Thus the dividend is safe... and its currently yielding more than 6%4. IBM does not make (much) stuff … thus it has no supply chain and factory problems5. 80% of IBM's staff already, / or is fully capable of working from remote so there are no ""closures""6. The whole world is learning from corona that moving ""online"" and ""Remote"" is functional7. as such (with all the new working REMOTE companies) the whole ""cloud"" IT landscape will grow dramatically as this corona issue is resolved8. IBM will resultantly capture a portion of this post corona business - as its deeply supported INSTITUTIONAL sized clients up their game and their needs for support from IBM. 9. with all the millennials, and GIG economy, and service industry employees, - circling the unemployment offices like buzzards.... they will not be buying their ""fashionable"" new Iphones - and APPLE will fall hard as it hugely misses earnings for several quarters straight..- those investors will be looking for other post corona economy safer stocks - and historically IBM has been one of those companies that seems to get ""held"" during rough times. 10.

With all these divestment IBM revenue has declined year to year for 9 years. It also worth noting that during same period there has been significant number of companies that has been purchased at great deal of costs to share holders. Revenue from new companies has not filled the gap in revenue shortfalls. There are two points that has become clear. IBM senior executives inability to run existing business units effectively and their first inclination is to say let us get out of this business. The second point is the failure of senior management to effectively integrate technology from new companies with existing IBM technologies to develop market winning customer solutions. AI is promising new IT filed. Better approach would be to find out where is the technical deficiencies and hire new expertise or buy technology to address the problem. Most of blame for failure of Watson can be attributed to Rometty’s management: talk big and deliver little. Now IBM current CEO resorts to standard IBM practice and wants to sell it off. It is not hard to see in a few years after failing to capture significant market share in cloud, he will declare IBM needs to get out of the cloud business and focus on quantum computing. IBM BOD bears the blame for allowing incompetent COE to stay on the job and destroy shareholders value for long term IBM investors.

2154,"RemoteMyApp adopts IBM Cloud to scale multi-platform gaming service1:28 PM ET, 03/21/2019 - PR NewswireIBM Cloud provides Vortex platform with scalability and strong performance for online gamers around the world on almost any deviceARMONK, N.Y., March 21, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that Polish startup RemoteMyApp will adopt IBM Cloud for increasing global reach and scaling of its Vortex gaming platform.Vortex allows users to play games anywhere in the world on almost any device - smartphone, tablet, or smart TV –via the application, without downloading the game. As the platform has grown in usage and expanded to new markets such as Latin America and South East Asia, Vortex needed to scale its services, updates, and functionality to meet growing demand from players. Vortex turned to IBM Cloud to provide the global scale needed to provide a low latency gaming experience no matter where players are or what device they are using.IBM Cloud positions the Vortex platform to provide high performance computing service with GPU graphics cards. Using powerful servers hosted in several of the nearly 60 IBM Data Centers around the world, Vortex can handle an infinite number of players from all continents without any loss in efficiency or quality of services and with the lowest possible latency. With a game library available in the cloud, gamers will even play games on older devices because all of the processing, including graphics, has been transferred to the cloud.The growth of online gaming platforms turning to cloud is the result of two factors –a constant growth in the number of players and the increasing popularity of mobile devices. The Vortex deployment is just one of a handful of gaming industry clients like EA's Firemonkeys, Exit Games, and LiquidSky that recently adopted the IBM Cloud to deliver a gaming experience that is globally scalable and allows for quick product updates in a competitive market.""The gaming market is currently the fastest growing entertainment sector, and the sale of video games alone generates almost three times more revenue than the global film industry,"" said Andreas Hestbeck, CEO at RemoteMyApp. ""Our users live almost everywhere in the world and the subscriptions are growing every day - which is why we need IBM Cloud for reliable, global scalability.""""RemoteMyApp chose IBM Cloud as a collaborator in their digital transformation because we are dedicated to meeting customers where they are on their cloud journey whether they're a startup or have decades of legacy systems and need a hybrid cloud solution,"" said Przemyslaw Galinski, IBM Cloud Platform Sales Leader Poland and Baltics. ""We look forward to providing RemoteMyApp with the scale they need as they mature in this competitive, growing market.""Since its launch in 2017, Vortex has gained in popularity among cloud gaming platforms with more than 6 million users. With a monthly subscription model, players are granted 100 hours of gameplay and access to more than 100 games, including new releases. Unlike many other streaming platforms, Vortex does not require installing anything other than the application to access the library and choose a game.About RemoteMyAppVortex platform is a flagship service in the RemoteMyApp portfolio. Another service, Remotr, allows users to stream games installed on home PCs to any other device with Android and iOS, such as a smartphone, tablet or smart TV.

2240,"IBM threw a curve ball. I am retired and needed some income so I increased my shares in T and added IBM. IBM is no longer the company it used to be. The business model is changing (not going into details as most know this already). I thought this is a good stock as the dividend is relatively high and IBM looks like it would continue to provide me a steady income with a growth potential. Honestly, when the stock goes up, it just makes me feel good but it really does not matter. As long as I need to hold the stock to get the dividend, these are paper gain only. This news on the 2nm chip is a game changer. The current most advance chip in the market is 5 nm. This is a leapfrog advance. The benefit is huge. The smaller wiring inside a chip would yield faster speed as the distance for the electrons to move is shorter. The wiring is smaller and it draws less power. The mobile device would last longer between charges. Chips are made from Crystal wafers. The yield on smaller chips would increase from the same size wafer. IBM’s new 2nm chip would beat all existing chips and the next chips that are schedule to be released by other manufactures. IBM could either contract manufactures to make this new 2 nm chip or licensed this technology. Either way you cut it, this is going to be a new revenue stream. I am lucky that I added IBM to my portfolio. I am not selling even with this gain as there is no other stock that has a good potential and pays me a decent dividend.

I read about the the billions of dollars of company revenue spent each year buying back stock only to see it presented at no cost to these select managers who in turn then sell it back into the market and bank millions upon millions of dollars. None of these managers, from a financial standpoint, need these zero cost stock grants and would do better at this point to take that company equity and put it into something that might actually grow the company. IBM is world renowned for the thousands of patents that emanate from its research facilities around the world each year, yet when was the last time an IBM patent has truly shaken the industry and grown the company. Perhaps taking some of the millions of dollars in zero cost stock grants going to the managers of this under performing company and using those millions to do a more critical evaluation of the thousands of yearly patents grants might identify a patent likely to evolve into that one blockbuster patent IBM so sorely needs to grow the company and even reward poor stockholders like myself who have kept the faith and kept IBM shares in their portfolio.",0.9944

2641,"SERIOUS THOUGHTS - what is common between $ibm $intc and $nvda vs AMD's future ?This is not intended to bash any of the respective long investors in those companies. Just hopefully to start an open mind thought provoking process in a hope all will do whatever is best for them, with my best wishes for such!Let's start with IBM, recent move to spinoff a third of itself into a new company so to focus better on cloud. What happened? Well they have failed growing cloud in past year and realized that they need transform their business completely. Obviously they couldn't find a buyer to take such segment of their revenues which is substential so they split it. I'll not discuss the difficulties and prospects of such it's beyond the scope of this post. But ibm bought Redhat for $34B, and place it at the center of its future of cloud. Obviously cannot beat cloud kings Amazon and Microsoft not even Google. So they're talking about hybrid using OpenShift from Redhat. To me it means they hope Redhat business can scale to replace all future revenues of IBM. All legacy will be sold or spinoff. So more is coming possibly but...can that really happen ? I doubt it but they have no choice failing to gain cloud traction years ago, so now they need think about smaller operation. It's like HP split into HPE and Compaq based consumers HP.If you understand that you can see both Intel and nVidia looking for a different business. We already know Intel clearly stated they don't want to be mostly CPUs focused. They try buying all kind of companies to do something else. Why? They realized after their delays they cannot beat AMD. Too late. Trying GPUs. .won't work. .trying Altera FPGAs. ..trying Mobileye etc. Just like ibm focus on Redhat expansion intel tries to find alternatives. It's yet to be seen what business will emerge but no CPUs which could lead to selling all fabs, just like ibm has done as it moves to other business. Now the best is last. What is nVidia doing? I know you cannot agree all with me. But as I've posted in another post, both gaming and datacenters GPUs are in danger. Not winning any supercomputers in the US and abroad is a clear red flag for once dominant company. So nVidia trying to find completely different businesses. Mellanox isn't enough as the network gets integrated into the chips. See Cray own network and infinity fabric possible expansion with other emerging standards like Gen-Z etc. ARM licensing business is to be nVidia's Redhat. They can shift to it all, adding better GPUs IP but no longer make discrete GPUs as AMD taking over this market as I've explained. There you have it. My thinking. It's clear where AMD is going. What isn't clear is if Intel and nVidia and IBM can find their new niche or a major new revenues segment. HPE bought Cray - expanding HPC as a mainstream product to also help its datacenters offering. AMD is to gain the whole market from Intel and nVidia in GPU's and CPUs. That's my thinking with the obvious impact to come.Good luck all!",0.9987

2715,"When the dividend goes poof - so will the share price.. Be sure to do ALL of your analysis on IBM WITHOUT the dividend....... What happens to the dividend when IBM divests the 19 billion dollar GTS business into ""NewCo"" - expected to happen before the end of this year (its tick tick tick ticking soon).. Keep in mind that anyone still holding here will then magically have shares of both companies.- will the current dividend be split between the two publicly traded entities - with each paying what they believe to be appropriate??- will NewCo even have a dividend ?? - most new age tech companies don't pay one.- although ""NewCo"" will effectively be the old portion of IBM - (the side without Redhat and basically the ""cancer"" side that IBM is attempting to excise like a gangrenous limb )-Will ( the remaining half of ) IBM then just cut its dividend - as the remains of IBM will be only half of the cash machine it was before the split ??-Will (the remaining half of) IBM (-which will basically be RedHat) eliminate the dividend - as RedHat did not have one- will IBM automatically then lose its Dividend Aristocrat status ?? (A status which is also driving the current price). It would be a great time for the company (but not for the investors) to simply use this opportunity to get out from under paying billions in dividends. There is NO DOUBT that the current dividend and ratios are a part of what is holding up the current share price... A historic Dividend just south of 6%, is a big deal, and there are a TON of people and funds that hold IBM for that ratio. So what happens if the dividend goes away or is decreased (across both OldCo & NewCo) and then all of the funds and holders that hold IBM for ""income"" bail out?? .. in search of safer and better yield dividends. No doubt once the initial dust settles - the overall dividend(s) will be less and thus the volume will be less. Setting aside corporate profits, strategy, management, directions of BOTH future companies..... I seriously believe the Dividend is in serious jeopardy here..... I am holding a fistful of shares until the split hoping that for one or the other company that there will be a run up on the excitement.... but I will not hold both (or either) of these companies for very long after the split - as the sum of the two parts then at that bleeding point in time will be less than the current whole - And we all know that the current ""whole"" has been a disgrace for the entire Ginny time frame.",0.9536
2716,"Here is an excerpt from an article from Seeking Alpha from earlier today. Speaks volumes about the two problems driving the stagnation.

During her tenure, the stock has declined by 27% while she has pocketed more than $100 million in salary. A look at Glassdoor shows that only 73% of her staff approved of her job. The CEOs of Microsoft, Salesforce, Google, Cisco, and Intel have an approval rating of 97%, 96%, 92%, 93%, and 88% respectively. This tells you that all is not well with her.Ginni is not the only problem. The board of directors is made up of a team that has very little background in technology. It is made up of people from companies like UPS, Emerson Electric, Johnson & Johnson, and Dow. At a time when the computing industry is seeing rapid change, an underperforming company like IBM should at least have veteran tech executives on the board.""",0.9446

2882,"With everything from cars, to trucks, to even airplanes going electric, the demand for batteries is going to continue to skyrocket in the coming years—but the availability of the materials currently used to make them is limited. So scientists at IBM Research have developed a new battery whose unique ingredients can be extracted from seawater instead of mining.The problems with the design of current battery technologies like lithium-ion are well known, we just tend to turn a blind eye when it means our smartphones can run for a full day without a charge. In addition to lithium, they require heavy metals like cobalt, manganese, and nickel which come from giant mines that present hazards to the environment, and often to those doing the actual mining. These metals are also a finite resource, and as more and more devices and vehicles switch to battery power, their availability is going to decrease at a staggering pace.As a potential solution, scientists at IBM Research’s Battery Lab came up with a new design that replaces the need for cobalt and nickel in the cathode, and also uses a new liquid electrolyte (the material in a battery that helps ions move from one end to the other) with a high flash point. The combination of the new cathode and the electrolyte materials was also found to limit the creation of lithium dendrites which are spiky structures that often develop in lithium-ion batteries that can lead to short circuits. So not only would this new battery have less of an impact on the environment to manufacture, but it would also be considerably safer to use, with a drastically reduced risk of fire or explosions.This Is Why You Should Take Lithium-Ion Battery Fires Very, Very SeriouslyBack in June, after installing a new lithium-ion battery into its ape-inspired RoboSimian and…Read moreBut the benefits of IBM Research’s design don’t stop there. The researchers believe the new battery would have a larger capacity than existing lithium-ion batteries, could potentially charge to about 80 percent of its full capacity in just five minutes, would be more energy-efficient, and, on top of it all, it would be cheaper to manufacture which in turn means they could help reduce the cost of gadgets and electric vehicles. These results are estimations based on how the battery has performed in the lab so far, but IBM Research is teaming up with companies like Mercedes-Benz Research and Development to further explore this technology, so it will be quite a few years before you’re able to feel a little less guilty about your smartphone addiction.",0.9952

Even if IBM just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem.

""The company (IBM) we think, is still engaging in basically accounting high jinx. And it's hiding all in plain sight if you take a look at their numbers."" Jim added that IBM was supposed to earn $9 pro forma in 2020 but the actual number was just $6. He thinks that it's going to be only $5 dollars this year and $4 in 2022. ""IBM increasingly has engaged in lots of games to do this and the latest one is they're going to do a spin-off and now take a lot of charges, that they're going to ask you to add back as part of the adjusted earnings so that the actual gap earnings don't look so bad"". Jim Chanos said that IBM tried to do this thing about 5 years ago and they can only do this sort of 'illusion' for a short period of time. For him, we're in a period where IBM will sooner or later announce that ""we're not really earning $9, $12 or $13. We're actually earning $6, $5 and $4. And it's going to be the next reset.""",0.9835

IBM's current Q System One machine has 20 qubits.""This effort is poised to be a major catalyst for Europe's innovation landscape and research capabilities,"" Martin Jetter, senior vice president and chairman of IBM Europe, said in a statement.Developing viable quantum computers has proved to be hugely challenging because they rely on superconductivity that can only be achieved in a controlled environment in which temperatures are held close to absolute zero.Any instability in the qubits can lead to ""noise"" that disrupts computing.The IBM Q System One, launched in January, has so far been deployed primarily in a research setting but the company - which has branched into cloud computing and artificial intelligence - hopes to turn it into a commercial proposition.Researchers will be able to access the quantum computer via the IBM cloud, with potential tasks ranging from mapping complex molecular structures and chemical reactions to making artificial intelligence more powerful.""This partnership is a landmark quantum computing initiative and a crucial step forward for German research institutions as well as businesses of all sizes in our country,"" said Professor Reimund Neugebauer, President of Fraunhofer Gesellschaft.Merkel's government last year said it would make available 3 billion euros to sponsor the research and development of artificial intelligence by 2025 as it seeks to regain ground in cutting-edge research",0.9945

I'm sure expanded capacity was ordered as ibm had promised availability in Q1. But April 1st extra time because of corona requires more capacity so they got more from amd and made sure all is available in place to prevent shortages!

IBM is to announce in Q1. This is more than just instances. It's hybrid cloud with enterprises. This explains why ibm's key technical leadership on such moved to AMD and are in charge of stuff related to the GPUs! Impact to $nvda and $intc is clear. Because of the tight integration between CPUs and GPUs amd is creating, enterprise customers will move to amd for both. Just like why cray Frontier supercomputer uses both GPUs and CPUs as I've posted Lisa Su explained because of such integration. This could benefit ibm too of course as ibm runs a lot of IT at big enterprises, it's at a position to replace legacy intel and nVidia servers with new amd's design in addition to the ibm's cloud side!

3351,"For those of you who believe IBM is on the right track and think it's a great place to invest your money, here is a little analysis that may make you rethink your position. The following is a comparison of the market capitalization of IBM, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple since IBM's current CEO took over at the start of 2012. I chose market cap because it takes out some of the distortion caused by the financial engineering of buybacks. (The raw data behind the figures were obtained from stockrow.com. Please feel free to check my numbers and report any errors you find here).When Ginni Rometty took over as CEO, Microsoft was about 10% bigger than IBM in terms of market cap. Microsoft is now more than 500% bigger.Amazon was more than 60% smaller than IBM in Market cap (only about 38% of IBM's size). It's now more than 550% bigger than IBM.Apple was a little more than 80% bigger. It's now over 600% bigger.Most of you reading this have jobs where your where your performance is rated against expectations. What do you think would happen to you if you were responsible for performance like what is described above? IBM's market cap has dropped from about $219B at the start of 2012 to roughly $134B today. That is a loss of $85 billion dollars. That's a lot of money and it happened during a period where the overall market went up substantially.Many of you probably think I'm anti-IBM. I'm not. I'm actually a fan of the company and I am aware of its long history. That is why I am critical of leadership that has delivered the results described above while executing a transition that as far as I can tell they have never committed to an end date for. As stockholders of IBM, this is what you're getting for your money. Are you really happy with this performance?",0.9841

For those of us who had invested in msft and and earlier would be able to attest iBM can even go to $1000. Heck I would even say it should have been there to begin with. It long time past that the longs of IBM should deserve something. Msft has grown 8 times and AMD has grown 50 times the last couple of years. To grow us simple, focus on growing IBM, not social matters, meaningless R and D only for it to be un monetized and outdated.

3431,IBM's ER today after closing. Remember IBM said their cloud going with AMD's EPYC Rome and details of this to be revealed in 1Q2020. Maybe today at the call? Also if IBM is to do bigger AI for corporate business clients for their Hybrid Cloud strategy which they bought RedHat for a record $34B they NEED the GPUs to accelerate such Watson AI workloads. But nVidia's is charging a huge price for every datacenter GPU IBM is forced to buy. If it's using Power processors it was using propiatery nVidia's NVLink unfortunately embedded in Power processors. For x86 they use PCIe gen 3. But it kills competitive pricing as Power cannot be priced higher than an Intel x86 and now a way cheaper EPYC Rome kills it. No choice but to dump nVidia and partner with AMD in my view. $ibm shareholders will be smart to hedge buying AMD shares and sell $nvda ahead of IBM's ER today.https://www.barrons.com/articles/ibm-reports-earnings-tuesday-heres-what-you-need-to-know-51579467600,0.9766

Defense companies faced with shrinking revenue but still reliable base revenue. If we look at LMT, GD, NOC their stock price had huge gains. They shrunk number of shares and EPS dramatically increased. I can see some similarities and how IBM could have followed their example. IBM generates about $13B free cash with market cap of about $120B. Argument can be made that shares price is significantly under valued. With only 900 million shares outstanding. Taking shares down to below 500 million would not be difficult. Some of the revenue decline is due to strengthening value of dollar and divestment of pc business. Core IBM business is capable of generating sustainable revenue and profit for foreseeable future. So financially strong company with high stock price would have happy stock holders and ability to grow the business from this base.

To help facilitate these services, the Board also agreed to provide continued use of IBM office space and an IBM assistant during this three year consulting arrangement.”IBM's CEO and outgoing exec chairman take home $38m in total for 2020 despite revenue shrinking by billionsPaul Kunert Wed 17 Mar 2021 // 10:15 UTCFinancial goals missed but Big Blue's execs were all winners anywayIBM CEO Arvind Krishna and ex-exec-chairwoman Ginny Rometty were collectively awarded more than $38m in compensation for their services in fiscal 2020, a year in which Big Blue's revenues shrank and operating profit more than halved.According to the 2021 Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement, Krishna, who was elevated to top dog in April last year, made $17.009m. This included $1.353m in salary, $13.159m in stock awards, $2.181m in a non-equity incentive plan, $42,806 in pension and $274,146 in other compensation. He was confirmed as chairman months ago from 1 January when Rometty retired.As for the outgoing exec, she [Ginny Rometty] was awarded a total of $21.062m: $1.6m salary, $12.728m in stock options, $4.25m in non-equity incentive plan, $100,604 for a change of pension retention plan value, $1.5m for change in value, and $883,314 for all other compensation.

To help facilitate these services, the Board also agreed to provide continued use of IBM office space and an IBM assistant during this three year consulting arrangement.IBM's payouts for execs have various scoring metrics: 80 per cent of the award was based on meeting non-GAAP metrics including operating income and operating cash flow; and 20 per cent of the weighting was based on group revenues.The company itself reported a 4.5 per cent decline in turnover to $73.620bn for its fiscal 2020, which ran from January to December. The target had been $80bn. Similarly, the non-GAAP net profit target was $10.7bn but it came in at $7.8bn. The operating cash flow metric of $14.8bn also came up short at $13.8bn.Others in the senior management team also had a prosperous year: CFO and senior veep Jim Kavanaugh was awarded $9.746m, up from $7.14m; exec veep John Kelly got $8.456m versus $7.724m in 2019; and senior veep and general counsel Michelle Browdy was awarded $6.274m, up from $5.588m. The person given the biggest pay award was Jim Whitehurst, who ran Red Hat prior to its purchase by IBM for $34bn. He was subsequently appointed to the role of IBM president in 2020. His compensation package came in at $27.178m. This included $1.173m in salary; $22.4m in stock awards; $1.455m in a non-equity incentive plan; and $130,562 for all other compensation.Whitehurst will be paid up to $6m in a cash retention payment, the first of which landed in July 2020 – the first anniversary of IBM's buy of Red Hat. The second and third payments are due in July this year and next respectively, dependent on meeting criteria, including hitting financial targets.In 2018 IBM was criticised by some on Wall Street for its execs not being financially rewarded to drive the top line. Rather it incentivised leaders to generate top-line growth with Strategic Imperatives (which include cloud, social, security and data).Total revenues at IBM peaked in 2011 at $106.93bn in Rometty's first year at the top and have fallen ever since.Last year IBM reintroduced a total revenue component to comprise 20 per cent of execs' pay metrics. For 2021 it has been increased further to account for 50 per cent of the scoring that determines leaders' annual incentive pay and 40 per cent for the performance share unit. Also new is the Diversity Modifier, intended to motivate execs to ensure diversity in the workforce.It may come as no surprise to cynics that IBM is changing the compensation plan as it prepares to spin off the Global Technology Services division into a separately traded public company.

The executives of those companies played golf and dined on IBM's dime at the IBM Golf and Country Club. Today is different.

3822,"CSCO planning aggressive buyback if tax reform passesBackground on companies with high tax reform repatriation potential https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/26/goldman-these-companies-are-headed-for-a-big-tax-break-on-overseas-cash.html Related info from Cisco earnings call on 15 Nov 2017 James Faucette -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thanks very much. I wanted to ask a question on capital structure. Can you give us an idea of what your preferences and priorities will be in capital structure in terms of buybacks and acquisitions, etc. if the proposed new tax changes pass versus if that change in tax law gets derailed? I'm particularly curious as to how you're thinking about the pacing of acquisitions versus buybacks, etc. Thank you. Kelly Kramer -- Chief Financial Officer I'll take that one. What I'd say is in terms of acquisitions, the tax policy isn't impacting us either way because we are lucky to have a great cash flow and access to capital. So, it hasn't been stopping us from anything from an acquisition perspective and it won't. So, that will continue. I would say we're definitely encouraged by the progress that's going on, on the tax reform. So, like we said in the past, when that happens and if we get a repatriation which both plans currently have, we're going to continue like we have, growing or dividend with our earnings growth and where we have opportunity is really to get much more aggressive than we have been on the share buyback and of course we want to make sure we continue to have enough firepower to continue to be able to do the right acquisitions to help position Cisco right for the long term. https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2017/11/16/cisco-systems-csco-q1-2018-earnings-conference-cal.aspx",0.994

Perhaps IBM will have to consistently perform for at least 2-3 quarters to give investors the confidence that it is on the right track. The silver lining is that the margins appear to be improving.

The author is a technology guy, former AMD's employee. Vast vision and products roadmap, margins, growth and earnings modeling too. This is the ""best is yet to come"" Lisa Su has promised. I implore you to think about it and consider your position in AMD...!Yesterday's news on AMD winning the El Captain supercomputer was just the begining. Not only $nvda and $intc didn't win. The curious news lack mentioning that $ibm lost this too as IBM were working with nVidia and Power processors used NVLink what AMD will have with Infinity Fabric connection between CPUs and GPUs. The loss of IBM pretty much seals AMD's position as the leader not just for supercomputing one of, but Datacenters and Cloud and Enterprise IT!We've seen IBM's technical leadership suddenly hired by AMD. We have heard IBM last September endorsement of EPYC Rome for cloud computing citing Artificial Intelligence computations. We've just seen HPE / Cray will work with AMD for AI computations for the El Captain. These aren't just random signs. It's the future and the best is yet to come future! Displacing IBM and nVidia out of supercomputing win at the DOE is huge. El Capitan is stated to work as a cloud. Yes HPC computations but cloud management that ports to datacenters cloud. There's $100m additional investment to develop AMD's open source software for AI. This is huge but just a hint to much more to be announced today!Consider your AMD's position carefully. ..you may not have another chance after today....Read the 2017 Financial Analyst Day article.

In the future, the Cloud Private for Data will run on all clouds, as well as be available in industry-specific solutions, for financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, and more.Commenting on the news, Christian Rodatus, CEO of IBM business partner Datameer, said that ""two of the biggest challenges for Data scientists is cleansing and shaping data, and operationalizing their insights to deliver value to business.

The cohesive set of capabilities is designed to help Cloud Private clients quickly discover insights from their core business data, while keeping that data in a protected, controlled environment.

4250,"Dear Aravind, Jim,Congratulations to both of you. Here is a quick 2020 priority list for you. 1. R&D - Review the IBM patents portfolio and hire a team to capitalize them one by one. Not one patent should be wasted and sitting in some digital documents. This is easy money, annuity. 2. Hybrid Cloud - Integrate every product of IBM with AWS and Azure. Remember that customers will switch to IBM if they see a clear path and flexibility. Set an objective of growing at 25% per year. There is truly no competition and no workforce in the world can integrate as well as IBM’s. Develop a strong link between Mainframe and RedHat portfolio so that the vertical power of mainframe can be leveraged with the horizontal power of RedHat. You will be making the most powerful Cloud in the world. 3. AI and Quantum Computing - Please invest with startups in mind. Develop a culture of partnering with the VCs and private equity rather than potential customers. Your sales force is not smart and driven as well as the entrepreneurs of the world.4. The world is flat - Develop SVPs in Asia Middle East and Latin America directly reporting to you. You must pay highest salaries and acquire the highest technological or managerial talents. Please fire executives who are not performing immediately. 5. Government business - Can’t you see that the US government is printing trillions along with all other countries. How come you are not the number one technology provider across every government in the world. There is no way Amazon or Microsoft can even place their foot in the door if you put your focus in every mission critical program. 6. Elon Musk - Please beg him or people like him to join the Board. They can teach you about the future more than the current old school board members. Just one joint venture with him will give you a moonshot program you never imagined. 7. Healthcare - Easy money and the highest margins. Please partner with them on every mission critical R&D programs. Commercialize the mainframe technology and the cloud foot print to enable faster and productive research.You will make Billions in working with them. Hope this helps!

4252,"I worked for IBM doing consulting work about 20 years ago, primarily mainframe work which would be legacy work today. At that time much of the work involved interfacing the emerging PC's to tap into the data held on the mainframes, as well as allowing the mainframes to access data which was more and more being picked up by PC's.I was impressed with the reliability of the mainframes and the excellent documentation.Somebody at some time inthe past had laid out a methodology for testing and implementing which was excellent. However, that was at a time where with foresight you could map out where you were and where you wanted to get to.Today things move so fast that mapping out process doesn't work out so well, and in the computer field they use what is called AGILE planning, where you have a much looser goal and continually monitor and adapt your strategies. At the time there products were first rate. At this point i am not an insider, but remain extremely impressed by their AI and Watson.there are 2 basic kinds of AI, one uses simulated neural networks that learn in the same way the brain does, and one uses a more programmed way of understanding. Of course they can be combined to some degree.the thing is I have seen Watson perform on Jeopardy. AS ken Jennings said 'i for one welcome our new overllords'.I have not been as impressed by either Microsofts AI software or Googles. They may be out there doing fantastic things, but i personally haven't seen it. Amazons software as used with their Alexa box kind of sucks by comparison to Watson.I've worked with Microsoft products and from a programmers point of view, they are kind of chaotic and by compelling updates all the time make it very difficult for American programmers to make a decent go of it as professionals.it is a field where you are constantly scrambling to keep up. it is more practical for 3rd world countries where there is a reasonably educated and able population to fill the programming needs. Americans if smart would go into some other line of work. While i used to resent the way IBM prevented innovation on mainframes so as to maintain a monopoly, there was some value in continuity.On balance i think ibm has an advantage in the AI field, and would like to learn more about the distinguishing features of the different AI competitors.Combining those tools with genes, green revolution is where the future lies.",0.9971
