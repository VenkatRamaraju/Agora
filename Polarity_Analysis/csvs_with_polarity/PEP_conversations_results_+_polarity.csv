0,I work for the company and the average raise for salaried employees was less than 2%. Most got 1% and a few 1.5%. This has been going on for several years and when you ask the managers why the raise levels are so low they always say the company has no money. The CEO gets 13% and she does not produce anything. That is a slap in the face to those who work hard to make the product so this company can prosper. What a load of #$%$!,0.8363

While the company heavily supported the Clinton Global Initiative, this week the CEO was in the close quarters with Trump.

83,"I still have several concerns that I wish PepsiCo executives would address regarding North America and the future of their company and stock:- How do they plan to address declining sales volume in key segments (e.g. PBNA), particularly outside of their relatively new products in Bubly and Lifewtr, where sales are weak?- Are the Bubly and Lifewtr products at risk? For instance, Lifewtr doesn’t seem to be as successful as peer products in the segment, and I wonder if it is at risk of de-listing. Same concern with Bubly. It seems like they are starting off like Mountain Dew Kickstart (good growth in the first couple years), which launched several years ago to similar performance, but stalled, fell off, and failed.- How do they plan to grow outside of acquisitions such as Muscle Milk and smaller players?- What is their plan to grow revenue/profit after they cycle over recent price increases? Surely, they cannot take price up by large levels every year and soon the gains from price increases will wear off.- How wise are their social justice campaigning? Are they alienating their core customers in the Midwest and South by taking up these positions?",0.9788

Conclusion: Even though PEP's shares were ""cheaper"" after it split its shares, the alleged increase in retail demand for shares was trumped by others selling shares?There is something much more powerful that impacts a company's valuation, than simply whether it has X shares outstanding or 2X shares outstanding: FUNDAMENTALS!If a company does well, it's earnings will increase (over time) and its valuation will increase (share price).It's a pretty straight forward concept, assuming one can check their EMOTIONS at the door.Cheers!",0.995

The price performance of the share depends on the state of the market and the fundamentals of the company once the transients settle down,"" Gupta added.”Market experts believe that investors should look at the fundamentals of the company before taking a position immediately after a stock split. Avinash Nahata, head-fundamental desk, Aditya Birla Money says, ""Stock-splits have a neutral affect on the price of a stock.""”“Udit Mitra, director, research, MAPE Securities, says, ""If the fundamentals of a company remains same, there will be no impact on the value of your investment, but on the trading floor, as more floating shares are available for trading you expect market forces to determine the true price with a bigger volume. Hence, if the fundamentals are good, stock will trade up and vice versa.""”“However, the key parameter to be evaluated while investing in a company which has gone for a stock split is the valuations of the company or the underlying fundamentals.”“""It was trading at 32 times one year forward price-to-earning-ratio (P/E). The fundamentals of the company also deteriorated. Hence after the split, the stock underperformed,"" Thakkar added.

In todays world a split does not make sense......it does not add any additional value, your position will not be worth more, you will not see a rush of people wanting to buy the stock because it just split, I can buy one (1) share if I want to and with dividend reinvesting I can even buy fractions os a share.

Both of these companies make calls to generate price fluctuation and I don't consider them credible. Only negative I could see from the report was a very slight disappointment in guidance. The company reaffirmed guidance for 2018 core EPS of $5.70 on full-year organic revenue growth of at least 2.3%. The Street is at full-year core EPS of $5.71. We are talking one penny for pete's sakes. Why PEP decided to do this I have no idea but this is the consequence we see from the move.

Stock Lost 13.9% in September[Motley Fool]Keith Noonan, The Motley Fool,Motley Fool•October 10, 2018What happenedMicron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) stock fell 13.9% in September, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.Shares declined due to comments from management indicating that pricing for NAND memory had fallen in the quarter and bearish coverage from analysts. MU ChartMU ChartMU data by YCharts.Micron's chief financial officer, David Zinser, said at a conference held by Citigroup on Sept. 6 that overall prices for NAND memory (which has been the core of the company's growth) had fallen last quarter. Morgan Stanley analyst Shawn Kim published a research note the the same day outlining a bearish outlook for the memory-chip market, and the combination of these developments prompted steep sell-offs for Micron and other chip stocks.Three Micron NAND chips.Three Micron NAND chips.Image source: Micron Technologies. So whatStrong demand and pricing for memory chips have driven impressive sales and earnings gains for Micron over the last several years. However, the product category tends to be cyclical, so it's not surprising that indications that the NAND market is weakening would result in a decline for the company's stock.Micron reported third-quarter results on Sept. 20. Sales and earnings both came in ahead of the market's expectations, but a deflated outlook for memory prices meant that the stock didn't get much of a bounce from the otherwise impressive results. Revenue climbed 38% to reach $8.44 billion, beating the average analyst revenue estimate by $190 million. Non-GAAP net income rose 75% year over year, coming in at $3.53 per share and exceeding the average analyst estimate for per-share earnings of $3.34. Now whatMicron stock has continued falling in October, with shares trading down roughly 8.1% as of this writing.MU ChartMU ChartMU data by YCharts.Shares now trade at roughly four times this year's expected earnings, which might look very cheap in light of the company's growth lately, but the cyclical nature of Micron's industry makes it difficult to chart the stock's future performance by looking at recent and near-term earnings performance. NAND pricing appears to be on track to continue falling, and the possibility that DRAM chips (Micron's other key product category) will lose pricing power means that the company's earnings could drop precipitously.",0.9706

Through pouring rights contracts, beverage companies place soda ads all over campus, make sure sugary drinks are readily available in every campus store and dining hall, and require student athletes to market company products to their fans by using beverage-branded equipment, water bottles, and cups (even when they’re just drinking water).In a presentation to University of New Mexico in 2018, Pepsi admitted to being “maniacally focused” on driving up soda sales, despite increasing demand for healthier options and decreasing popularity of soda.Students deserve a healthy environment to live and learn, without the manipulative marketing of soda companies.

I have kept accurate total returns for my holdings for MANY years (I didn't use a Beardstown Ladies' calculator LOL). Some years I've beaten VTSAX (Vanguard Total Market Index fund) and some years not; the variance hadn't been that great either way. While I enjoy investing in individual equities, a handful of years ago I opted to primarily invest new cash into VTSAX, besides my 401K. VTSAX is very tax efficient to boot. As it turns out, the past two years, the variance of returns was greater; in favor of VTSAX. Presently VTSAX (or equivalent) represents ~60 of my equity holdings.Back to my ""thinking""...I wondered how PEP had fared compared to VTSAX, since ""since the early 90's"".I used my initial VTSAX (VTSMX at the time, for those keeping score) buy date, 8/7/92.Total Return since 8/7/92PEP 1107%VTSAX 1040%S&P500 Consumer Index 1009%S&P500 1039%I scanned a Kiplinger article this AM re X number of dividend aristocrats that were on deep discount.It noted how aristocrats, as a whole, outperformed last year and over the long term (10 years); about a 150 bp annual difference compared to the S & P 500. (Curiously, I'm long five or so of the 18 ""deep discount"" aristocrats--CL,CVX, XOM, SWK, TROW (PEP may have been listed as well)--partially why my return was bested by VTSAX last year, but some of those names have rallied YTD).In your post, you had some great advice, although, I prefer to limit my exposure so as not to be too concentrated in one issue. I've had my share of huge gainers turn south. I'm not as disciplined, as I should be, when it comes to selling. Fortunately you didn't wait for PEP to split; you bought a few shares; you WON while those who were less educated....I remember when my father told me he was long a major industrial stock with a cost of around a buck (shares were, I don't know, 70 times or so greater at the time). Well with the years passing by, I've got a few issues with ridiculous cost baseis/bases (I just Googled ""plural of basis""). Buy ""good"" companies at ""good"" prices and add when you can. Bonus if the stock increases its dividend annually. Reinvest dividends.Not easy to do, but not that difficult either.Cheers",0.9952

794,"PEP will be interesting this next year. The company continues to press acquisitions and extra marketing funds to push the product. What was a loyal following in the past appears to be an anti-big-brand exit among the 30 and below generation. The CEO exit should be a big sign. Most CEOs struggle to exit when the company is at a record growth and EBITDA. Pepsi had continued to have executive exits at many of their brands. One should expect more exits in the next quarter, if not a complete shuffle of the executive team. This should not be a surprise as Al Carey was passed over for the CEO role. IT may not be bad to have a fleet of exits at Pepsi and Frito-Lay as the company has a strange set of executives over in-country operations. Normally, a company at the maturity of PEP has developed in-country nationals to lead the geographic areas. Ramon has a between 6 to 24 months to make a difference in local country revenue acceleration. 6-months if nothing is changed in the executive team and 24-months if he guts the team and places top talent, nationals in each of the operating markets. While Soda Stream is an interesting acquisition, it is not a game changer in the natural drinks, coffee, and extreme caffeine millennial markets, nor in the superfoods natural snacks. The company is uniquely worried to offend its Starbuck partnership by breaking into the warm drinks and cafe markets. Internationally, some countries have moved to warm Pepsi with dairy as a drink. Time to spinoff the snack divisions and start the innovation in caffeinated beverages again. Eliminate 50% of the executive and management layers to get innovation moving. PEP will be the next Sears if they continue to believe they can impose products on people and they are too big to fail. KO continues to innovate, time for PEP to get off the hamster wheel!",0.9935

819,"PEP drink one for me :Now, for the average investor, pursuing returns in a passive low-cost index fund is an acceptable way to invest for the long term. But that doesn't mean that 100% of an investor's funds should be invested this way. Investors should put a portion of their savings into more speculative investments – investments with the potential to return many times their initial investment.And lest you think that finding the next Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) is impossible in today's environment, let me assure you, it isn't. There are plenty of potential ""10-baggers"" available for investors to purchase today.One such company is Omeros Corporation (Nasdaq: OMER). The company is a small-cap biopharma headquartered in Seattle, Washington. The company develops small-molecule and protein therapeutics for application against inflammation, coagulopathies, and disorders of the central nervous system.Now, this is not a stock for investors seeking safety. The stock is volatile -- just as you might expect for a company developing cutting-edge drug therapies. But if you can stomach the volatility, OMER is a company that has the potential to deliver substantial profits over the next decade and longer. And now is a good time to consider grabbing a few shares of this company.You see, share prices dipped a few weeks ago on fears that Medicare wouldn't renew reimbursements for its Omeros' drug, Omidria. Omidria helps maintain pupil size in cataract surgeries or intraocular replacements. The recent omnibus bill eliminated those fears, and the stock is back on track to move higher.This is an important development because the continued sales and profits generated by Omidria are needed to power research into Omeros' new drug -- OMS721. Researchers at the University of Leicester discovered mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2). MASP-2 is a protein involved in activation of the immune system and plays a role in the inflammatory response. It is activated after tissue damage from trauma or infection. OMS721 has great potential to treat patients with lectin pathway activation.OMS721 is in Phase II and Phase III trials with four different potential uses. The FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to OMS721 for treatment on patients with high-risk hematopoietic stem cell transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy. This rare but deadly condition damages the smallest blood vessels inside many of the body's vital organs – most commonly the kidneys.Coincident to this designation, OMS721 also received breakthrough status for Berger's Disease (IgA nephropathy), a kidney disease caused when Immunoglobulin A lodges in the kidneys. Two other treatments for OMS721 are looking at other kidney problems associated with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and lupus nephritis.What all this means is that OMS721 is highly likely to deliver blockbuster revenues for years to come -- if approved. And that's enough to kick this stock into the stratosphere. On the other hand, the stock could tank if the clinical trials don't pan out as expected. And should that happen, expect to see about 75% of its value evaporate overnight.The NumbersNow, like most explosive growth stocks, Omeros has no earnings, so traditional fundamental analysis won't help determine a fair value for OMER. That's not to say we can't look at the company's financials, though.Last year, the company reported sales of $64.8 million -- a 55% increase over the previous period. Losses from operations totaled $44 million in 2017 -- a decrease of 19% against 2016. On a per share basis, the company lost $1.17 against $1.65 in 2016.And while there is reason to expect to see additional improvement in the fundamentals in 2018, that's not a certainty. But that's the nature of these kinds of stocks. The company will release its 1Q2018 results on May 10, 2018 -- so we'll get another taste of volatility then. But for long-term investors, Omeros has a potential cure for lackluster returns.Risks To Consider: Omeros is a small cap biopharma stock that is subject to wild volatility as it proceeds through the FDA approval process. And should the company be unsuccessful in getting its drugs approved, or if the FDA wants more data, the stock could experience an existential crisis for lack of access to capital.Action To Take: Buy shares up to $20. Mitigate risk by limiting your exposure to OMER of no more than 2% of your risk capital. This stock is speculative, and as such, is not suitable for short-term needs. Expect to hold the stock for at least 5-10 years. And during that time, expect greater than average volatility. It is not recommended to use a stop loss on this stock due to its volatility. Should the stock break out in the future, place a 25% trailing stop on your position.",0.9993

983,"Long read... It annoys me when people say, ""$CRSR doesn't deserve a high valuation,"" solely on the basis of two bearish cases, 1) the e-gaming & peripherals industries are not going to continue to grow at this rate (well no s**t sherlock), and 2) the company has debt, (who doesn't), but here are my rebuttals:- The e-gaming and peripherals industry is not going to grow at 70% this year, sorry eternal and out-of-touch bulls, but I can assure you that both the e-gaming industry & Corsair revenues will grow at rates well over 10% this year. So does that mean $CRSR deserves a P/S ratio of 1.8? Well lets look at a company who's business model will be much more effected by a switch from Covid-19 lockdowns to a back-to-normal economy… - $ZM - Zoom Video Communications. $ZM is expected to post revenues of $2.6B this year, but their market cap is currently residing at $117.6B. My common sense tells me video communications are going to see the same industry decline that e-gaming will face, if not a sharper decline in overall industry revenues. So why then does ZM deserve a P/S of 55 and CRSR a P/S of 1.8? - Let's look at price-to-sales/price-to-earnings adjusted for growth and see if that hides anything... ZM has a P/S/G of 14.268, CRSR has a P/S/G of 3.826, and for all you saying CRSR isn't profitable, ZM has a P/E/G of 49.745, CRSR has a P/E/G of 5.65. Talk about undervalued, no matter how you spin it, CRSR's valuation is well below stocks in similar industries (in terms of covid-related growth), FYI you can use these metrics for every growth stock and CRSR comes out on top almost every time. - Not to mention, CRSR has a P/S ratio lower than those of legacy companies with dying revenue growth, look at $KO & $PEP. But back to the argument, CRSR is anywhere from 4-50X undervalued compared to ZM, a company who will see slower revenue growth thanks to the Covid vaccine.- $CRSR's debt-to-equity ratio, Warren Buffet's favorite indicator of a company's health, is shrinking FAST! This is great news for all you noobs out there, a DER of under 2 is considered healthy, and for a growth stock, anything under 5 is somewhat healthy, or at least normal. - Corsair has dropped its DER from over 4 to 1.37 this past quarter, if that doesn't scream FCF, I don't know what does. Not to mention large organizations like $ORCL have a current DER of over 1 but have very bulky valuation ratios. Any way you spin it, CRSR's debt is diminishing fast as CRSR grows their margins and start to rake in serious income.All around, CRSR's valuation absurdly low, I blame the share lock-up for low supply of shares (float) which converts to easy market manipulation by institutions who have tossed around shares in the company (recently % of shares held by institutions has ranged from low 20's to low 10's). When institutions hold only a small % of shares, it typically means less analyst coverage, less catalysts for the ticker to trend or boom, aka, less retail investors buying, exactly why we see extremely low average volume which in turn allows for more market manipulation. Long read, but all my opinion on current scenario, I currently see CRSR as a $100 company and have stake in said company.",0.9956

1434,"JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Greenpeace says global consumer brands continue to buy palm oil from companies that are cutting down Indonesia's rainforests despite repeated pledges to clean up their supply chains.The environmental group said in a report released Wednesday that 25 palm oil producing groups it has investigated destroyed more than 130,000 hectares of natural forest in Indonesia since 2015. It says that's an area nearly twice the size of the island nation of Singapore.The report said all but one of those producers had supplied palm oil to consumer companies that are household names around the world in the past year. They include giants such as Nestle, PepsiCo, Unilever and Colgate-Palmolive.Palm oil, mainly produced in Indonesia and Malaysia, is used in a slew of consumer products from snacks to cosmetics.Some 16 major consumer goods companies made a joint commitment in 2010 to end the buying of palm oil from producers who are destroying forests and committing human rights abuses but have been repeatedly criticized for lack of progress.Greenpeace said the commitments on paper had frequently been used to create the appearance of taking action without making real changes.Years after adopting conservation policies, ""brands and traders are still unable to monitor the producer groups in their supply chains,"" the group said.The Greenpeace report also mentions evidence of child and other forced labor in Indonesia's palm oil industry but mainly focuses on the environmental problems. It singled out palm oil giant Wilmar as the biggest offender among the 25 groups it investigated.Rapid forest loss and greenhouse gas emissions have made Indonesia the fourth biggest contributor to global warming after China, the U.S. and India.""The palm oil industry's failure to address deforestation and other notorious practices is putting its long term future in doubt,"" said Greenpeace. ""Public opinion in many major markets is already turning against palm oil.""The influential International Union for Conservation of Nature earlier this year said bans on palm oil are not a solution because other sources of plant oil require as much as nine times more land.It said a ban would likely only ""displace"" forest and species destruction to other areas. Concerted action is needed to make the palm oil a responsible and ""sustainable"" industry, it said.",-0.9665
