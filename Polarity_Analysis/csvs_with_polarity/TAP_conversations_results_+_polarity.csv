Add to that a culture of no accountability and allowing everyone to work from home in marketing, finance, strategy and HR and you've got big problems that will continue to make this and underperforming stock.

86,"Folks, let me get you all in with another piece of education in the beer business. There is this thing called shipment, which it drives the top line in the company’s p&l. It is the volume that shipped to the wither the distributor or retail channels if sold direct. The other piece of volume data is called depletion. Depletion is what retail channel sold to the consumers. This is a critical piece of measurement to me. It is the true demand side from the consumers. It me be clear, I don’t know what that number is. How do I gauge it then, you ask? Simple, I “walk” the market. I observe people’s purchasing behaviors in the beer isle of all stores. I observe what people drink when I am at a on-premise establishment or when I go to a party. Let me tell you people drink all kinds of craft brews. A few macro brews here and there. It tells me that volume is not picking up. Ford motors also offers a larger dividend payout, but I don’t buy ford stock either.

See case: Edwin Moldauer v Constelation Brands v US gov in Washington DC 15-5103 Court of Appeals.We had the case in abeyance for last 5 years. Although we gave him a severance in 2002, we chase him out of the country, we turned around and sued him soon after and filed criminal charges for stealing our trade secrets. He complain beforehand to FBI and SEC about our accounting. Later he complain about our severance and our retaliation, see Sarbanes Oxley Act. We got the courts and goverments to character assasinate him as we do to all our problem employees. We use social and printed media to do that behind the scene. We even had a sexual harrassment case widely published were we smear the plaintiff with juicy stories. At 51 there was nothing left for the terminated employee at Coors to look for. If to compare to us, another 18 years of wrongful litigation he would have been 69 and deadbeat broken. Sad case indeed.",-0.9787

On-prem orders allow company to move greater volumes but at cheaper wholesale prices-- apples and oranges-- off-prem is higher margin. So, to point to a 3.1% decrease in sales without considering the shift from on-prem to off-prem is just poor analysis. What people should be asking is: how sticky is this incredible off-prem growth? Will a return of on-prem come at the expense of off prem growth? Because, if any of you guys care to transpose and extrapolate a trailing 5 year average on-prem sales volume over the top of recent off-prem volumes, you get a high single digit comp y/y-- I reiterate, something to be celebrated.

Molson has already said they plan on cannabis products rolling off the assembly line in time for October. Molson's partner $HEXO has already said they flavorless cannabis molecules that can be added to any beverage. We already know Tilray has flavorless cannabis oil as they are selling it at the OCS under the brand name Irisa. You can bet Bud will have competing product rolling off their assembly lines at the same time as Molson.This is high margin as beer is much more expensive in Canada than in America. In Ontario, the cheapest beer is $1.50 a bottle. The government actually sets a floor (a minimum price that can be charged for a beer. It was recently lowered to a buck and no brewers are selling at that price). The third largest player in Ontario is Sapporo, which co-owns the Beer Store with BUD and TAP.

Where I live alone several microbreweries opened. Even in COVID times their outdoor gardens are open. This is taking away any potential for sales growth IMO. 2. Milleniels will not drink if it means drinking the big brands. Once more, the bars I do go to are pulling Miler/Coors/Bud taps and replacing with micros. I am a Miller Lite guy and when I do go out no one, and I mean no one under 40 is drinking the national brands. This demographic reality is showing up in TAP numbers and I see no catalyst to change that. If they do sell their euro brands then this is just a zombie. Too late to seltzer party as well. I studied the beer industry and it is a mirror image of the 30 year period post prohibition. In 20 years I believe Miller and Coors will ultimately be local brands around the breweries that remain (Milwaukee, Golden) that do contract brews as well.

Probably no one. They will protect their own at the cost of us the shareholders. I haven't heard a peep as to what TAP is planning to do to make sure it wont happen again. Terrible management. TAP will continue to disappoint until new management is put into place. come on TAP, at least tell us who's going to be fired over the sloppy financial reporting catastrophe that cost us shareholders close to 9% of our investment in a single day.

But you can just mix your own drinks with spirits... it's a no-brainer, so one that even even the young dumbazzz selzter-guzzlers will figure out eventually. Spirits-makers is the obvious choice if you want to invest in booze.@@@The heads of the three largest beer companies in Canada were together on a stage, sitting around an unusually small table, talking about their collective decline to a crowd of bar owners and restaurateurs. “Am I concerned? I’d be a liar if I didn’t say yes,” said Kyle Norrington, president of Labatt Brewing Co. Ltd., the Canadian wing of global beer conglomerate Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV. A recent report from industry group Beer Canada had just shown a three-per-cent drop in total sales volumes in 2019, compared to 2018....But beer brewers might be the only ones in the alcoholic beverage industry fighting such declines. Despite some signs that younger generations aren’t as into alcohol as their parents, Canadians don’t appear to be drinking less overall, just less beer. Annual beer consumption fell by more than 10 litres per person aged 15 and older between 2004 and 2018, according to Statistics Canada’s most recent data. But in the same time period, the total volume of pure alcohol sold increased modestly, to 8.2 litres per person per year from eight litres.https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/are-we-really-drinking-less-or-why-white-claws-arrival-means-more-bad-news-for-brewers",0.9846

First, their expansion into the alcohol seltzer category and their reduction in operational fat were both a success. Second, there will be no BUD commercials during the Superbowl that take aim at TAP this year. Third, TAP is not trading at all with the potential they possess of being first to market in the emerging alcoholic-weed infused beverage market (assuming their partnership with HEXO is actually getting this play right) and actually having a P/E sub 20. Most investors know that all of the publicly traded marijuana companies lose money (which a view TAP slightly as) and this seems as one the safest way to play both of the world's most favorite vices.",0.9617
