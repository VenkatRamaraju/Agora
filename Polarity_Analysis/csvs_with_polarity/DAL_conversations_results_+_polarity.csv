It Didn’t Go as Planned.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/business/energy-environment/delta-oil-refinery-jet-fuel.htmlDelta’s foray into oil refining illustrates some of the reasons the business was in trouble even before the pandemic.Today, airlines and refineries face their biggest crises in modern times. Tens of millions of people are working from home, and the number of people flying is down about 75 percent from a year ago. Delta’s refinery, Monroe Energy, has been one of many casualties in an industry that is working well below capacity, idling plants and losing money.Monroe, in Trainer, Pa., lost $114 million in the second quarter, and its future appears bleak. In 2018, Delta announced that it was interested in finding a partner to jointly own and operate it, but it never found any takers.“The refinery may not even be a live albatross,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service. “We don’t see jet fuel becoming a marquee moneymaker for refiners again until the middle of the decade, if then.”“It’s a refinery that could shut down if nobody wants to buy it,” said John Auers, executive vice president of Turner Mason & Company, an energy consulting firm. “I don’t think Delta is interested in running it longer term. It didn’t play out as they thought it would.”",0.9609

So essentially, this stock is a gamble on how long this coronavirus will last and you just can't know.. And all of this assumes that the airline industry will operate normally after those 3 months, which will never be the case. They will probably operate at 50-70% of normal capacity in my opinion so some of them might actually still lose money then which adds even more risk to this investment right now. Also, I really think that Warren Buffett is fearing bankruptcy for a lot of airline companies as well. He might as well be selling the other airline stocks as well without us knowing it for weeks ( under 10% ). This was a good learning experience for me, I bought before I did enough research.

On a consolidated basis, weexpect to reduce our average daily cash outflow to approximately $40 million by June 30, 2020, down from approximately $100 million per day as ofMarch 31, 2020. We expect this reduction to be primarily driven by a greater than 50% reduction in our operating expenses for the June 2020 quarter, ascompared to the June 2019 quarter, as well as recent improvement in net sales and stabilization in refund requests. We are seeking to reduce our averagedaily cash outflow to zero by December 31, 2020. We believe this improvement in average daily cash outflow would result from modest continued demandrecovery, particularly with domestic leisure travel beginning to return as states lift shelter-in-place orders, and additional cost-cutting initiatives.

Vaccines are being worked on at a fast rate, so positive news and test trials are coming out monthly. Officials have stated we could see a working vaccine before the end of 2020. What recovery will happen faster is the same way airlines recovered a month ago...states moving up in their reopening phases. Things pulled back after AZ, TX, and FL weren't enforcing safety protocols like other states, so naturally, infection numbers for those states increased. Keep in mind, death rates have slowed down, but the goal is to slow the infections so it's manageable.....which it is. We've been through this already 3 months ago and the market has learned. The institutions know how to take advantage of these knee jerk selloffs and know these pullbacks are opportunities. The fundamentals are still very strong for DAL in the short and long term.

Lots of UNknown still out:1- Will the revenue from 777 summer season pan out or will it be a failure due to low traveling.2- All these furlows (layoffs) are yet to be resolved. Will people accept early retirement or accept cut in pay ?, etc. No one really knows the answer to that yet. How will it affect their cash flow?At the end of march they show roughly 2.9 Billion in receivable( I am quite certain that number has dwindled down substantially by now. Besides that they show at march $5,9 Billion of cash (with their daily cash burn of at least 80 million a day : 90 days X 80 million= 7.2 Billion as of June 30). So no cash left with current liability due as of march of 19 Billion which includes 6.5 billion of accounts payable, now you explain to me how they solve that problem? Please someone explains it to me as if I were a 4 years old.3- On Delta reducing its daily cash burn : Will they accomplish this within he next 6 months: very doubtful.4-Will the next 6 months traffic be adequate to accomplish the 3 points above mentioned. That's a big question mark.Personally I previously owned Delta , price paid $19.60 a share.

The airlines did get some government bail outs but with airline traffic being down almost 95% and the majority of our airplanes parked that money won’t go very far.-Masks are required to board a flight but many people are refusing to wear them because it infringes on their rights. I know some have medical issues that prevent them from wearing one and we can’t challenge anyone’s refusal to wear one. -Airlines have been offering rock bottom tickets ($29 round trip from Miami to LA) to try to get business. Unfortunately people are jumping on those tickets just because they’ve never been to LA.-Airlines are considered essential and they have transported several medical personnel, usually for free, as well as valuable medical equipment and supplies all over the world. -Flight schedules have been destroyed with airlines only operating a small fraction of their previous flights. -Flights are now filling up and sadly there are daily disturbances on board our airplanes because people think they should have the airplane to themselves. How can you question one persons “need” to travel over your own??-Airline employees have showed up to work every day and been exposed daily trying to get people where they need to go.

That starts today, and there has been a great deal of press coverage about it this past week so I took the plunge - and to quote George Peppard: ""I love it when a plan comes together"". DAL has a lot of affiliate partners in the Eu so I expected their stock to jump if the June 3 plan was enacted and luckily for me (us) it was.

It’s currently trading just under $30. At $60, the economy was at near perfect. Macro economics are far worse now. Even when (or if) a vaccine becomes available and air travel goes back to pre-Covid levels, the debt load, equity dilution and government stakeholder, makes airlines unattractive for any foreseeable future.

United Airlines is priced at $25/share with $23 billions in debt and $5 billion dollars in cash. Air Canada is priced at $16/share with $10 billion dollars in debt and $6 billion dollars in cash....so which one airlines looks undervalued based on its financials? Definitely Air Canada is and the reason why its a HUGE buy righ now! Air Canada is flagship airlines for Canada and has less competition compared to US Airlines who are struggling with debt.

886,"This guy named Shayna knows the game, very intelligent guy "" Biden I'm not smart money, but if I was, this is what I'd do. It's a pretty safe bet we'll see a vaccine by Thanksgiving. We'll likely get leaks of a vaccine, preliminary results, etc, before ...meaning the market could start moving end of August, or Sept. People that see the vaccine is more likely, will start hunting for deals in the market before the investors that need less risk, and really, the deals that are left are banks and travel and leisure, casinos, cyclicals, etc. Behind this will be a massive, world wide wave of optimism that things will be returning to to normal. When the vaccine is out, and proven effective, there will be a world wide party the likes of which we haven't seen. This will create buy pressure everywhere, and massive optimism. Tech stocks are also due for a pretty decent correction, money is going to rotate out of them and that money will also be looking for a deal. Stimulus money is coming back into the market soon, that will be largely retail investors looking for cheap stocks, again, buy pressure. This is a perfect storm of buy pressure across entire industries. Add to this, that in these cruise stocks, institutions are controlling nearly 90% of the float for most of the cruise stocks, and some these stocks have almost a 20% short interest. If these institutions decide to hold for a bit, this will dry up the float, and make for an epic short squeeze we've not seen in a while.

1010,"I just wanted to contribute my thoughts here as a recent long investor: Delta is doing great. There is no denying their recent growth has been fantastic for such a large company. +6% in revenues and +30% in earnings in 2019. However, they continue to trade at a PE that indicates static to shrinking earnings...roughly 1/2 of similar growing companies in the S&P. Clearly the market was not sure if this growth trend will last. Recently, we got fantastic 2020 guidance from Delta projecting the growth to continue into 2020 with multiple expansion projects and investments ongoing and the market response was positive with a jump into the $60's and grinding higher every day. Almost immediately the coronavirus news hit. Since then, we've had a -12% decline in market cap. While there is no doubt considerable risk and uncertainty, I note that the entire Pacific segment for Delta (which is larger than the China market they just suspended) is only 5% of Delta revenues. The vast majority of their profits are domestic and American flights and services. In addition, this is the winter quarter when they have the fewest flights to get canceled anyway. I'm thinking that this is a bit overblown from a long perspective even for the virus risks and even assuming all Asian flights eventually get and stay canceled for 3 months like the Chinese ones have been suspended. Why? Because this is a transient event. We've had these outbreaks before and they will abate either naturally or when the vaccine comes out. Keep in mind that even given worst-case scenario where this goes global, there are vaccine candidates already developed that will be distributable in a couple months. When there is a vaccine, the fear of traveling will be over and Delta will return to prior performance. This is very likely to be a one and done 1-2 quarter event even given worst-case (and there is no guarantee we will get worst case, SARS and MERS both died out naturally). They will be fine over the long-term and this seems a pretty good buying opportunity if you are a long investor. Only question is...where is the bottom? Hard to call, but I may start nibbling soon in the $55's. Long-term risk/reward here seems impressive. No other growing S&P sector is this cheap and their flight expenses and refinery business will benefit from the dirt cheap oil prices during this scare as well, helping to offset some of the losses this quarter.",0.992

1022,"Delta will survive this downturnEstimating the impact of this massive downturn in demand on Delta's cash flow is much harder. Typically, airlines generate a ton of cash in the second quarter from customers booking summer travel in advance. If those bookings don't come through (because the COVID-19 pandemic is still raging two or three months from now), Delta Air Lines could see a bigger hit to cash flow than the decline in its pre-tax income.Still, between its existing liquidity and the numerous assets it can borrow against, Delta should have no trouble making it through the current crisis. Travel demand is likely to start improving within a few months, although the pace at which it will bounce back is uncertain. And if history is a guide, there could be a ton of pent-up demand hitting the market later this year or in 2021.In short, Delta Air Lines may have to absorb some big losses this year, but it has the balance sheet strength to do so. The airline giant is likely to come back strong in 2021. With Delta shares having lost more than a third of their value just in the past month, this is a stock worth considering for risk-tolerant long-term investors.",0.5947

April and May revenue will be less than 10% the usual numbers and Delta probably lost over half of the revenue in March. 2019 was 49 billion so between March, April and May Delta probably losses 10 billion. Ed Bastian said over a month ago they expect Delta to be getting 70% the usual revenue by December but that was before we realized that things were not gonna be normal until a vaccine. So 50% the revenue from July to December, and that's being as generous as you could possible get and it will probably be a lot less than that, is basically 12 billion less revenue. Add less than half the usual revenue in June and you have 26 billion less revenue in 2020 at the very least. The most happy possible number is 6 billion less revenue than in 2009.So no, Delta isnt worth 24 dollars a share.",0.9821

1086,"Delta Stock Is Rocky Now, But the Long-Term Payoff Is HugeDAL stock will get a massive boost over the summer as travel patterns return to normalBy Mark R. Hake, CFA Jun 15, 2020, 3:52 pm EDTI’m glad I changed my mind on Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock in my last article. On June 1, 2020, I wrote, “Delta Air Lines Stock Will Climb As Travelers Return to the Sky,” predicted a turnaround in DAL stock.Delta (DAL) Stock Is Rocky Now, But the Long-Term Payoff Is HugeSource: Markus Mainka / Shutterstock.comAt the time, the stock was at $25.21 on May 29. By Friday, the stock closed at $30.43. That represents a gain of 20.7%. Even, if you start with the closing price on June 1 of $26.27, the return for any reader of that article has been 16.3%.My point is that Delta seems to have reached an inflection point. The stock has moved around a good deal since that article, but the bottom line is that it seems to have bottomed out.Now I am predicting that the same rebound will continue. I expect that Delta will continue to show gains over the next several months, and here’s why:DAL Stock: Delta Will Likely Trend HigherFirst, I believe that the market is beginning to accept that the company will not go bankrupt. It seems to have enough liquidity to last through the hard times of severely reduced revenue.As I pointed out in my last article, the company’s cash burn was at $50 million per day as of mid-May. It expects to get down to $40 million per day by the end of June. Ultimately, it expects to get down to zero cash burn by the end of the year. This would largely be due to a huge pickup in airline travel demand. I pointed out that most of the major airlines expect the same thing.Second, it appears that travel demand is clearly picking up. For example, if you go to the TSA’s checkpoint travel site, traffic can be seen to be improving. The numbers show airport traffic was down 81% on June 11 from last year. But a month ago, on May 11, traffic was worse, at off 91.4%. On April 11, traffic was at 95.4% of the prior year. In other words, the numbers seem to be improving by 10 percentage points a month and are accelerating on the upside.Third, analysts are getting more positive on Delta stock. Seeking Alpha says that 15 analysts now project average earnings per share of $3.65 in 2021, after an expected loss in 2020. That puts DAL stock on a forward price-earnings ratio of just 8.3 times earnings. That seems pretty cheap. It implies that the stock could move further higher as travel traffic picks up over the summer.",0.9975

1125,"Liquidated all my positions in DAL today. Very nice runup, and congrats to everyone that held from the $20's! At this point I feel the stock is a little overpriced, though I think DAL will do fine longer term. Here are the near-term risks I see that will prevent the stock from reaching old highs in the upper $50's anytime soon imo:- DAL is still losing money for the foreseeable future even by their own projections. That has narrowed to a cash burn of $30M/day from 100M/day in March, but that is still billions a quarter. - Airlines were looking forward to this holidays as it was going to put them much closer to break-even for a quarter, but with COVID cases surging globally we are already seeing a rash of travel cancellations. If the numbers keep worsening the holiday travel season may be significantly curtailed and significant losses could ensue for airlines that had kept staff operating expecting more demand. - Until the vaccine is widely distributed there is no reason to assume that travel numbers will improve as winter is traditionally the worst season for travel anyway with low demand. The vaccines will start shipping hopefully towards the end of December, but it will take quite some time for enough to be produced that it will make a dent in travel numbers. The slowest part of ramping up vaccinations is the production, which is biological and ponderous. Pfizer, the most ambitious player, stated they were targeting a bit over 1B doses for all of 2021. Orders have already been comitted to the EU, so it isn't as if the US will get vaccinated first. It will go to the highest bidder and travel will be slow until it is widely distributed to middle income populations, which could be as far out as summer 2021. - Conclusion: cash burn will continue and DAL and peers will keep on having to take on more and more debt for at least several more months. Already, DAL has absolutely destroyed their balance sheet. Shareholder equity (assets-liabilities) has declined to near-zero as a result of 12B+ of new net debt in the first 2 quarters alone. Book value will go negative very soon. They will probably survive on government grants and unbacked bonds as the debt markets are healthy, but they will be emerging from this a very different company with a mountain of high-interest debt. The debt they have added already in just 2 quarters would take about 3.5 years to pay down even if business and operating margins returned immediately to record levels in 2019. And let's face it, travel numbers will not be recovering to highs for a while. Not until vaccination is global and the pandemic has burned out. This is my synposis of the industry and why I feel that DAL $40+ is entering overvaluation territory on speculation. It isn't enough that travel numbers recover to 2019 levels for the stock to reach old highs. Their debt position, interest costs, and sharecount have all increased. Dividend probably won't be nearly as high as they will need to focus on paying down the high interest debt. Thus a single share just isn't worth what it was in 2019 even if travel numbers recover to records. Note that peers like UAL and AAL that were in a shaky debt position with near-zero book value traded at a lower P/E multiple compared to DAL. DAL will now likely trade at that lower multiple as well even as things normalize until they pay the debt down. A possible tailwind is if UAL or AAL declare bankruptcy or has to issue higher ticket costs due to their even worse debt positions compared to DAL. GLTA! Just wanted to share my thoughts for those that care to read!",0.3303

1418,"Wanted to post an update giving some numbers rather than speculation as there is a lot of opinions being thrown about. Firstly, there is no way we get a long local travel ban in the US. Americans will not accept a violation of their freedom to travel locally like that. In fact, govt. provisions for the aid require airlines keep lines between cities open so it is clear they think it is a matter of national security to keep some service open. Also, consider that in a few weeks we'll start to have quite a few people who have already had COVID-19 and recovered that are not worried about traveling anymore since they had it already. That number will grow as the summer progresses. The fact that detected cases are skyrocketing is actually pretty good for the travel industry as it indicates this may burn through quicker than expected. Also keep in mind based on many estimates and one study (Icelandic study) that we know the number of mild or asymptomatic cases is VERY high. Like 90% or higher. So when you see 225,000 diagnosed in the US, the number that have had COVID is likely well over 2M already and climbing rapidly. Now, this event will still do serious damage to the DAL balance sheet, but thankfully they and LUV had better ones to start with. DAL's book value was +$15.4B end of 2019. When travel comes back, DAL will be able to rebuild that sooner rather than later based on their demonstrated cash flow of several billion per year. They have also been able to stockpile cheap crude oil for their refinery business, which will generate a substantial savings over the next year. The company estimated $2B in cost savings back in Mid-March. Also, consider the book value changes even for worst case scenario: Based on the CEO's statement of $50M cash/day burned from a few weeks ago, we can calculate a value of $9.1B for expenses for the next 6 months if Delta changes nothing to lower their expenses (and they will lower them further and already have taken steps to do so). Do they have the liquidity to handle this? Yes, with their known credit facilities, stockpiled cash, and a small amount of govt loans or grants they will easily have enough cash to cover the next 6 months even paying all current employees. Now, even if they make $0 in revenue (which they will make something even if profit is negative), that would only be $9B in debt added. What was their book value before this started? $15.4B. You can do the math, but I estimate that the worst-case scenario is a 50% decline in BV given there will be some revenue (not none) and the costs after their cost-saving measures the past few weeks will have lowered that $9B figure, particularly the aircraft maintenance costs which are quite high for Delta given their older fleet. I think the actual BV decline will be closer to 25-30% given that business will pick up as people with COVID-19 recover and no longer worry about flying. Also, keep in mind they have a cargo business as well as the jet fuel refinery business, though though both are smaller than the passenger segment. So my estimate for common shareholder BV worst case to what I think is more likely is: $12-18. Keep in mind that Delta always trades over their BV though because of their high cash flow and flush margins. Once this event passes, they will be rebuilding the balance up to at least the point that they have positive tangible book value (as that was what they maintained up until now), which will likely be at least $1B added every year at minimum given their prior performance in the industry. I hope that they will reduce bonuses for the next 2 years as they do this, but we'll see. Delta has always focused on returning part of their high cash flow to both shareholders and employees through the larger year-end bonus of >$1B.",0.9986

1455,"Hey did a bit more research on DAL, and I thought I'd post my analysis. I think given the data we have that this will be another solid earnings quarter, and I think that the current analyst consensus for Q4 and next year appears VERY conservative, likely due to concerns over operating costs and the impending return of 737 and airbus tariffs: The past 3 quarters Delta has smashed expectations. Revenue has grown over 5% over last year, resulting in large increases in operating profit and EBITDA of over 20% due to their large fixed costs. This quarter appears no different to me from the 2 operating reports we have. The first one from October had exceptional passenger growth of 5.8% over last year, this latest November one growth was more moderate at 1.7% and there was concern about a dip in load factor, but keep in mind that Delta has been expanding their fleet and that we are comparing to an exceptional 2018 November, where passenger growth was abnormal over 2017 at +4%. Add to this that we already know oil prices stayed pretty low until just a few days ago, so fuel costs will be low for Q4 again as Delta has likely already filled their orders for crude for the year and beyond to use in their refineries, and also add to this the fact that share repurchases over the past year have been over 6% of all outstanding shares. Delta is buying a lot of their own stock at these levels when it dips, and likely did again this quarter when it dipped to $51-53 range. Also, the recent announcements that the Boing 737 will continue to be grounded until Q2 of 2020 bodes will for Delta continuing to take market share and experience record passengers. And then we have the upcoming expansions and capital investments: expansions of multiple terminals, many new plane orders, new routes to Europe/Asia, LATAM partnership going live this December...Delta is on track to capitalize well in this market of growing air demand. However...analysts appear extremely mixed on earnings growth. Their revenue consensus projections seem in line with what Delta has demonstrated at 5% growth for next 2 quarters and 3.8% for next year, but their eps projections are very low, indicating nearly flat expectations with last year and in 2020, showing analysts expect a very large increase in operating costs even while Delta continues to expand and take significant market share. Now, we do know that Delta raised wages and airbus tariffs are in effect, but it is debatable if operating costs will rise to this extreme degree imo. For instance, analysts currently project this Q4 will show 5.5% increase in revenue over 2018 Q4, but only a mere 6.2% increase in eps. Given that share repurchases over the past year have actually also been a bit over 6% as well, this indicates they think net profits will be flat, indicating an expected huge increase in operating costs. Similar projections are made in 2020 as well. I think this is unlikely for several reasons, but here are a few: airbus tariffs are being mitigated by the Mobile plant in Alabama, and airbus is expanding capacity there. There is also no reason to believe they will be in effect indefinitely. The point of the tariffs was to bring Europe to the negotiating table regarding subsidies to airbus and other tariff issues. It may take a while, but it will eventually be resolved imo. Also, with Delta having already demonstrated earlier in the year that they think this level is undervalued enough for substantial share repurchases, I am fairly sure that if they continue to trade at 7-8 PE they will keep buying shares at an accelerated rate. This alone will lift eps, but I am also doubtful management would be so profligate with ramping up capital costs that they won't be able to capitalize at all on a 5%+ revenue increase on the bottom line. This has not been their MO in the past, which is focused on returning value to both employees and shareholders. I expect moderate continued earnings growth, though not as great as the past 2 quarters which benefitted from rock bottom crude prices. When this is demonstrated, Delta should also eventually return to its historical PE evaluation, which is more like 10 from my research, not the 7-8 they have been trading at this fall. The only reason they would trade here while making record profits and revenues is if people expect their current performance to be transient. So these next 2 quarters will be key in demonstrating that they can keep up the momentum. Regardless, I feel very good holding long here. There are large potential capital gains if DAL returns to historical evaluations. Airline business is expected to continue to grow over the next few years and DAL is a strong player actively taking market share and expanding. Also, they have an excellent recent track record with raising the dividend substantially every summer for several years and conducting share repurchases. This is an excellent entry point and nice dividend while you wait!",0.9996

Delta (airlines) analysis Pre Covid-19 airlines - paid dividends - Paying down debt- Profitable - CustomersPost COVID-19 - no more dividends - Raising huge amounts of debt- Government has a financial position - Cash burn of 30-50 million a month- No profits- 70-80 percent passenger load from pre-Covid- Airlines have said unlikely to return to normal for 3 or more years- Equity issue dilution - Unemployment at 16%- Infections spiking in several states offers future uncertainty for closing and restrictions Pre Covid, Delta was trading around $60. It’s currently trading just under $30. At $60, the economy was at near perfect. Macro economics are far worse now. Even when (or if) a vaccine becomes available and air travel goes back to pre-Covid levels, the debt load, equity dilution and government stakeholder, makes airlines unattractive for any foreseeable future. Unless stock prices fall much further. There is still a high risk of bankruptcy from more than one airline. At $30 this stock appears a value trap and is overvalued. Value would be in the low teens with a price target of $12.50.",-0.597

I just don't think new investors realize a few things. I've tried to explain this to my friend who put a thousand dollars of his stim check in order to receive dividends. Jemy. This is for you if you come on here.The reason why I prefer JETS over Delta. Now again, Delta is good. It will most likely be around. Just because a company files bankruptcy doesn't mean it will disappear. I think DELTA has filed BK before? Not too certain. Alright1. The loans from the goverment allows for more government control. This means they can't cut costs by laying off employees which is what should be done...2. The dividends will probably be reduced or cut for a while.3. Airlines won't reach 2019 numbers for a couple years 2-5years.4. The recent market increase is for numerous reasons beyond logic and fundamentals.So jets is safer if you're investing large amounts of money. Delta isn't bad if you're throwing a couple hundreds and are younger. You have the time and the risk tolerance. If I were invested in DELTA I would pull out now and then buy back in. That's just me and if you're new just invest and put stop losses. If I were a parent or someone older I would find a airline with a stronger balance shee. This is fine though. I don't think it's bad.

The way the administration is running things and wanting to re-open asap while less than 1% of Americans have been tested and while we hear that China, Singapore and S. Korea are experiencing a resurgence of cases, there is a distinct possibility that things will NOT get back to normal for much longer than we are being told. Besides, what would be ""normal"" for airlines? Being able to operate at 25% capacity? 40%? 60%?

1898,A few positives during todays turbulent market1. DAL and airlines are outperforming during one of the worst days for the market all year. Clearly this is a sign of a cyclical rotation from tech to value. This is a great sign for airline stocks going forward. We saw DAL up at 32.5 before being dragged down by the rest of the market. 2. The overall markets being down could be the catalyst for Washington to pass the stimulus bill. We need a mini correction to get both sides of the isle to negotiate. There is less incentive when the market is at all time highs. This stimulus bill is likely to include aid for airlines. 3. Tech underperforming might be a sign that we are finally getting Covid under control.,0.9729

And since 84% of the stocks are held by just 10% of the richest people. they are literally supported by a money printing machine. Working class cannot buy more stocks when market tanked because they got laid off and have to conserve money and may even have to sell stock to survive, while the rich with millions lying around can buy at the bottom then have the FED pump it up.

2421,Pansy died two week's ago yesterday. I was quiet about it. I've been in shock. Between the move to my new house and Pansy's death I've been in deep shock. I don't make it through any day without sobbing about him. I was working from home. Pansy was in his bed by my feet. He left his bed and jumped up on his favorite chair. Because I was on a call I didn't notice a thing. Nothing out of the ordinary. Since COVID hit I've been working from home and he's been so happy to have his dada home.My conf call ended. I went into the kitchen to heat up some pizza. I looked into the living room and pansy hadn't moved. Weird. He always came into the kitchen when he knew I was there because he knew treats were there and I spoiled him rotten. But this time? No movement.So I went into the living room and called his name as I walked toward him. No movement. Then I touched him and knew he was gone. Almost 13 years with him and just gone. No warning. No cancer. No stroke. No seizures. No noise. No pain. No warning. He just died in his sleep.I just wanted people to know that we all suffer. We all feel loss. Pansy's passing leaves me shattered. He was my rock. He was my constant companion and buddy. He was my little boy.Rest in peace my beautiful little baby boy.BoOut,-0.9672

Masks required while on board/in airports, only 1 person per row, for example? Stewardesses walking around with spray bottles of alcohol on boarding, and before/after meals? Low fuel prices will somewhat offset cost differences, and tickets cost may have to go up to compensate lower passenger numbers - could an industry price agreement be possible rather than the intense competition we've seen grow in recent years?There are plenty of working people and people who live far away from family and friends that will still be willing to take flights as soon as they're allowed too - I'm one of them.One of WB's main points last night should not be forgotten - no ones forcing you to sell, and if you believe in the industry, stick with them and be willing to accept a short term loss.

If it was so devastating, it would've pulled back significantly more. So much is already priced in and no one is surprised they were going to miss in so many areas during Q2 pandemic that every company is taking a hit on. I was thinking a 5% pullback at worst for an initial knee jerk reaction, but so far premarket is holding relatively steady. Personally, too many people put too much weight on quarterly numbers and overreact....when long term value is what most investors should be concerned about. Things that happened in March are not happening now. Right now, I'm focused on the sustaining and recovery efforts for any company I'm investing in right now....what will they be like in 3 months when vaccines flood the FDA for approval and normalcy has resumed....and avoiding the ones who will fall the wayside. DAL and LUV are still the only 2 airlines that give me that confidence as I've mentioned before. DAL is hopeful that it can largely avoid furloughing workers, which confirms for me they are still healthy financially overall. News about high options activity in DAL where calls outweighed puts two times to one yesterday...per the article, this implies a 7.5% move up or down between now and Friday...and the way the market is digesting the ER news for almost 2 hours now without a 'sky is falling' pullback, seems to me these options traders with calls and us longs have a better chance of seeing stability and upwards movement now. DAL's cash burn is down 70% from late March with reduced flights and costs...and sales did manage to BEAT expectations, telling me people are buying more tickets to fly on DAL than expected, so optimistic. As far as the states stepping back their phased openings, they're just closing dine-in eating, wineries, movie theaters as a safety measure....something we've all gone through already.....and it doesn't impact DAL that much, but market volatility i. We're still not on a major lockdown as before, so more fear than bite IMO. Let the shorts keep spamming...the more they do, the more you know they're afraid and things are going the way of longs.

I thought this might be a problem....”However, one airline official said major carriers may receive only about 75% of the payroll assistance sought because the total amount of funds sought exceeded $25 billion.”So let’s see. Delta needs $6B to recover the payroll, but will only get about $4.5 and $1.5 Billion is a loan...so, because they can’t lay anyone off until Sept 30, they have to cover the $6B (that’s what the average 3 month employment costs were last year. It’s not an estimate, it’s true, so don’t try to argue it’s less!) but they only get $4.5B, and $1.5B is a loan. So, to get $3B net, they have to take on an additional $3B in debt. Can their credit facility give them that? Will they allow the. Yo draw that? It takes the. From $14B in debt to $17B in debt! That’s before mai tan s costs on all the grounded airplanes they need to service because they will be back to 109% the day the shelter at place is over..wait, no, they will have to “dry dock” aircraft to make this work...because they won’t be back at 100% on day 1 and they can’t afford it!!!

2729,"Thoughts on second wave of Covid-19: Even if there is a second wave of Covid-19, which is likely with most states and US economy in some stage of reopening. With the known magnitude of economic impact of first wave, states and federal governments are unlikely to go on the path of re-closing even if second wave is as strong as first wave (which is unlikely). If and when second wave comes along, some sort of herd immunity would have been developed, testing, contact-tracing, protecting elderly/sick, and even medications (if not vaccine) will be much more advanced than the sheer unknowns and fear of the first wave. More than likely, second wave will be dealt closer to a severe flu season than the first wave of Covid-19. With no serious risk from second wave, focus will be on (a) Ability of each airlines to survive for another 6-8 months (b) how soon can be they zero cash burn with some traffic coming in, and (c) how fast can they achieve profitability. With certainty of few flights in future, pricing power will be with airlines and not the flying population. Lastly, billions of dollars airlines have accumulated with the worst of the worst possibilities in mind, will be used to strengthen their rainy day cash piles and even to boost stock price with stock buyback and dividends.

World will keep flights closed to USA as long as infection spread is high. 2) Air traffic is down 85% from last year and is trending up only very slowly. Demand will be severly depressed until a cure is out. Best case scenario is vaccine ready early next year and mass availibility by mid 2021. Plus a lot of business traffic will not come back because there is a fundamental switch taking place to remote work and tele-conferencing. This will be permanent or have at minimum a long term effect. Plus we are officially in a recession, demand would be impacted even without covid. 3) In order to make it through this airlines will need to take on a lot of new debt. Delta is already warning it must renegotiate debt by next year or face default yet they are loading up on new unsecured debt anyway at very high interest rates. Thus will have a severe impact on profitability after any recovery. 4) For any flights that are taking place, seat prices are severly depressed by about 50% on top of 30% less plane capacity for social distancing. So revenue on a per flight basis at ""full"" is about 35% pre covid. Is a full plane profitable? The answer is a clear NO!Now ask yourself how long can even a well managed and financed airline cope with this carnage and if it will survive what is residual value?All the big institutions and holders are selling to retail (aka RobinHood). So how much sway do retail investors have with goverment? When the question comes up whether to offer another bailout there will be no bigshot holder to throw their weight in the ring. Of course DAL will not go out of business. They will do chapter 11 and ownership will go from the retail holder to the big intitutional and rich bond holders.

That time American airlines doubled when they announced they would go back to a few of the 1000 routes they had cancelled lolIn other words, it rallied based on non news (One time United rallied 5% when they announced they were using Clorox lol).Just to give you a perspective, 35 would make Delta more or less 40% cheaper than its high. Kinda like Chase or Bank of America. Difference is Chase and Bank of America are getting 20% less revenue and still have profits, and dividend is safe.Delta hasnt made a cent in 5 months and has been losing money ever since. Plus their debt is 35% bigger and about to get even bigger. And the new debt is to cover losses, which is the worst type of debt.Buying this at 35 is like paying 15,000 dollars for a 2002 Corolla lolLast time airlines rallied this time I made a little fortune with American Airlines puts (if my son goes to an ivy league school the tuition is paid thanks to people that buy crippled airlines stocks).But Delta also had very cheap 35-38 dollar puts that gained +500% in 2 or 3 weeks.Dont be left holding the back.

It will take more than decade or more to get back to owning 24 worth of assets per share. In 2019 Delta paid roughly 962 million in dividends. (637 million shares x 1.51). If they hold the dividend to pay back the 17 billion in debt issuance, it will take more than 17 years.

We are moving quickly to preserve cash and protect our company. And with revenues dropping, we must be focused on taking costs out of our business. In order to do this, we are taking difficult but determined actions to protect the financial position of the company. These include: ·An overall capacity reduction in the next few months of 40 percent – the largest capacity reduction in Delta’s history, including 2001.·Elimination of flying to continental Europe for the next 30 days, which could be extended. We will maintain service to London.·Parking up to 300 aircraft as our reduced capacity requires a substantially smaller fleet.·Deferring new aircraft deliveries to manage our reduced capacity and preserve cash.·Reducing capital expenditures by at least $2 billion for the year, including delaying aircraft mods, IT initiatives and other opportunities to preserve cash.·Immediately offering voluntary short-term, unpaid leaves as well as an immediate hiring freeze.·Substantially reducing the use of consultants and contractors. We’ll be making more critical decisions on our response in days to come. The situation is fluid and likely to be getting worse. But what hasn’t changed is this: Delta remains better-positioned to weather a storm of this magnitude than ever before in our history. We’ve spent a decade building a strong, resilient airline powered by the best professionals in the business. We will get through this, and taking strong, decisive action now will ensure that we are properly positioned to recover our business when customers start to travel again.",0.9975

They should have implemented redundant sensors, located at different parts of the aircraft, and only accept those sensor readings if they all were presenting the same data. Furthermore, correcting a stall of the aircraft, which this system is intended to intervene and perform, is a basic and fundamental skill each trained pilot has the ability to address.

In order for DAL and any other airline to make profit at about 60% capacity flight fares must go up accordingly but it did not... BofC said that it expect 40% decline in GDP meaning to my understanding that a 2nd wave of market correction is upon us in the near future... all these questions the idea of holding long on DAL but as mixed rumours create vagueness in facts versus short term profit the stock now is a short term buy. If you've managed to but @ 17.5 than perhaps its a long. The US bailout bill also raises questions for DAL managment in relations to the govt.

That number is even with Government help.Delta will post a loss of at least 3 billion this quarter. It has to. TSA numbers that you guys celebrate so much still show less than 6% of the usual passengers by this time of the year in Q2. Add that to their 600 million loss in Q1, and thats being very generous. Q3 will also have a loss if the revenue is less than 50%, which it will. Add another 1.5 billion in losses. Q4 will have losses as well. Delta might see 7 billion in losses and 20 billion in more debt by the end of the year.Its time for you guys to learn what debt does to a stock. Its not too hard. Just remember the basic account equation of Assets = Liabilities + Equity.If revenue and profits go up (thats in assets) and liabilities (debt) goes down or stays the same, the stock has to go up. It just has to, soon or later since if you have more money and owe less, of course you are worth more.Well here assets have gone down and to make up for it, liabilities are going up by 20-25% a quarter. You say its priced it, but is it? Revenue still doesnt come back and even the CEOs are saying it will take years to come back. In the meantime more debt to cover expenses and worse, to cover losses.The vaccine will take longer than what you think. Companies already cancelled business trips this yr and many won't come back at all. Those were very profitable for airlines. International travel, down too. Delta is more exposed to them than smaller airlines or the almost entirely local Southwest.If you believe in Delta, wait until it crashes more.

One in 1982 and then in 2008-10. For 82 the country had had surges in unemployment since the second half of the 70s so it didnt happen overnight. The market went from 1000 to 1300 in the next 3 yrs. A 10% return yr after yr isnt bad but, as I said, the unemployment hadnt reached a +10% peak overnight. Nevertheless the recovery wasnt followed by a bull market of 15%.Then for the 2008 crisis, although there market did go up rapidly from March 2009 lows, the high of late 2007 wasnt achieved until the fall of 2012. So it took 5 yrs for the market to come back.My point is, the stock market has not had a 15% yearly returns after having huge unemployment. I dont know of any country that brings unemployment down from +15% to a healthy 5% overnight. I dont know of any country in the last 40 yrs that have solved a crisis like that in less than a few years, let alone a few months which is what the permabulls are expecting.By now we all know its due to the fed that stocks arent lower. Problem is its a double age sword. When the Government buys corporate debt it keeps them from crashing, but it keeps them from going bull. Look at Japan which their low activity when the government buys etfs and even stock. The still havent gone back to their highest level that was lost almost 30 yrs ago since when revenue comes its time to pay back the debt.

Stop watching Fox News that has an average audience thats 200 yrs old. Read international news. Read news from Spain, Italy, Germany. Many news websites have English versions. They have no idea when the flights will return and they have 1/10 of our daily cases. Olympics cancelled, international sports cancelled. China claims to have defeated the virus and they still dont have even basketball.Stop making excuses and telling yourself that people will fly again. Nobody is saying people wont fly again. What people like me are saying is that Delta for instance wont have the 4 billion a month revenue for a long time. Ed Bastian said it would take 3 yrs and what will the debt be then? 3 times higher? More debt isnt good news people. Even adjusted to shares outstanding all you have to do is look at the revenue and prices compared to a few yrs ago and its obvious that Delta is extremely overvalued.

If you cannot buy a ticket from the biggest hub in the world, to the biggest amusement park in the world - well, things are pretty awful.I would be long here, and is there a huge difference from buying at $18 versus $22 if this goes back to $42? Not really, you have still pretty much doubled your money, but now the question is not if but when you see a return.Are you a 10%er and sell or are you the kind that waits for 50% returns?

Lots of UNknown still out: 1- Will the revenue from 777 summer season pan out or will it be a failure due to low traveling.2- All these furlows (layoffs) are yet to be resolved. Will people accept early retirement or accept cut in pay ?, etc. No one really knows the answer to that yet. How will it affect their cash flow?At the end of march they show roughly 2.9 Billion in receivable( I am quite certain that number has dwindled down substantially by now. Besides that they show at march $5,9 Billion of cash (with their daily cash burn of at least 80 million a day : 90 days X 80 million= 7.2 Billion as of June 30). So no cash left with current liability due as of march of 19 Billion which includes 6.5 billion of accounts payable, now you explain to me how they solve that problem? Please someone explains it to me as if I were a 4 years old.3- On Delta reducing its daily cash burn : Will they accomplish this within he next 6 months: very doubtful.4-Will the next 6 months traffic be adequate to accomplish the 3 points above mentioned. That's a big question mark.Personally I previously owned Delta , price paid $19.60 a share. Sold it at $34.I predict Delta will go back to the low $20 before it bounces back upward.

4048,"WHAT TO EXPECT 4-1-20 through 6-30-20The company expects June quarter total expenses to decline by approximately 50%, or $5 billion, over prior year due to reduced capacity, lower fuel and cost initiatives, including:Parking more than 650 aircraft Consolidating airport facilities, with temporary concourse and Delta Sky Club closures Instituting a company-wide hiring freeze and offering voluntary leave options with 37,000 employees taking short-term unpaid leave Reducing salary expense through pay reductions for executive management and reduced work schedules across organization Balance Sheet, Cash and Liquidity Delta's top financial priority remains preserving cash and enhancing liquidity. Accordingly, the company has taken the following actions:Raised $5.4 billion of capital since early March, including securing a $3.0 billion secured term loan, closing $1.2 billion in aircraft sale leasebacks, issuing $1.1 billion in AA, A and B tranches of our 2020-1 Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (EETC), and funding $150 million in private aircraft mortgages to enhance liquidity and satisfy maturing obligations Drew down $3 billion under existing revolving credit facilities Reduced planned capital expenditures by more than $3 billion, including working with original equipment manufacturers to optimize the timing of our future aircraft deliveries and deferring aircraft mods, IT initiatives, and ground equipment refreshment Extended payment terms with airports, vendors and lessors Suspended shareholder returns, including the Company's stock repurchase program and future dividend paymentsCARES Act Relief The company expects to receive relief from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act in the following forms:Payroll support of $5.4 billion, comprised of $3.8 billion of direct relief and a $1.6 billion low-interest, unsecured 10-year loan. Delta has already received $2.7 billion of these funds and expects to receive the remainder over the next three months. As consideration, the U.S. Treasury will receive warrants to purchase over 6.5 million shares of Delta common stock at a strike price of $24.39 with a 5-year maturity Eligibility for $4.6 billion in secured loans, if the company chooses to apply and accept funds""With the significant impact of COVID-19 on Delta's revenue, we were burning $100 million per day at the end of March. Through our decisive actions, we expect that cash burn to moderate to approximately $50 million per day by the end of the June quarter,"" said Paul Jacobson, Delta's chief financial officer. ""The decade of work we put into the balance sheet to lower debt and build unencumbered assets has been critical to our success in raising capital and we expect to end the June quarter with approximately $10 billion in liquidity.""",0.9946

A total of 2104 patients were randomised to receive dexamethasone 6 mg once per day (either by mouth or by intravenous injection) for ten days and were compared with 4321 patients randomised to usual care alone. Among the patients who received usual care alone, 28-day mortality was highest in those who required ventilation (41%), intermediate in those patients who required oxygen only (25%), and lowest among those who did not require any respiratory intervention (13%). [34]The Oxford University Recovery study[35] of various drugs that could help against Covid-19 reported that it improved survival of those who had Covid-19 and were receiving oxygen or on a ventilator. For those receiving oxygen it saved one patient's life of 25 patients treated (cutting deaths by about a fifth). For those on ventilators, it saved a patient's life of 8 patients treated (cutting deaths by about a third). In particular, it seems to help in staving off the damage caused by a cytokine storm in the most severely affected patients.It has no effect on whether someone gets the virus or on the severity of the virus caught. Nor does it help those who are mildly affected by the virus, indicating that it works by treating particular symptoms rather than the virus itself.""",0.9906
