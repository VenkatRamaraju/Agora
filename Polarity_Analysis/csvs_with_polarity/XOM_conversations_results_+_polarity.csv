23,"Looks as though we're well based and have been channelized for a little while. As mentioned by others, we'll need a catalyst (most likely) to move up/down. I suspect that will be 1Q/2Q earnings and/or a clear direction on oil supply vs. demand. Odds are that 1Q earnings will come before S/D direction (though we have three EIA reports before then)... hard to imagine folks ignoring historical metrics for the stock price. I'm still calling for ~5M barrel equivalent drawdown this week's report... the demand has to manifest sometime soon. If you're wondering what to do with your holdings... just wait. There is very, very little risk to the downside and at least 10% to the upside with a solid 1Q result. I think it is fair to say we won't see $70 before 2Q, but we certainly could threaten $65 by August. Curious note... bombshell auto sales in 1Q, so there is certainly a significant amount of US latent demand, anyone's guess as to when it manifests.",0.9132

49,"So this bozo did a cashflow analysis of XOM and seems to have made a huge mistake in his cashflow assumptions. He basically ignored the cost reductions and the guidance XOM has given that every dollar in Brent is $3B in more cashflow. So using his assumptions of cashflow basically ramping from $19.8 to $20.2B by 2031 he gets a fair value of XOM at $62.54. That means some shorts had him write this article for them.Now if we instead add in the $45B a year in additional cash flow that ramps to 2025, XOM would earn $65B in cashflow in 2031 and using his analysis should be worth $364 a share.Now if we assume that $45B will be taxed so ends up only being $30B that still gets you to a fair value of $248.48 a share.Some analysis genius!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-fair-value-exxon-mobil-134338005.html",0.9575

From the article:As of today, Goldman has closed its recommendation to buy XOM call spreads, and instead has gone balls to the wall bullish, by initiating a new recommendation to buy calls outright ahead of the Mar 3rd analyst day:On Dec 15th, we recommended buying the XOM Apr-21 $45/$50 call spreads, driven by our bullish view ahead of multiple catalysts. On 20-Jan we rolled the recommendation to a higher strike at a gain. Today, with increased clarity on the company's dividend payment, and solid earnings on 02-Feb, we recommend closing the call spreads at a gain, and buying the XOM Mar-21 $52.50 calls, recently offered at $2.56 (4.8%, stock $52.85).Why is the upcoming analyst day a catalyst? Because according to Goldman, ""XOM analyst days have historically been an important catalyst, with the stock averaging +/-1.6% on the day of the event, nearly in-line with the average earnings-day move in past years."" And with one month implied volatility declining 10 points since earnings, Goldman believes ""option prices are low, and recommend investors buy calls ahead of the analyst day.""For those who care more about the fundamentals, Goldman Energy analyst Neil Mehta is Buy rated on XOM, with his bullish near-term view driven by:-Significant upside to 2021-22 Visible Alpha consensus earnings-Outlook for improving oil prices, particularly relative to the forward curve-Leverage to continued chemicals strength-Improving natural gas price fundamentals-A view that refined product demand will sharply accelerate as jet and road travel rebound",0.995

Also, in China, the recent liquidity squeeze may be over for now thereby reducing demand risks from the world’s biggest importer,” Saxo Bank strategists said on Tuesday. Going forward, the pace of Chinese imports will depend on its policies for stockpiling, considering the higher oil prices this year, and on the import tactics of the independent refiners, who typically prefer to use up the quotas ahead of the deadlines and stock up on crude. The pace of the Chinese economic growth will also play a role. In the fourth quarter, China’s economy expanded more than forecast, by 6.5 percent year over year. The full-2020 economic growth of 2.3 percent was the lowest in more than 40 years. Still, China was the only major economy to avoid economic contraction last year. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects China’s economy to grow by 8.1 percent in 2021. The forecast strong economic growth this year could further drive up Chinese oil demand, oil imports, and, eventually, global oil prices.",0.8781

One of the hardest things to do as a petroleum engineer is to forecast oil prices as part of the formula for revenue. To make it possible, oil companies go to the commodity market and sell future barrels. A maximim of 90% of what one produces, otherwise you are speculating (thanks Enron). Exxon does not get cash prices for all their production. What price are their barrels locked in at? What is the decline rate of their fields? What new wells coming on? Stimulations (acid jobs, frac jobs, water floods), new fields, risks overseas, currency, even the oil itself....not all oil gets that peak West Texas Intermediate, WTI price. Some are sour, some oils more viscous, etc... then issues with getting it to the refineries via pipelines, train, truck, ships. It’s a very complex business. The only rule of thumb we could ever come up with is buy when oil is in the dumpster for whatever reason, and sell when things look fantastic. Low prices drive up demand and high prices reduce demand. There is a lag from oil prices to stock price due to hedging mentioned above.

473,"What do you think XOM can trade at if everything falls into place? Long Term. If inflation, a commodity super cycle and developing countries all increase demand dramatically? Consider the following in regards to long term natural gas demand growth and pricing:1. On a BTU energy equivalent basis, natural gas should be about $10 compared when oil is just at $60 a barrel. Oil is higher than that already. 2. Our country really just began exporting natural gas as LNG in 2016, and capacity to export more is increasing dramatically. We already export, just via LNG, more than 10 percent of annual national production.3. Number 2 should tend to bring number 1 into reality in the long term.4. The USA is increasing exports to Mexico and Canada via more and more pipelines and export roughly the same amount of natural gas that way as we do via LNG .5. We are building more and more natural gas electric generating plants each year and this is expected to increase right through 2050 according to the US EIA. This is long term demand growth.6. Each electric vehicle will need electricity and natural gas electric generation will be very much needed to provide greater and greater electricity supply.7. Each electric vehicle may reduce the need for so much oil and thus may result in lower associated natural gas and higher gas prices. Yet at the same time even more natural gas will be needed to produce electricity for electric cars.8. Natural gas is the most efficient feedstock to produce hydrogen. Maybe the only viable feedstock.9. Bill Gates, through an investment vehicle, recently invested in technology to convert natural gas to hydrogen in a very environmentally favorable way. A possible large clean way to use natural gas.10. Numerous big companies are purchasing delivery trucks for use in the USA that run on natural gas. Amazon has recently ordered HUNDREDS of such trucks.11. Natural gas is a finite commodity with relatively inelastic demand. Not making more, but using more and more. 12. Wall Street appears to have had a serious aversion to natural gas producers in recent past. It appears this could be changing. It appears the only viable economic way towards a cleaner future for much of the world. 13. When herd mentality changes, prices can move quite impressively.Disclaimer: I do not have a position in XOM but am long HGTXU, GURE, AR and SWN all of which have natural gas interests. I may add to, or decrease, my holdings at any time. I am subject to errors of judgement and can create my own financial beatings quite well.

Really hard to gauge the true severity of the impact of 'COVID lockdowns' on current US demand as much of the demand side relief has been artificial (imposed and obfuscated by mixed reporting - i.e. real demand vs. speculative demand based on forecasts). OPEC just guided up on their 2021 demand forecasts, I think the US problem is somewhat political... which is a shame but hard to ignore. Either way, gotta believe one of two things, demand is soaring (above 2019 levels by a healthy percentage, will need airline travel to get there), or demand is stagnating (at slightly below 2019 levels throughout the FY). If the former is true, and it manifests in API/EIA reports, then look to 2018 performance and EPS for XOM's annual performance. Also, no, I don't believe Woods when he said XOM would cap production below their previous goal of ~5M bpd of equivalent for 2025 IF demand recovers to 2019+ levels by 3Q. Also, keep an eye on the CCS + 'carbon tax' play brewing... could be a gift-horse for the industry that's been working at it for years, and would be a solid revenue stream.

510,"How Exxon Could Send Its Stock Even Higher Next WeekExxon Mobil will give investors an update on its business on Wednesday, and some analysts are getting bullish ahead of the event. The narrative around Exxon (ticker: XOM) has changed dramatically in just the past two months. A company that seemed unable to adapt to the new oil market now seems to be one of Wall Street’s most compelling turnaround stories.Although the stock dropped 3.2% to $53.99 on Friday morning amid a broader market selloff that dragged oil prices lower, the shares are up 30% this year. That outpaces the 24% gain in the Energy Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund (XLE).Some analysts see a setup for more gains. “Exxon analyst day event on March 3 is viewed as a catalyst rich event,” wrote Credit Suisse analyst Manav Gupta in a research note on Friday. “While we do not expect a tectonic shift, Exxon could make multiple tweaks that would be viewed positively.”Barclays increased its target for the stock price to $65 from $59.Exxon came into the pandemic with an aggressive plan to increase production at a time when other oil companies were cutting back, seeking to reduce their capital spending in response to disappointment among investors over returns in the industry over the past decade. Wall Street now prefers oil stocks that show less production growth but return more cash to shareholders.Exxon has been changing its tune in recent weeks, reducing its operating budget and projections for capital spending. Given the spike in oil prices and those cost cuts, Exxon may be able to cover its dividend out of its cash flow for the first time in the past two years.Gupta thinks investors will want word from Exxon at next week’s meeting that it is reducing capital expenditures even more.Exxon plans to spend $20-$25 billion on capital expenses through 2025, but “bulls are hopeful the company could be persuaded to lower capex to $18-$20 billion,” Gupta wrote. “This would provide for greater dividend safety as well as faster pace of debt reduction, driving re-rating and dividend yield normalization (5.5% versus current 6.2%).”",0.9747
511,"Interesting to read the board here. Obviously there are some naysayers that never let the facts get in the way of a bad story. XOM cutback last week and saved a fortune on power at a time when the grid value for electricity was at a premium. That was a great move. Obviously Texan drivers are not known for their snow and ice driving. Refineries are animals that require annual maintenance and there is not a better time to start that but when you are already down. You may see a slight pull back in crude, but judging the traffic I m seeing everywhere you should see demand take off again. Gas prices are up 15 cents per gallon and will continue to rise as we come out of the pandemic. The reduction in crude production will be offset by the reduction in driving demand. Should keep the market fairly balanced. There was 5+ million barrels a day of refining capacity out of service last week.

Refinery inputs were well over 2M bpd less than pre Covid levels, which are normally about 17M bpd. The weekly change in oil and refined product was a net 500k drawdown, so less supplies. 5 year averages remain similar with crude slightly above the mid-range, distillate also at the mid-range and gasoline and propane still at the bottom quartile. Supplies are thus tight.Demand wasn't strong and refining wasn't either, if either had been we would have seen significantly more drawdowns of products and oil. I think we are still in a situation that as demand rebounds to pre-Covid levels over the next few weeks we are going to be running out of product fairly quickly. It will be an interesting summer, especially as US production of crude remains 2M bpd below pre-Covid levels and that likely will continue for some time.",-0.8616

Goldman raised its Brent forecasts by $10 a barrel, to $70 next quarter and $75 in the following three months.“This faster re-balancing during what was expected to be the dark days of winter will be followed by a widening deficit this spring as the ramp-up in OPEC+ production lags our above-consensus demand recovery forecast,” bank analysts including Damien Courvalin said in",0.7928

Even though WTI prices have tanked nearly $10 from the high of $68 a few weeks ago, we've held strong near prices in designated ranges -- why is that? Because we're ALL still undervalued, and sharks know it.All of our oilers are profitting MORE than enough at WTI anywhere above $55, let alone even in the $60s. Let me give a soft reminder of 5Y historical price history weighted against WTI prices for each ticker:On Dec 2nd, 2016, the prices for each ticker were as follows:$CPE 172.40 (17.24 pre-RS)$CDEV 18.06$MRO 18.20$OXY 70.85$XOM 87.04Likewise, on that date on Dec 2nd, 2016, Crude WTI prices closed at a mere $51.68 per barrel.Yet, all of these tickers are way lower than those prices despite much higher sentiment and WTI prices. So, one word: UNDERVALUED. What's inevitable, we know, is that the world WILL open back up -- the only matter is when.

Last year, Bloomberg reported that Chinese state giants China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) were interested in buying ExxonMobil’s entire operating stake in West Qurna 1. The stake sale could be worth at least US$500 million, reports had it at the time.Last month, Bloomberg reported that Exxon was considering selling its stake in West Qurna 1 as it looks to cut its debts, which grew in 2020 with the collapse in oil prices, while the supermajor looks to keep its dividend intact.The Iraqi government could now end up buying Exxon’s interest, the oil minister of OPEC’s second-largest producer behind Saudi Arabia said on Monday. A potential acquisition would be made via the Iraqi state-held Basra Oil Company, the minister added. ExxonMobil signed in 2010 an agreement with the South Oil Company of the Iraq Ministry of Oil to rehabilitate and redevelop the West Qurna I field in southern Iraq. Exxon is the lead contractor, while a Royal Dutch Shell affiliate also held a stake under the 2010 agreement.In 2018, Shell sold its stake in West Qurna 1 to Japan’s Itochu Corporation. The Japanese firm currently holds 19.6 percent in the oilfield. Apart from Itochu and the lead contractor Exxon, the other shareholders in West Qurna 1 are PetroChina with 32.7 percent, Indonesia’s Pertamina with 10 percent, and Oil Exploration Company with 5 percent.Speaking to reporters today, the oil minister also said that Iraq sees oil prices staying around $65 per barrel in the near term.",0.9903

April Brent crude, the global benchmark, was last seen up US$0.41 to US$61.50 while Western Canada Select was down US$0.23 to US$47.27 per barrel.In its weekly report on U.S. oil inventories, supply and demand, the Energy Information Administration said inventories last week fell by 6.6 million barrels last week, while it was it was expected to report a rise of 0.4 million barrels.""Crude Oil storage has been lower for three weeks in a row. Incredibly, the refinery utilization rate was up 0.70% points to 83.0% of capacity, the highest level for the run rate since a 87.3% print in the week to March 20, 2020. Generally speaking, the refinery utilization rate tends to slide at this time of year as turnaround season takes hold of refining margins,"" Robert Yawger, director of energy futures for Mizuho Securities USA, said in a note,Prices have climbed 60% since the beginning of November as the market grows more comfortable with OPEC+ supply discipline while awaiting a rebound in demand as vaccination programs continue.""A well-coordinated and implemented strategy of voluntary production cuts on the part of OPEC+ is chiefly responsible for the justified optimism on the supply side.

1213,"JP Morgan Quant Expert predicts Secular Bull Market in oil companies driven by algorithm initiated short squeeze in March 2021JPM quant trading and valuation experts Marko Kolanovic predicts the next 12 years will be the most profitable era for oil investors in the past 100 years due to inflation, the weakening US Dollar (caused by stimulus), a booming stimulus-driven recovery, and under-investment in oil production caused by environmental concerns.The fundamentals will be compounded by automatic trading by algorithm driven super-fast traders called Quants. The market will begin automatically rebalancing out of short positions in mid-March due to the recent rise in energy company stocks, oil prices and excess liquidity.The best picks to cash in on this cycle are $OXY, $XOM, $CVX, $ET, $ERX & $XLE. The following is an excerpt from his article. Quants and Momentum InvestingIn a market where algos and trend-followers have emerged as one of the dominant price-setting forces, it is hardly a surprise that the JPM quant focuses on their influence as the driver behind a commodity supercycle. Indeed, he writes that after ""CTAs played significant role in the 2014 oil price downturn"" more recently, ""CTA funds have been adding Energy exposure. The reason is that 12-month momentum turned positive on Oil, and going forward signals will remain solidly positive."" And since vol-control funds are some of the dumbest money around and their actions can be anticipated well in advance, JPM notes that ""a further decline in volatility will likely result in larger and more stable cross-asset quant allocations. A larger momentum impact may affect Energy equities, which is the only sector that still has a strongly negative momentum signal and is hence heavily shorted in the context of factor investing."" That, JPMorgan believes, will ""change in mid-March, when the momentum signal for energy equities turns positive"" which may be a hint to the redditors out there: if you want to squeeze the systematic shorts, do it where it hurts and buy some energy stocks to crush the CTAs. You have about a month to do so because JPM's model momentum factor ""will need to rebalance in March by closing ~20% of its allocation to Energy equity shorts, and adding ~2% to energy longs, for a ~22% net buying in Energy.""What is the quantitative significance of these flows? Kolanovic calculates that if one roughly assumes that there is about ~$1Tr in equity long-short quant funds and that half of these funds are not sector neutralized, ""the flows could be quite significant, roughly $20-$30bn."" As shown in the chart below, the ratio of energy shares shorted vs all other S&P 500 shares shorted, closely followed the commodity supercycle. Remarkably, most recently the number of shares shorted for energy was 4 times the S&P 500 average (note that given the decline of the sector’s weight, energy share prices declined, and the effective $ amount shorted was only 2 times larger). In other words, one doesn't even need to squeeze the shorts: come March - absent some major new crisis - as a result of broader market technicals the prevailing shorts will close them out on their own and go long.Another ""flow factor"" behind the ""supercycle"" is rotation by discretionary funds and retail: In the period from 2010 to 2015, the Energy sector had a 10.6% allocation in conventional equity portfolios. Since then, this has declined to a 3.1% weight currently (Figure 4). The largest decline was in active allocations, which declined from 7% to 1.5% (while passive allocations decreased from 3.6% to 1.8%), which is understandable - investors dumped ""dead stocks"" to chase growth and momentum, but the tide is now turning, and ""any retracement of this decline, on a US equity fund asset base of ~$14T would result in significant inflows and re-pricing."" According to Kolanovic, as economies reopen, inflation moves higher, and yield curves steepen, active funds are expected to first close cyclical shorts, and then rotate from long secular growth towards value and cyclicals. His next point is critical: given that equity assets significantly increased over the last 10 years, and the energy sector significantly decreased, even a small rotation could produce an outsized move.",0.9834

Oil is about 1/3 of my portfolio.Royal Dutch Shell to Exxon Mobil ratio for me is 14 RDS to 1 XOM.Royal Dutch Shell cut its dividend by about 66% (2/3) and for RDS it will be easy to pay the dividend and at the same time do some small investments in this time where cash is king. XOM can very likely still pay the dividend, but it will not make any investments. For myself I wanted to diversify my oil position and I bought XOM at 42 USD; I kept extending my positions in Royal Dutch Shell, because even though recently XOM declined more I think the underlying value for Royal Dutch Shell is higher and it has a lot more upside when oil recovers. Also Shell is taking more action to get a greener image and their goal is carbon neutral by 2050 if I'm not mistaken.

This means there was no supply build due to a lack of demand and you see this clearly when you sum the four products, with supply builds in oil, gasoline and distillates (small) more than offset by massive declines in propane.

1502,"I want to share a news that came out an hour ago. The U.S. now produces jaw dropping 132 million vaccine doses per month and the number is continuing to increase. Compare that number with Feb where the U.S. was only able to produce 48 million doses. Whether you like it or not, the U.S. will be able to produce more than enough vaccine until the end of May for almost all adults in the U.S.. Based on the data and the number of new cases from Israel, we can probably concur that vaccines DO work. I believe that things will start to return to normal by mid June to July at the latest in the U.S. even if there is any hiccup. It is inevitable that the total EU population of 443 million people would also be vaccinated by the end of August or September. Variants don't really matter. If the U.S. can produce 135 million to 200 million doses per month we can easily come up with a single booster dose with mRNA vaccine. So... why are you worrying over 9% drop in oil price because of new lockdown in Europe? I own oxy stock not exxon. But even I am aware that Exxon stock should be around $65-70 at minimum even at the current oil price. I am going to focus on my work and business until June.

Whether you do that for a month to prematurely buy your shares with the payout or go for Jan 2022 or Jan 2023 leaps is up to you. I think XOM will see a price peak in 2022 ""if"" oil tops then and pulls back. If oil just steadily grinds higher, well XOM will benefit from those cost reductions through 2025 to improve earnings.Of course you could also sell you stock at what you think is the low and then play for a quick rebound and buy deep in the money calls for a few months out, the premium will be low so if the stock recovers to recent highs you would have a sizable gain to boot.

1518,"So there are some Covid scares going on, especially in Europe, as a new strain is wrecking havoc on the positive tested numbers. The overall world trend us up again for example. However, there is good news, the vaccines are working and you can finally see it in the Israel data:https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/israel/They started to ramp up vaccinations early this year and by the end of January had a significant population immunized, by the end of February man had received even their second dose. This all sets up for Israel to start showing significant impacts of the vaccine around the middle of March. Looking at the data in the link above that is exactly what we see, now Israel is really in a sizable decline in infections and deaths. The reason for the rise in infections in February was likely that people just felt more comfortable going out because of the vaccinations in general, not because they had taken full effect yet. This bodes well for the US and the UK which are doing a good job of getting those most at risk vaccinated. Even Europe isn't doing as poorly as it seems as they are around 10% vaccinations but this likely includes the majority of those who are really at risk of death, those 65 and older which in the US account for ~85% of the deaths.All of this should result in lower deaths going forward and as deaths drop, the virus becomes more of a non event as with vaccination the fatality rate starts to drop even below the flu for higher age groups.",-0.4605

1522,"Interesting news for the energy sector going forward.JP Morgan Quant Expert predicts Secular Bull Market in oil companies driven by algorithm initiated short squeeze in March 2021JPM quant trading and valuation experts Marko Kolanovic predicts the next 12 years will be the most profitable era for oil investors in the past 100 years due to inflation, the weakening US Dollar (caused by stimulus), a booming stimulus-driven recovery, and under-investment in oil production caused by environmental concerns.The fundamentals will be compounded by automatic trading by algorithm driven super-fast traders called Quants.The market will begin automatically rebalancing out of short positions in mid-March due to the recent rise in energy company stocks, oil prices and excess liquidity.The best picks to cash in on this cycle are $OXY, $XOM, $CVX, $ET, $ERX & $XLE.The following is an excerpt from his article.Quants and Momentum InvestingIn a market where algos and trend-followers have emerged as one of the dominant price-setting forces, it is hardly a surprise that the JPM quant focuses on their influence as the driver behind a commodity supercycle. Indeed, he writes that after ""CTAs played significant role in the 2014 oil price downturn"" more recently, ""CTA funds have been adding Energy exposure. The reason is that 12-month momentum turned positive on Oil, and going forward signals will remain solidly positive.""And since vol-control funds are some of the dumbest money around and their actions can be anticipated well in advance, JPM notes that ""a further decline in volatility will likely result in larger and more stable cross-asset quant allocations. A larger momentum impact may affect Energy equities, which is the only sector that still has a strongly negative momentum signal and is hence heavily shorted in the context of factor investing.""That, JPMorgan believes, will ""change in mid-March, when the momentum signal for energy equities turns positive"" which may be a hint to the redditors out there: if you want to squeeze the systematic shorts, do it where it hurts and buy some energy stocks to crush the CTAs. You have about a month to do so because JPM's model momentum factor ""will need to rebalance in March by closing ~20% of its allocation to Energy equity shorts, and adding ~2% to energy longs, for a ~22% net buying in Energy.""What is the quantitative significance of these flows? Kolanovic calculates that if one roughly assumes that there is about ~$1Tr in equity long-short quant funds and that half of these funds are not sector neutralized, ""the flows could be quite significant, roughly $20-$30bn."" As shown in the chart below, the ratio of energy shares shorted vs all other S&P 500 shares shorted, closely followed the commodity supercycle.Remarkably, most recently the number of shares shorted for energy was 4 times the S&P 500 average (note that given the decline of the sector’s weight, energy share prices declined, and the effective $ amount shorted was only 2 times larger). In other words, one doesn't even need to squeeze the shorts: come March - absent some major new crisis - as a result of broader market technicals the prevailing shorts will close them out on their own and go long.Another ""flow factor"" behind the ""supercycle"" is rotation by discretionary funds and retail: In the period from 2010 to 2015, the Energy sector had a 10.6% allocation in conventional equity portfolios. Since then, this has declined to a 3.1% weight currently (Figure 4). The largest decline was in active allocations, which declined from 7% to 1.5% (while passive allocations decreased from 3.6% to 1.8%), which is understandable - investors dumped ""dead stocks"" to chase growth and momentum, but the tide is now turning, and ""any retracement of this decline, on a US equity fund asset base of ~$14T would result in significant inflows and re-pricing.""According to Kolanovic, as economies reopen, inflation moves higher, and yield curves steepen, active funds are expected to first close cyclical shorts, and then rotate from long secular growth towards value and cyclicals. His next point is critical: given that equity assets significantly increased over the last 10 years, and the energy sector significantly decreased, even a small rotation could produce an outsized move.",0.9839

1568,Great article by Investopedia on XOM. When you look at their analysis of the XOM revenues you see that XOM is structured mainly for Downstream revenues. These revenues have an extreme upside in the months to come. I have seen firsthand XOMs extreme focus on cost cutting and efficiency. The economy will open rapidly. I was in a CVS store yesterday and they were asking customers if anyone wants a vaccine injection. They had several appointments available. It will be interesting to see the next few weeks as the economy gains strength. Perhaps a return to $60+ will slow down the so called experts clowning these message boards. I will hold my 6% return wait for the uptick.,0.943
1569,"Things to bear in mind when contemplating XOM stock: 1) Like it or not, oil is around to stay at least for the next 20 years. 2) The price of CRUDE OIL is NOT the bottom line for an integrated company like XOM. XOM enjoys the benefit of selling the refined products (increased margins per barrel of oil) There is a large population of drilled - uncompleted wells (DUC's) which will maintain downward pressure on oil for the next year. Excepting an unforeseen interuption, crude oil prices should continue to wander between $45/bbl - $65/bbl for the next year or so. 3) More profit (margin is made) on refined products when the price of crude oil is low. (lower prices = more demand of finished products) 3) Their asset base is a necessary basis for modern society - even if society rolled back to a technological stage present 50 years ago. (gas engines/diesel engines can run without a sophisticated internet and computer system - we DEPEND upon them in our modern society) 4) XOM has the ability to survive lower prices of oil when other companies cannot. 5) XOM pays a handsome dividend 6) XOM has a more realistic PE ratio than most companies. 7) XOM is a global player. Foreign leaders want XOM in their countries to create jobs and wealth. 8) USA is NOT energy independent. Yes, horizontal drilling has improved our energy balance, but by no metric are we energy independent. 9) I believe it belongs in a diversified portfolio. The company had well defined business metrics and an easily defined product. We can live without the newest cell phone, but we cannot survive long without fuel.Disclosure - I am long on XOM. I am a retired oil/gas company executive (not XOM) - oil/gas exploration and production. XOM is respected by its peers. I encourage long-term thinking.",0.9923

Furthermore, over the course of one year, did the earth, plants, animals, and humans not survive an approximate yearly temperature change of about +/- 35 degrees C?Now I must ask. Why would the earth, plants, animals, and humans not survive a nominal change of 3 degrees C over the course of one or two decades?I must relate this to our investments in XOM or any other business where essentially the product sold produces CO2, and hence changes our world temperature (not definitively proved!). Here's the point. If we have approximately 300 business CEOs proclaiming that the world must discontinue the use of fossil fuels which ultimately produce CO2, I must question the critical thinking capabilities of these CEOs. Simply as a matter of the basic premise I outlined early in this topic. The fact is that discontinuing the use of fossil fuels will place large numbers of humans in poverty and perhaps death is where I certainly question the lack of critical thinking skills of these 300 CEOs.",-0.7354

I want to enjoy my weekend.To all of our Green Deal EV lovers.Good luck on your summer family road trip as you wait in line to charge your vehicle.... let's see... 30 minutes in line at the Interstate watering hole... another 30-45 to charge once you get a charger. Then answer the kids' incessant ""Are we there yet? questions. Oh and tell the kids and wife there'll be no AC because it uses too much juice. Gonna be a great, peaceful trip!! Double the time of you trip if you are lucky. Oh...and let's make sure that hotel has a charging station for every guest. I'll tell my wife ""Don't worry, honey... There's a charging station 20 minutes from here. I'll be right back in a couple of hours after I charge the car."" Opps... Damn... Three of the five charging stations are out of order (I've seen this in LA). Come on, man! Oh… and if you live in a cold climate, good luck fast charging that car at -5 degrees for 40 minutes. Don’t forget to put the heat on really low to conserve juice. And for those that have to park on the street in front of their homes, how will recharging work there?Shoot! I forgot to plug in the car last night… now what? Where’s that back-up battery? Oh…There is none. Today the batteries are warranted for 8-10 years and replacement batteries average around 5K. I am sure a 10-year-old battery doesn’t hold a full charge… so be prepared for more charges at shorter intervals as the car gets older. And does anyone want to buy a used electric car with its original battery?Lots of EV fans like to compare our situation to Europe. We are not Europe, which has an extensive, efficient public transport system divided into small, convenient “nation-states.” The US is a huge country and we love our cars.. For most of us, they represent freedom of movement and independence. If our world literally shrinks due to EV limitations I suspect that there will be considerable market push-back. And if EVs are imposed upon us like California has done (supposedly by 2035) the market will get interesting. I suggest Californians move to Texas… It’ll most certainly be the last state to go electric, if that’s the political endgame. So now…imagine a typical two-hour trip to a summer place at the mountains, shore or lake that becomes an anxiety ridden 4 hour family adventure due to charging waits and speed limitations. Then there is the issue of the hundreds of charging stations that will lie dormant in the winter at the seashore resort when few visit. Who’s going to make that investment in charging stations there? When we are forced to drive at 50-55 mph on a long trip to conserve battery power, how will that work? Let’s see… if I make the 250 mile trip at 55-60 mph I can do it with a single charge at mile 200… a total of around 5.5 hours including an optimistic charging time and charging station availability (a huge variable).. But, hey, if I go 45 mph I can also do it without an enroute charge.. also a total of 5.5 hours. Forget 75-80 mph trip I could have made in 3.5 hours at 70 mph. And just imagine the summer bottle-necks at the Interstate watering holes as you wait in the 15-car-line for your 40 minute plug-in. May as well put in a theme park at those places for the kids. They’ll have plenty of time to enjoy it.I have a friend with a Tesla. He absolutely loves it! But… he takes his other car on any round trip over 150 miles.The overwhelming challenge of EVs will be not with the technology, but with the huge cultural market acceptance and resistance issues. I fear it won’t be a smooth ride despite EVs purported green benefits. The widespread imposition of EVs will be a hugely expensive political nightmare and at least initially, lead to severe economic consequences. Hang in there XOM. You’re gonna be alright.",0.9995

1790,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices dropped sharply on Tuesday, with U.S. prices sliding back toward $20 a barrel, as investors bet that fuel demand destruction caused by the coronavirus pandemic would be too much for producers embarking on record global output cuts to offset.Global oil-producing nations are expected to reduce production by as much as 19.5 million barrels per day, but those cuts are being implemented slowly and in some cases will not start for weeks. By contrast, demand plunged by roughly 30% worldwide several weeks ago, causing refiners and producers suddenly stuck with oil to stick it into rapidly filling storage.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled at $20.11 a barrel, down $2.30 or 10.3%, as one prominent pipeline executive told Texas regulators that storage would be filled by mid-May.WTI is not far from where markets traded prior to a rally founded on hopes for the OPEC+ production deal inked over the weekend.Brent crude futures fell $2.14, or 6.7%, to settle at $29.60 a barrel.Both benchmarks are down more than 50% down this year.Analysts have praised Saudi Arabia and other major producers for cutting output, but those producers are playing catch-up to the free-fall in demand.Plains All American Pipeline President Harry Pefanis underscored that point at a hearing in Texas on Tuesday, saying that U.S. storage would be filled by mid-May.""We can't act as a storage facility for everybody that doesn't have a market,"" Pefanis said at a Texas Railroad Commission hearing, where regulators are considering a cut in state production.The bulk of the mandated reductions come from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+. That group agreed this weekend to cut output by 9.7 million bpd in May and June. The rest from the United States, Canada and others, will come as a result of weak pricing and happen over time.""With demand destruction forecasts ranging from 15 million to 22 million bpd in April 2020 and these measures not even coming into place until May, we are likely to see a substantial overhang in the short-term,"" said Nitesh Shah, director of research at New York-based WisdomTree Investments.As a result, physical markets where crude is traded, such as in Houston or London, suggest prices will not recover for a while as storage fills.U.S. crude inventories rose 13.1 million barrels in the week to April 10 to 486.9 million barrels, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed on Tuesday. Analysts had expected a build of 11.7 million barrels, after stocks climbed by a record 15.2 million barrels the previous week.",0.9907

In my honest opinion, we should already be in the $50-$60 range with these oil prices, perhaps it'll be priced in closer to our next earnings report. On top of this, consider the fact that OPEC just edited their outlook for 2021 oil demand, stating it is projected to be HIGHER in mbpd comparatively to previous reports, though they lowered short term targets due to Europe shutting down again. To me, this signals we're going to break out to new highs in the $75 WTI range on the same news that's been crashing us -- you heard it here first, headlines will read 'Oil bullish on European reopening,' as OPEC and Sauds also have it all in their best interest to hike up oil prices since American energy independence is a thing of the past.

More than a million barrels a day of oil and 10B cubic feet of gas production have also gone offline, sending U.S. crude prices above $60 a barrel for the first time in more than year and natural gas prices up 6%. Pipelines have also declared force majeure, while massive refineries owned by Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) have halted production, threatening to reduce supplies of gasoline and diesel across the country. • The energy crisis is not the only problem, with the frigid weather expected to remain through Wednesday. All air travel in and out of Houston was shut, and COVID vaccination efforts faced potential disruption, with city officials racing to administer doses before they go bad. The National Guard was also mobilized to get the elderly into warming shelters, while the power disruption spilled over into neighboring Mexico. • Backdrop: The cold snap is testing Texas's highly decentralized electricity model. Power plants don't have incentive to build reserve capacity, but are rather paid for the energy that they sell. On Monday, wholesale prices for electricity on the Texas grid even reached the price cap of $9,000 per megawatt hour (the average price is $25). Unlike utility monopolies in other states, electricity retailers in Texas compete fiercely for customer business and often tie prices to market conditions, but this has left generators worried about sending out skyrocketing bills. • Thought bubble: Storage and backup power will need to be addressed as grids across the U.S. change over from fossil fuels to cleaner energy. Competition from heavily subsidized wind power and cheaper natural gas, combined with stricter emissions regulation, has seen coal's share of Texas's electricity fall by more than half in the last decade to 18%. Meanwhile, wind's share has tripled to about 25% since 2010 and accounted for 42% of power last week, but those turbines froze yesterday as the cold weather set in. It also froze natural gas wells and interrupted supply to power plants.",0.9933

We plan to incorporate the latest results into ourforecast but do not expect a material change to our fairvalue estimate or narrow moat rating.Exxon returned to generating free cash flow during thequarter, as $4.5 billion in operating cash flow and proceedsfrom asset sales exceeded $3.8 billion in investments. Freecash flow was insufficient to cover $3.7 billion of quarterlydividends, though, requiring use of cash on hand andincreasing net debt even though gross debt fell slightly.Leverage remains manageable, however. The sustainabilityof the dividend remains the key near-term question forExxon shareholders as continued share price decline hasthe yield just under 11%. Management reiterated thedividend but did without any growth this year, keeping thequarterly payout at $0.87 a share.The dividend appears safe for now, with managementstressing its commitment to providing a reliable growingdividend. It believes that the dividend is safe through 2021with its latest capital plan (reduction in capital spendingto $16 billion-$19 billion) and operating expensereductions without increasing debt, assuming a recoveryin market conditions for oil and gas prices and refining andchemical margins to the low level of the past 10 years.During the third quarter, oil prices were slightly belowthose levels, while natural gas prices and downstreammargins were well below those levels.

1897,"For ""Capital Investors"" that believe XOM will be higher that 42 sometime in the next 16 MONTHS. Might I suggest looking into LEAPS (longer term options): If you don't understand options, these are not that complicated: Let me explain:Currently the Jan 2022 (16 months out), 32.50 Calls are going for about 10.50 to Buy. That means the breakeven point is about 43 (roughly 7.5% above the current stock price).For demonstration purposes, when the stock gets to 45 (which it did only 3 wks ago), the Calls will have an Intrinsic Value of 12.50, and depending on how much time is left before Jan 2022, some Time Value. For this we'll say they have 1.50. So the Calls will be valued at 14.00 or roughly 33% higher, with the stock only have to go up 12.5% (40 to 45). What makes this even more attractive, is that you only have to invest 25% of what would be needed to buy the same amount of stock (1 Contract equals 100 shares). So in this example, your cost to buy 1 Call Contract would be 1,050, plus comm., compared to 4k to buy the stock.Now I realize that a lot of people buy XOM for the dividend. If that's the case, then this is not the play, as Option investors do not get the dividend. That's why I said ""Capital Investors"".Just something to think about.

CARES Act Tax Loophole: $3.2 Billion to at Least 50 Publicly Traded CompaniesA tax loophole snuck into the CARES Act has allowed dozens of oil companies and contractors—including very large corporations—to receive billions of dollars in combined write-offs. Unlike the PPP, the tax provision includes no requirements on companies that take advantage of it, such as retaining workers, and many of these companies later shed jobs (detailed below). In a newly proposed stimulus bill, House Democrats included several mechanisms to scale back this tax loophole.Jesse Coleman, senior researcher at Documented, dug through the US Securities and Exchange Commission filings of publicly traded companies, identifying for Sierra more than 50 oil and gas companies that took the tax benefit. The provision loosened rules governing how businesses deduct net operating losses. The write-off is equally available to the privately held companies that abound in the oil and gas sector, but there is no requirement that they make their taxes publicly available.Marathon Petroleum Corporation took a whopping $1.1 billion tax write-off using the measure. Marathon Oil (previously the parent company of Marathon Petroleum) received an $89 million write-off. Occidental, one of Colorado’s largest oil and gas producers, took $195 million in tax write-offs. Denver-based Liberty Oilfield Services received a $9.3 million tax refund. Other large companies that took advantage of the loophole include Valero ($117 million), Devon ($98 million), and Superior ($30 million).",0.9768

Cash Flow of $7.2bn, before working capital caused the debate over whether XOM beat street expectations: with consensus cash flow at $4.5bn. However, the controversy comes in when you consider if trading gains should also be stripped out of earnings. The analyst stated ""net income is within sight of XOM’s ‘clean’ declared earnings of $2.27bn. But when examining how other oils treat the same issue the short answer is all treat it as part of ongoing operations. We stand by the conclusions reached in our initial response to XOM’s earnings: XOM beat street expectations of EPS with ‘clean’ earnings of $0.53/sh"". He went on to state ""This was probably the best operating quarter XOM has delivered in three years with momentum building in upstream capacity and cost reductions showing up in Chemicals and downstream. That it has leaned on its balance sheet, at advantaged rates to sustain spending on key strategic growth projects makes sense not least given then low relative leverage held through the cycle. Certainly XOM will burn cash; but rather than being unique to XOM, all major oils are now in the same position. The difference is XOM retains significant flexibility to reduce spending; but in a recovery, it will have the growth capacity to support rapid debt reduction not available to many of its peers"".",0.9948

2141,"The article on Yahoo that was just posted about 10 hours ago is bull hockey. It's trying to persuade you into thinking that Exxon is going to have to scale down it's business and eventually go away. That's simply not the case. At least not for ""several decades."" Take it from wise investors. Be smart, don't fall for propaganda from so called news outlets.From Dylan Grice:The energy transition is real, but it’s moving at a glacial pace. The annual Electric Vehicle Outlook summary by Bloomberg projects that EVs will only make up around 8% of the total fleet of passenger cars by 2030. The number of cars is expected to rise from today’s 1.2 billion vehicles to 1.4 billion, but only about 110 million of them will be EVs. So the number of internal combustion engine vehicles by then will be around 1.3 billion, which implies a forecast rise of around 0.7% per year. Moreover, while passenger vehicles contribute around 60% of the global demand for crude oil, the rest comes from heavy duty vehicles, aviation and the petrochemicals industry for which there are, as yet, few alternatives. I’m not saying that this is something I’m particularly happy about, but my job is to allocate capital according to the way the world is, not according to the way I want the world to be. Oil will continue to play a central role in the global economy for decades.So we're talking about a misperception of the market?The market was behaving as if oil was dead. But it won’t be, not for a long time. A second important fact is that the energy transition is a risk which is widely recognized and understood. No manager in the oil business is under any delusion about the reality of the industry. Hence they are scaling down the ambitiousness of their investment projects. A squeeze is coming.Yet more and more investors won’t touch the fossil energy sector anymore. What do you make of this?It just makes me more bullish. Oil has been starved of capital, the whole mantra of the industry is that they are not going to grow anymore, they preserve cash and return it to shareholders. Even the American shale producers, who easily have the worst track record when it comes to capital allocation, have got this new religion. This is a bull market in the making. It’s just obvious.You don’t see the risk of a permanent ESG discount in energy stocks?I want to live in a clean world, I want my kids to live in a clean world, I want to see a decarbonized world. I have enormous sympathy for the whole ESG thing. But I also happen to think that as an investor, you can’t serve two masters at once. Tobacco is a good example: It became clear in the seventies that smoking causes cancer. It became known that the tobacco companies had been lying about studies, they had been dreadful and corrupt. Suppose you had refused to invest in tobacco stocks back then. On an ethical scorecard, you’ve managed to signal your virtue to everyone. But as an investor, you missed out on a compound return of 20% per year over the next four decades. Tobacco was the best investment during those decades, and the reason for that was because it traded at such a deep discount to fair value because people had moral qualms about purchasing it. And by the way, refusing to own tobacco stocks didn’t stop people from smoking.So big oil is what big tobacco was in the seventies?It’s an analogy, and we shouldn’t stretch it too far. The fact is, despite all the capital that’s going to electric vehicles, and despite the crazy stock market valuation of these companies, they are probably not even going to be 10% of the entire stock of on-road passenger vehicles in ten years time. Which means demand for oil is going to grow. I personally happen to think that this is bad for our planet, and I don’t want to fund these companies. But if I go and buy oil drillers, or if I buy Exxon, if I buy their shares on the secondary market, I haven’t given them any money. The people who use oil have funded them, by driving cars, flying in planes and using plastics. That’s the problem to be addressed. An investor purchasing shares of oil companies in the secondary market isn’t.",0.996

Note demand last year was just 14.85M bpd which means almost 1M of other products gets produced in a day.

Supposedly we had 4M bpd shuttered in for several days, you should notice that in a drop in inventories. Then we need to focus on the refineries, first how much capacity did we end the week with since 2M bpd is offline for quite some time supposedly, you should be able to see that in the Wednesday EIA report.So by Wednesday we should be able to see the impact and likely figure refining will be off-line for weeks to come. That will make supplies of gas and diesel tight as well as continuing to reduce overall petroleum supplies even if crude production rebounds. We have a further major issue in that refiners supposedly retired 1M bpds of capacity last year due to the collapse of the market, that might not be coming back which means by the end of March it might be abundantly clear that we are going to be desperately low of refined products. $4 gas this summer is becoming a possibility, even my memorial day.As to XOM, they will take a hit from shuttering their 2 refineries for weeks but higher oil prices might well have offset that this quarter.

Brent crude moved about the same as WTI, but again, Exxon is trapped in the $75 to $76 range. Exxon has to make a move higher at some point. Exxon is not over priced with the reliable dividend it pays that is around 5% (4.74%) & the quality of the 'world class' offshore Guyana discoveries, and significant LNG reserves yet to be produced in Mozambique offshore, but proven up via previous drilling and testing to verify the large extent of natural gas which is what the world will be utilizing in the future for power generation & electricity. I guess, be patient and collect the strong and ever increasing dividend from Exxon which increase every year for the past 38 years and pays a steady dividend for over 100 years. Sure would like to see Exxon break out here. Exxon has some exceptionally great LNG projects that it is in the process of getting on line. The biggest IMHO is the offshore Guyana 13 separate field discoveries which have recoverable reserves of 5.8 billion barrels of very good quality oil. This play alone will produce 750,000 bopd when fully developed. 1st oil is coming online in a record breaking time period - year end 2019, or earlier 2020. The 5.8 billion bopd would produce at 750,000 bopd for 22+ years not considering new fields which will materialize. These are world class discoveries, and there are numerous other fields to be discovered/drilled on the Guyana block that Exxon has.

The company has since indicated it is evaluating potentially big cuts to spending, having suffered a credit-rating downgrade from Standard & Poor’s in the meantime. But details are yet to come, and Chevron’s move leaves Exxon looking flat-footed.Exxon now yields more purely on its dividend, but that indicates higher stress. Forecasts for 2020 are in flux to say the least. Still, using Ebitda as a proxy for cash from operations, current consensus figures imply Chevron needing to borrow a little to cover capex and payouts and Conoco covering from cash flow. Both have strong balance sheets. Exxon, on the other hand, has been borrowing or selling assets to cover dividends for a while. And consensus forecasts indicate cash flow won’t cover capex, let alone the roughly $15 billion dividend payout.Despite Tuesday morning’s bounce in oil prices, the market still faces the prospect of storage potentially being maxed out within a couple of months or so — which would precipitate a further crash. It is, therefore, perhaps too early to speculate on which oil stocks offer relative safety and gains on the other side of this crisis. Yet Chevron’s and Conoco’s yields, post spending cuts, look relatively robust. Chevron's stock is up 17% as of writing this. Exxon’s yield may be higher, but the Band-Aid hasn’t come off yet.",0.9374

He invited me to his office and we had an interesting conversation (this was 35 years ago). He told me that ARCO was a ""vertically integrated company."" This meant that they were involved in upstream and downstream. He said that exploration was a key to their future, and that they pumped oil, refined oil, and sold gas (along with a bunch of other stuff that they sold at AM/PM mini markets). He was regarded as one of the best CEO's in the business. What I learned in that conversation is that all segments are important, and that's why I invested in XOM. Whatever happens tomorrow is whatever happens tomorrow. But I'm sticking with this fully vertically integrated company.

2644,"Exxon announced a fourth-quarter $20.1 billion loss compared with earnings of $5.7 billion the year before. Included in the announced loss is a $19.3 billion impairment charge related primarily to dry gas assets in the U.S. but also western Canada and Argentina. Excluding those impairments, adjusted fourth-quarter earnings were $110 million, compared with $1.8 billion the year before, as downstream losses offset upstream earnings. Our fair value estimate and narrow moat rating are unchanged. With the impairment expected after a filing in December, perhaps more important for investors were the other announcements made during the report. Most notable is the forward capital guidance typically reserved for the annual update in March. Exxon already announced capital spending guidance of $16 billion-$19 billion for 2021 last quarter, which was lower than the $21 billion it spent in 2020 which was $10 billion lower than 2019. It also announced updated spending guidance for 2022-25 of $20 billion- $25 billion per year well below the $30 billion-$35 billion it announced last March. It expects to be at the lower end of the range in 2021, which, along with the dividend, should be covered with operating cash flow at about $45/bbl, assuming continued poor downstream and chemical margins. Beyond this year, it expects to cover the dividend and capital spending at oil prices as low as $35/bbl or with capital expenditures at the upper end of the range at around $50/bbl, both assuming historical average downstream and chemical margins. These breakeven levels also include the $3 billion of structural cost advantages it achieved this year and the additional $3 billion it plans to generate by 2023. Any excess cash flow would go toward debt reduction and shareholder returns. This guidance should calm investors who became increasingly worried about Exxon’s heady capital spending plans and safety of the dividend given the pandemic fallout and sustainability of future oil demand and prices.",0.9252

2681,"Oil at $75 a Barrel by Summer? Goldman Analyst’s Forecast Is Bullish for Energy Stocks.By Avi SalzmanFeb. 22, 2021 11:57 am ETGoldman Sachs raised its estimates for oil prices on Monday, projecting that Brent crude can rise to $75 a barrel in the third quarter on increasing demand and a slow rebound in supply. That price — which is well above the projections of most other analysts — would be enormously bullish for oil stocks.–– ADVERTISEMENT ––Oil prices have risen more than 20% this year. Last week’s storms in the South forced some production off-line and caused prices to rise, but they sunk back later in the week. On Monday, Brent crude futures were up 2.5%, to $64.45 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate futures were up 2.9%, to $60.98. Oil stocks were rising, with producer Pioneer Natural Resources (ticker: PXD) up 4.5%.Goldman analyst Damien Courvalin previously had expected Brent to rise to $65 by the third quarter, but now sees $75 as likely.At those prices, oil stocks could see big gains. Because of the high initial costs to produce oil from a well, many U.S. companies don’t break even on their investment until oil prices are over $45 or $50. But once prices hit those levels, a much higher percentage of each dollar ends up flowing to the bottom line.For some price-sensitive stocks, each $1 they get from oil prices can lift earnings by more than 10%, according to analyst Paul Sankey of Sankey Research. Among the companies that get above-average benefits from high prices are Marathon Oil (MRO) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY). Oil stocks have trailed the market for a decade, but commodities are back in favor and oil has become attractive because it’s “a lagging real asset that benefits from a stimulus driven recovery and has demonstrated an unmatched ability to hedge against inflation shocks,” Courvain wrote.Based on futures trading data, money managers and traders are more bullish on oil than they have been at almost any time in the past year, according to Citigroup analyst Ed Morse.Aside from jet fuel, demand for oil products is rising quickly as economies around the world rebound from their pandemic lows. While oil producers will ramp up production to take advantage of the price increases, supply probably won’t catch up with demand for a while, resulting in a “tight oil market this summer.”“While we believe that OPEC+, Iran and shale supplies can materially increase through the second half of 2021, all these are likely to remain highly inelastic in coming months to even higher oil prices,” Courvalin wrote. “In particular, the recovery of Iranian exports is likely to take months and would further be accommodated within our assumed aggressive ramp-up in OPEC+ output this summer.”Analysts had come into the year anticipating a slow recovery, with oil prices hovering somewhere in the $50s or perhaps reaching the $60s. But the price recovery has been faster than expected — in part because of the success of vaccines in containing Covid-19 in some parts of the world and in part because of the decision by many producers to keep production low even as prices rise. In the past, the cure for high prices has been high prices — producers simply ramp up production and the increasing supply causes prices to drop.These days, however, companies have been holding back on adding new wells, because investors have been demanding that they keep capital expenses low and focus on growing their dividends. OPEC has also been remarkably cautious in restoring production after reducing collective output by 9.7 million barrels per day last year, or about 10% of total global production. Saudi Arabia unilaterally took another 1 million barrels out of production early this year, giving the market an even larger tailwind.",0.9984

A relative of mine, in his mid 30's, who lives near the equator, just this year put AC in his house for the first time. He and his family, and his peers like it. Natural gas exports via LNG shipping from the USA, started roughly just 5 years ago, are growing and greatly desired in a world hungry for more and more electricity. Renewables are great, but the steady demand for more and more electricity is much greater.

Natural gas prices are much higher in other areas of the world than they are in the USA.

I'd be very happy for XOM to provide clear debt reduction guidance with corresponding crude/refined prices and say 'if/then' related to their debt load. Ideally, they'll regain their two downgrades (at least one) in credit worthiness. No need for them to go overboard, debt is still VERY cheap, and I'd rather they have cash on hand and be looking for opportunity than to go too far on the debt reduction/share buy-back/dividend. Just elevate the dividend a couple pennies this FY, and get the financial house in order.

Tomorrow EIA report should shed some light on why they reported a gain in supplies last week when demand exceeded production.

Only a country like Germany which has been fairly good at controlling the virus is now exposed and with a low level of infections in the population and a lack of vaccine rollouts, the infection numbers should be pretty ugly there, especially if the countermeasures prove ineffective like the UK.In any case, with oil prices down the Saudi's preaching caution at raising production at the OPEC meetings should be much stronger and hopefully Russia realizes this as well. My guess is the April OPEC meeting now will not see any sizable increase and the Saudi's will extend their 1M production cut as well. That should raise oil prices again, especially as travel in the US grows rapidly. TSA said 1.5M air travelers recently that is almost back to the 2M normal level.",0.9917

2900,"DARREN WOODS CEO speaking about XOM's dividend philosophy Sure. I think as I said in my prepared remarks and I've repeated in some of our press release, the priorities in the capital allocation scheme that we've got have not changed with what we're seeing here in the short term. And again, it kind of comes back to a large business that has depleting assets. You've got to continue to invest in industry-advantaged accretive projects if you're going to sustain a strong foundation to support the business going forward, a successful business, to support a growing and reliable dividend and to maintain a strong balance sheet. So the project's investments are critical foundation to the long-term health of the business. And then obviously, if you look at our shareholder base, about 70% of them are retail or long-term investors that look for our dividend and see that as an important source of stability in their income. And so we have a strong commitment to that. And then finally, making sure that we have a balance sheet to manage the volatility that we see in the ups and downs of the price cycles. Obviously, we're in a pretty deep -- pretty big dip here, which is outside of the normal price cycle volatility. But I think we're demonstrating that the balance sheet is handling that through this time frame. So that priority remains the same. And then I think the question, and I talked about this in the Investor Day is how do you balance across those priorities in the short term. And so today, as we -- to face these very short-term challenging market headwinds, we are making sure that we're maintaining that dividend and continuing to advance the projects with the expectation that we'll see a recovery. Our revenues will rise, more cash will come in, which will allow us to continue to invest in those projects. And so that we're not making a trade-off on the medium to long term but one in the short-term based on the needs of our investment base. And I would just tell you that we'll continue to strike that balance as we go forward. If this market evolves and we see changes in a recovery that's slower than what we have even anticipated, recognizing we've been pretty conservative in our outlook, we'll have to step back and look to see if we need to make any further adjustments there. But my view is if you don't have those investments, you're not providing the foundation to support that dividend. A lot of the projects that we've been putting in place, the capital we've been spending here over the last couple of years, those projects are going to come online and start contributing cash. So I think we're going to begin to see here in the next year or so a lot of the benefits associated with the investments we have been making, and that will contribute to the cash and provide the basis to support the dividend.",0.994

Diesel and crude are at their mid-range. So I think the US is already at a tight supply level.Refining is clearly down 1M bpd compared to historical levels so it indeed looks like they shuttered 1M bpd of US refining capacity. That does not bode well if we see strong demand over the summer.US production didn't increase, indeed it declined slightly. So I think people who are expecting US crude supplies to grow are in for a rude surprise. We seem to be barely at breakeven which means new drilling is just replacing declining production from older wells.Overall the report shows we are not out of the woods on demand yet but it does highlight that if demand rebounds strongly we are in for a long hot summer with much higher gasoline prices.",0.9504

Could then actually get a chance to buy XOM at a number in the lower 40s. Don't see XOM trading in the 30s again for a long time, if ever. So if you're someone who is waiting for that to happen, I think you will be disappointed. If you get a shot at buying XOM below $45, you should jump on it.

Who will pay for an extensive system of charging car batteries, of course the consumer will and not just the owners of EV's.I wonder if the great green brains have considered this:Snow, Traffic Jams, and Electric Cars.Can we show a little forethought and practicality? Please?Has anyone thought about it?If all cars were electric ... and were caught up in a three hour traffic jam... dead batteries! Then what?Not to mention, that there is virtually no heating in an electric vehicle.And if you get stuck on the road all night, no battery, no heating, no windshield wipers, no radio, no GPS (all these drain the battery) !!!You can try calling 911 to bring women and children to safety!But they cannot come to help you since all roads are blocked and the socialist green weenies will probably require all police cars to be electric also (if we still have police departments then) !!!And when the roads become unblocked no one can move! Their batteries are dead and they cannot move.How do you charge the thousands of cars in the traffic jam? (That is a business I think I’d like to look into. Drones to deliver heavy batteries and someone to remove and install.)Same problem during summer vacation departures with miles of traffic jams.There is virtually NO air conditioning in an electric vehicle. It would drain your battery quickly.This will make cars run out of ""fuel"" and create never ending traffic jams, not to mention high tempers.No socialist bent reporter talks about this of course!You can’t even call in horses to rescue you.

First one is that it is the 30% discounted to lowest price of last 10 years and one third of highest value before pandemia.The second one is the growth story behind the Company. Since jet fuel is the most profitable segment of refinery business, and there are 3 strong reasons for Tupras to grow its jet fuel business compared to before pandemia. One is the increasing tendency in Turkey to use flight for transportation. That means aviation industry is growing for Turkish citizens. Second is the huge airport investment in İstanbul, one of the largest around globe, which will be the flight hube. That means increasing aviation business.

I think no one needs to do anything for quite some time as the pricing pressure will remain up with the world economies rebounding. I think just holding through 2022 is a must because XOM will outperform the market and dividend increases should be happening as well. Then you have the issue of the cost cutting and new production that will lower their break even price to $35 over the next several years. With cost cutting like that it likely isn't even worth selling until you see a price that is $15-20 above Brent.If you are getting worried, you can always sell some out of the money calls for extra money and if they get executed buy them back and resell at higher prices. If you sell the $5 out of the money call for half a year or so you likely can flip it to one $10 higher if the stock appreciates by $10 in that time without losing very much on the premium.",0.9562

They have been subsidizing solar and wind alternatives for years even though they have lost billions of dollars doing so. Given that California has started to mandate this alternative even when they continue with rolling blackouts, it's time for big oil to protect their stockholders and get a reasonable return on their investments. I propose that all oil companies should enact a $1.00 per gallon recovery fee on all diesel, #2 fuel oil, gasoline, and jet fuel. At today's prices we would still be under what fuel cost five years ago. I am asking everyone on these boards to echo my request. Moving away from fossil fuels in the US is about the shifting of power in wealth. Keep in mind the US generates only 10% of the world's air pollution.

So when they said break even at $50 and then talked about being able to maintain the dividend even at $45, it likely was the $45 that best matches their 2025 $35 break even claim. So that would mean only $30B in additional cash flow compared to $50 Brent and the $50 Brent break even really is likely only $40.We will have to see how this plays out as they report earnings but it is not quite clear to me whether they have $15 in cost reductions and cheaper extraction costs by 2025 or just $10 with some hand waving to make it look like more.",0.9489

XOM is a seller of petrol, chemicals ( for paint and agriculture ) and plastic pellets that are used for dashboards, clothing, bags and various manufacturing incl. shells for phones, kitchenware and a multitude of containers. The stock of XOM is leveraged to the domestic GDP of the USA at approx 3 X although the entire business is not since it's partly financed by banks, bonds and short term deals. XOM's business does NOT need an integrated upstream to survive especially if the price of crude keeps at low and negative numbers the upstream operation can be shut down or sold since it would be cheaper to buy crude than to produce it. However. XOM's business DOES NEED the GDP of the USA to grow or to stop shrinking. In 6 months, the revenue of XOM has been cut in half ( the total sales in dollars ) and the stock price has followed but the correlation between revenue and stock price is not linear as it appears atm. in the market since a prolonged lower revenue will make it impossible to turn a profit for several years to come. I.e. the current stock price has a significant rebound of revenue already priced in but to reach this level the GDP of the USA has to rebound. To trade XOM you have to watch the GDP and employment numbers ( watch the total employment rather than unemployment ) and you should ignore the short term crude price. XOM is a litmus of Industrial manufacturing ( something that the DOW isn't anymore ) and XOM has basically zero correlation to the ""USO"" or upstream tickers.

Oil is Bitcoin on steroids because it provides REAL ECONOMIC VALUE and it will be one of the few real stores of value for the next few years while the global economy recovers from this past year’s travesty.

It is the investor's comfort level and ability to afford to hold stocks--without loosing sleep--dictates buying or selling. It is the nature of the markets--and not an expert here --that markets goals are to make money and prosper. The ups and downs of the market are standard for capitalism. With that said I believe oil will rebound and exceed expectations in the future as well as all stock. Petrol burning cars are not going away in a short time. Seemingly, customers are buying bigger and bigger SUVs and trucks. Those not buying new petrol burning automobiles will continue to drive their already owning petrol burners. Despite EV and hybrid technology in motoring these vehicles are costly up front and in my opinion slow to be the standard of personal transportation across the board. How many jet liners and ocean liners are going to electric power without petrol? Supply and demand dictates selling prices. It is reported that petrol suppliers around the world are pulling the punches now.COVID-19 is the culprit today affecting many aspects of everyday life for us all. Nonetheless oil has been a thorn in the side of the market since the 'oil shortage' in the 1970s and continues. COVID-19 will be resolved and there will be markets and demands for petrol. Unemployment is at 3.5 % so people are working! and will spend again as COVID-19 passes. If investors have a well thought out portfolio based on personal finances I recommend holding.

Exxon is best positioned in big oil and will take the lithium EV’s to the next level. I know this to be true. When the time is right, EXXON will incorporate lithium extraction and refining into their well balanced company. I wouldn’t bother investing in any other big oil companies. Exxon will stand alone and dominate the entire energy shift. I’m very bullish on EXXON and their diversity.

It is still investment grade but XOM has been adding debt as operations in refining and chemicals have been struggling the past few quarters.

They said the company would likely need to limit buybacks and “temper” capital expenses if it wants to keep its current rating. The release about the downgrade also hints at some concern about Exxon’s dividend, which now costs the company far more than Exxon makes in its operations. The agency says that Exxon’s rating could be cut again if it “continued to return cash to shareholders beyond internally generated cash flow.” Exxon's response to S&P rating change: “ExxonMobil’s financial capacity and access to financial markets on attractive terms remains strong and is a competitive advantage. We do not expect any material impact on our financing flexibility, capacity or cost.” (source:",0.9027

I'm now buying Exxon stock with the same enthusiasm the party can't go on forever. real estate values are propped up by low interest rates and lower borrowing qualifications. they've even deferred payments to keep people in their homes. if you have cash you get nothing for it in the bank maybe even service charges to keep it there. everybody wants to talk about EV and solar panels and a green economy. I myself have ordered a Tesla cybertruck and look forward to its arrival. but Ev only represent one half of 1% of the current production of automobiles in the world. never population model I've ever seen the population of the world will increase under developed countries will develop and the need of energy will increase. I see too many factors that will pull old prices higher and higher whether you want to talk about the dollar or whether you want to talk about increase future demand.,0.9876

3787,"Here’s what you need to do with your profits from $AMC and $GME. The market has taken on the false narrative that a virus caused the entire world’s infrastructure to change overnight to all solar and wind. This is simply a false narrative. There’s no doubt that the industrialized world will transition to green energy, but this will take a coordinated effort for the next 15 years.What do we do in the meantime? We change government policies to discourage oil and gas production. Part of this is to limit supply to drive up the price of gasoline and diesel fuel. This makes green alternative energy more tenable because it is cheap relative to oil and gas.In the US, the easy policies of the old administration actually hurt the oil and gas industry. They drilled and drilled until the US became the world leading exporter of oil and gas. Then COVID happened and world wide demand dropped by 8% - that’s right only 8%.So far in 2021, demand has recovered by 5%. As of right now, we are only using 3% less oil and gas than we were. Does that sound like a dead industry? Absolutely not.The meteoric stock price rise of solar companies and $TSLA is a bubble. The profits are not there.Now with oil at $53 and Nat Gas at $2.85 - oil companies are profitable.With oil and gas supply being limited by policy - we can expect oil to be $75 by 2022 and over $100 by 2023 - 2035. This is the last golden age of black gold. The last bull market of oil before the oil majors buyout the green energy companies with the treasure troves of cash they are going to generate over the next 15 years.So...take your profits and buy $OXY $XLE $XOM $CVX $ET & $GEL.

4053,"So the EIA report struck me a bit odd. We had supply builds of all of the major products, oil, gas and distillates. This shouldn't have happened because we are still well below the refining capacity, i.e. refineries are still ramping up and it isn't happening rapidly. Indeed, if you add up the consumption numbers for gas, distillates and propane, consumption was up about 400k over production. So inventories are getting tighter. Likely we just drained more end supply and a surge in product is coming from the end vendors. Maybe they just held back filling their tanks because of the refinery outages and that backed up some supply in order to keep prices low at the pump.With 13.4M bpd of refining going on we likely still have 2 weeks before we are back to normal there which would be 15.8M bpd.*** Careful, posts are being censored *** Someone doesn't like this post for example, this is my second listing.",0.9354

4165,"Discretionary capital, not discretionary dividendsNoise around XOM’s dividend has grown louder with increased levels of concernseemingly calling its stability & future growth into question. The reason: XOM did notcover capex & dividends in 4Q19 at what was arguably bottom of the cycle for 2 of its 3businesses and with net debt increasing $9bn (2% of capitalization) in the past year.Several media headlines report that XOM is ‘borrowing to pay its dividend’. These seemto have increased concern for one of the few “dividend aristocrats” within the S&P500and against an already fractious period for energy. In this note we counter the concerns,noting that XOM is borrowing against an AAA balance sheet to fund discretionaryspending that underpins unique capacity for long-term dividend growth.Counter cyclical investment pays dividendsXOM underinvested when oil was >$100. Windfall cash repurchased >$100bn of stock withaverage capex well under 100% of c/flow in contrast to all of its major peers. With thecollapse in oil XOM stepped up acquisitions, raising capex at the bottom of the cycle; again incontrast with peers reverting to scrip dividends and with subsequent declines in capexcreating capacity for buy backs now, which while seemingly a positive have merely reverseddilution. Through the downturn XOM paid dividends in cash, with average growth of 6%.We see ratable dividend growth >50% through 2025Cash dividend coverage in 4Q19 was >2x; discretionary capex left free cash negative afterdividends, but makes deliberate use of a balance sheet management considers as a strategicasset that enables counter cyclical investment. In our view, pro–cyclic asset sales ultimatelybridge planned funding gaps while hi-grading the portfolio towards a greater mix of lowercost, higher margin assets. Near term growth is anchored on the Permian, expected to becash neutral from 2021; longer term, industry leading margins in Guyana with productionrisked higher ahead of its 3/5 analyst day anchor visibility for a 2x increase in c/flow webelieve can support dividend growth of 7% through 2025. This sits in contrast with recenthistory of XOM’s closest peer, RD/Shell which has a stagnating c/flow outlook and a dividendthat has flat lined for the past five years.

It took 20 years to achieve energy independence and one year to lose it if the current trend continues. Now that the economy is on the mend, a $10 / bbl import tariff would be almost unnoticeable and will just raise gas price at the pump to just below pre-covid levels. That will help pay for the enormous deficit accumulated because of the stimulus and can also be used to give oil companies tax breaks and cheap financing until the current slump blows over.

4319,"0854 ET - Despite posting a $20B 4Q loss, Exxon Mobil assures investors that its rich dividend is safe. The oil giant, which shells out about $3.7B in dividends each quarter, says it expects cash flow this year will cover planned capital spending while allowing it to maintain its dividend and a strong balance sheet. Exxon said its assumptions include Brent prices of $50 a barrel, but it says that even if Brent falls to $45/bbl, it will cut capex to preserve the dividend. Exxon's 87c quarterly payout results in an annual yield of 7.75% based on Monday's closing price of $44.92. Exxon rises 2% premarket.",0.7275

The reason energy only became 3% of the S&P was for a very simple reason, because we were in an extended deflationary period from 2000 on. Now we are seeing inflation come back for the first time in a long time and that may well mean energy again regains its ""inflation"" hedge value that it used to have in the past. That means a much larger % of the S&P weighting might well be coming, especially as earnings crush it.4) None of this factors in why oil is going up, it isn't just the Saudi's, it is clueless Joe and the green idiots.

In the industry we know talk at great extension of crude to chemicals pathway. It is not simply taking crude putting it through atmospheric distillation tower, FCC, Alkyl and isomer unit make couple different cuts and be happy with it. Runnin a refinery is not very profitable. However if you refine crude and take a chemical pathway such as cracking liquids to make ethylene, methanol, LDPE LLDPE you have a syngerized business that does not put product into pipeline where your profit floats onspec prices. Here in southern texas we have got crackers, polymer units popping like there is no tomorrow, CP Chem cracker off Houston, SASOL new Mega Complex in Lake Charles La, new Mega Olefin plant to build in Corpus Christi wiht Exxon and SABIC which will be printing money in 3 years. What I am getting to is that base chemicals business is stronger than ever and in part is supplmented due to oil and crude feedstocks. Tesla's are run on batteries but are manufactured out of polymers from those base chemicals. Exxon is cutting jobs midstream in oil, refineries that sit bythemselves witout internal feedstock and product cricle. Shell is mothballing Norco Refinery which sells on spot prices. So yeaht tighter integration will make an break this business. Exxon with its assists is positioned to boom chemicals surge in the middle class in the develping nations is born.

After rising 60% from the 3/23/20 low through 5/5/20, which was more than twice that for the S&P 500, the sector will again soon underperform the overall market, by our analysis.

4572,"XOM is a contrarian play, but I think a smart move. An analyst on Yahoo says it is ""uninvestable"". If Biden wins, he will make every effort to appease his environmentalist base and ban fracking and give subsidies to EV. The reality is, most electricity is made from NG even with renewables expanding. Increase demand for electricity with EV's and you get higher demand for NG. There is simply no other way to bring more overnight charging capacity to the grid quickly besides installing more NG turbines (basically monster jet engines running on NG). As far as oil demand...people are not going to stop buying gasoline and diesel engine vehicles anytime soon. Even if gas goes to $5/gallon due to some price shock like a middle east war or fracking being banned or politicians jacking up gas taxes, people love their big vehicles. With the pandemic, RV sales are booming. Environmentalists love EV's, but RV's get 8-12 MPG, that's 100 gallons of gas or roughly 5 barrels of oil in a single 1000 mile road trip. Boat motors also are fuel hogs. Trucks and SUVs are more popular than ever. Even hybrid SUVs, crossover, minivans get at best 30-35 mpg. Other uses for oil: plastic. EV's are almost 100% carbon fiber epoxy body panels and interior to save weight. Doing away with straws and plastic water bottles doesn't change the demand much. Tires for vehicles are not going to be made from anything but SBR (oil).Jet fuel is a major user of oil. Eventually we will have a vaccine or learn to live with COVID like the flu and people will fly and take cruises again. I think we are tired enough of this scare-mongering that we will move on and go back to a more normal life.Adding regulation to US oil production drives the little oil companies out of the market. Big oil that is well financed will prosper. So as much as green voters for Biden hate big oil, they also love their modern conveniences and need the oil. Banning fracking moves oil production in the USA back to off-shore and deep water wells. Only the big companies can afford that. So, my opinion is, be like Buffett and buy when the stock is out of favor. Be a value minded contrarian and buy low, sell high. On the dividend, who cares? If XOM cut the dividend to 5%, would you stop investing in it? What does the bank or a T-bill pay for interest? You going to sell XOM and buy T or DOW for bigger yield? Neither one has the potential to double from here like XOM does.",0.9986
4573,"Kawazunohito you are 100% correct. Look at what XOM already does with GlobalThermostat, FuelCell (FCEL), and their own work with carbon capture with tetra-amine technology. They already are looking to the future, and also realize natural gas and liquified natural gas is here to stay a lot longer than most people think. Before long power plants will be able to burn natural gas and LNG with at least 90% of all carbon captured . No renewable is free from pollution--just look at the carbon footprint, THE TOTAL CARBON FOOTPRINT, required to make and instill solar and wind farms. While no one can argue the benefit of not burning fossil fuels to create electricity, natural gas is here to stay as a very, very large component of the overall mix of electrical energy production in the world, and will be done so a cleanly as any other source once these advanced carbon-capture and fuel cell technologies become reality. Most likely it will always remain the #1 source of energy production. And directly to Kawazunohito's point, XOM will over time be a major investor/buyer/producer into renewables. What they cant achieve organically they can and will buy and invest into as the future energy mix continues to evolve. Why investors currently dont see that is beyond suprising.

The most fuel efficient EVs get less than 3 miles per kWh though you will see some hyper milers claim higher numbers, the reality is 3 miles per kWh is generous. Now less than a third of the energy we use to generate electricity ends up at your wall socket, you can see this from data provided by the DOE they produce a nice graph every year of our energy use with inputs on the left side and outputs on the right. So given these facts the equivalent MPG for diesel would be roughly 12 mpg for an EV but diesel produces more GHG than gasoline so for gasoline the proper value is 11 mpg.Now some econuts might argue that you need to add the greenhouse gases of product and refining of gasoline which are roughly equivalent to what a gallon of gasoline produces, this would mean to compare an EV to a car you need to half the mpg of the car. Modern hybrids exceed 40 mpg, so that would be 11 mg vs. 20 mpg.Oh but wait, diesel produces way less GHG than coal and since EVs put new load onto the grid you won't be able to retire coal as rapidly so you need to score all EVs against the dirtiest source of electricity used in your region, that is almost always coal.",0.9351
