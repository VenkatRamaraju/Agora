The manipulation here, through a bear plunge is just surreal. But one things for sure, its the same old tired burrito in a world full of choice and while one can dream of a return to the glory days and growing into this valuation, it has as uch chance of happening in the competitive restaurant space as pigs have a flying.

One might want to consider looking at it that way, since the total libilities is up $143M in one year. After this huge run up the market cap is $19.467B.19,467M /33M => ""PE"" = 590It might make more sense to look at the earnings that way and the PE that way as well. If there ""effective PE"" is 590 and they are growing at 6%, then the price might appear to be 100 times too high. Adjusting for liabilites, it look like they only have $33M to call earnings for 2018. Remember the article where Ackman says CMG has a 6% growh rate. Am I way out of line here? Am I thinking right? If I were an investor, I would want to include the total liabilities in the big picture. Someone said they don't buy buildings, they rent them. It's posted here on this message board, quite recently. I don;t feel like looking it up. I'm going to guess that it is $464M per year, their rental bill.

88,Just remember 98.83% of the float is held by institutions. They've got big incentives to keep the price high to both maximize commissions and keep customers happy (on paper at least). Unwise to pretend there is real value at these prices.,0.9351
89,"I think CMG will go down a lot more under 400, this time around, that hedge fund manager can not save CMG, because the earnings number does not support the price at this level.

545,"food for thought,did analysts read the 8k?-Bill... I'm still trying to sort through some of the numbers from the earnings report.The adjusted earnings were $87.2 million which comes out to $3.08 EPS.The problem I'm having is that $100 million in expenses (deferred social security payments and accelerated depreciation) were allowed to be deferred due to the CARES act.This means that actual EPS was negative $0.80. Since delaying a payment doesn't negate the expense CMG should have reported the loss.I believe this is also why the effective tax rate was negative 3.4% vs. 22% in the year ago quarter.I believe CMG should be forced to change it's reported numbers. Also I believe that Brians statement of ""no debt"" should be retracted since leases are no longer allowed to not be disclosed as debt.Actually, it was a brutal quarter with worse to come. Hard to say what restaurant traffic will look like nect year, Spanish flu raged for three years.@dellis915CARES hasn't kicked in yet, based on my reading of the 8-KAlso, the lower tax rate is due to stock options exercise.I agree with your point about the operating leases.I think margins will weaken further, due to a combination of higher protein costs (Covid is in meatpacking houses), a change in delivery (getting your meal at the cash register is cheapest), a softening of demand from consumers who fear losing their job and are scrimping, are unemployed, or are working from home.Thanks guys. I was getting my info from the CMG press release. Now I see the $100 million is expected (future).I also see why earnings would have been much lower if they had to pay 22% taxes.Another question....

For CMG Q2, it's safe to assume that April- May 15th chipotle was under lockdown allowed only takeouts, which I assume about 20-30% of revenue (keep in mind that most chains have drive thru but CMG does not). May 15th- June, CMG may get lockdown lifted at various locations; I assume that revenue for this period is about 50% of normal since most people aren't back to work fully and there is still fear of crowd and eating foods made by strangers. Thus, Q2 will suffer a huge loss.Q3 and Q4 will likely follow the same trend as Q2 since lifting off partial lockdown at various places would only allow the virus to spread again. Thus we will likely suffer a surge of cases at the beginning of Fall to a degree where we will have to endure a very strict lockdown to free up hospital spaces for patients. Keep in mind that in Q1 chipotle was able to defer numerous charges, like tax deferment and those have to be counted eventually in 2020. Thus trading at a PE ratio 70, at share price of $870 in a sector that is struggling to keep afloat is grossly overvalue. My price target is $200 by next year, if they still have cash left. But if they run out of cash, we may be looking at $20/sh (assuming no vaccine or cure).",0.981

You also know Ellis did everything ""Taco Bell"" is doing, save for the massive deception he's engaged in right now.Loyalty programs. Ellis did it. Mass employee engagement? Check. Digital? Check, although he didn't stupidly put home office shelving in every store where people can easily steal bags of food, Nor did he put second make lines in stores so food sits out untouched waiting for customers who will never arrive. But hey, that's part of the deception, so maybe not so stupid.You don't think Ellis looked seriously into how to run Chipotle's with one less worker a shift as this jerk is trying to do? Of course he did. Why didn't he do it? Because its won't work...but hey, its a key to the deception. Go look at any employee internet blog. All the comments are? ""I used to like my job but it's impossible now."" ""I'd like to see those corporate guys in the video try to do one shift like this."" Those ""future"" cost savings are part of the deception. Somewhere down the road, ""Taco Bell"" will wipe it all away with a ""We tried it and it didn't work."" The stock will crater but he, the CEO, Ackman and everyone else will have cashed out in the $600's and maybe $700's and there will be no repercussions.To put this into perspective, you are paying $7.5 million per store that do $2 million in sales and grow at 8%. You can buy Shake Shak for $18 milliojn a store. Each does $4million and they are growing at 30%. Or you can buy Chuy's a popular Mexican sit down restaurant that does $4 million a store, growing at 8%, no debt and pay under $3 million a store. It's outrageous.The valuation is a joke.

It has zoomed up too far, too fast and is in dire need for a profit taking correction, that should retrace 1/2 of its recent gains..that would result in a dip back to the $700 to $750 vicinity. Analysts have gotten way too giddy in their optimism and bullish sentiment is running at extremes-expecting earnings of $8.81 in 2021 along with more than 100% earnings growth in 2022 to $18.38...that equates into a frothy forward earnings multiple of 48 times, more than three times McDonald's (MCD) forward multiple. In addition, the highest analyst's one year price target of $1010 presents possible appreciation of a mere 15%...that seems like very little reward, for way too much risk. What happens when the short covering fuel begins to wane, or the company experiences food safety issues again? One other point, The CEO dumped 55,975 shares last Friday. That's nearly $50 million worth. In addition, the company's Chief marketing Officer, Chris Brandt sold 10,000 shares, followed by Chief People Officer, Marissa Andrada (sold 1961 shares) and Laurie Schalow, Chief Corp Reputation Officer ( sold 1597).WHY are they selling?

723,"Everyone knows that preserving the economy is important but if it puts people risk, then you have to sacrifice a full shutdown for 4-6 weeks as Bill Gates and Bill Ackman suggested. It hurts more but only for that short period of time, and from that we know we have done our best to suppress the spread. On the flip side, the partial lockdown, where people are still going to work and congregating in groups and sharing enclosed spaces, puts the entire population at risk? So the spread continues to propagate.In regards to Chipotle, the CDC already have evidence that even talking and breathing has the potential spread of aerosolized droplets. How do we ensure that the droplets don't get to our food, containers, and wrappers. The delivery guys who handle the packages, another extra pair of hands to contact the containers and wrappers. Even restaurant owners suggested early that we should close down ALL the restaurants completely to stave the transmission. The CDC and our government at the same time tell us to wash our hands, don't touch our face, rub our eyes, or touch our mouths. Yet they allow food made and handled by many unknown hands, and respiratory droplets. Restaurant workers are not health professionals; they don't know sterile techniques. How many times have we witnessed a restaurant worker wearing the same pair of gloves that she uses to wipe the table counter and that same pair of gloves are worn to make and serve our foods? I simply don't understand. Sorta like they knew that smoking caused cancer but they allowed tobacco companies to advertise and sell cigarettes to even kids. I am a big proponent for stopping this Corona on its track, and the ONLY way is to have the strictest lockdown where only groceries, pharmacies, and hospitals are opened. Even if you go to the groceries, only one person per family can go at a time to limit crowd and exposures. Even food delivery, business is typically 20% of the usual revenue, so why bother and put the entire population at risk? Worse case scenario for restaurants is that partial operations where delivery is allowed for many months and the control of the spread is no where near desire level, what happens next is a complete shutdown. But by the time of complete shutdown, the companies will have suffered many months of losses in addition to the dread of 4-6 weeks of closure.

CMG used to make $5.4 billion in revenue; I assume the cut back is reduce to $1.5 billion at best due to lack of people working nearby the restaurants and most are just being cautious not to put things in our mouth.Thus in 2020, chipotle burns $5 billion in cash to keep opening, yet revenue is only $1.5 due to 60% reduction.Negative $3.5 billion for the year? This estimation is too far, let's assume management cut back costs of goods to just $2.5 billion which is half the usual and admin cost is still the same $450 million. That means cost is still around $3 billion but revenue due to 60% reduction in revenue ($1.5 bil). That leaves a negative $1.5 billion.

1163,"Posted byu/hippiemoose311 hours agoWife of a former GMAs the title says, my husband worked for Chipotle and quickly became a GM (he should?ve been hired in as a GM but that?s a whole other story). He worked for the company about 7 months and was probably his second favorite job he had ever had before #$%$ really hit the fan. Like all of you other employees he was facing the ridiculous influx in sales and the even more ridiculous decrease in staffing. He was working 70+ hour weeks and was never here to see our newborn son. However he left and has been a completely different person; he?s happy, he?s able to see his son, he?s gaining the weight back he lost from the insane amount of stress and time taken by Chipotle. My point here is, get out if you are being taken advantage of by this company. No job is worth the stress or missing your children grow up etc. You are human beings; even though some customers and the company may not treat you like it. Quite frankly a fair amount of you could file for unemployment and if Chipotle tries to fight you on it you take them to court for unfair working conditions.

I think expanding that margin without raising prices is real challange.Reason:- They required more staff than before to support quality check. They also likely throwing out more food items. With raising salaries, margin expansion not possible unless they push store sale to 2.5M level.Without expanding margin, Only adding new stores is not solution. I know many friends who no longer eat there.

If you kept their business flat (no growth) over a 10-year period, they will have a $72M tax benefit annually. On a share count of 28.8M, this is an extra $2.50/yr in EPS. So, over a 10-year period, the tax changes will add $25 to EPS. So, EPS over that 10-year period would be $109.70, instead of $84.70. Once you factor in their expected growth, that number becomes even larger. Regardless of how restaurants have been traditionally valued, a 29% benefit to profits over a multi-year period makes this stock and others extremely undervalued.

They also have access to a $600 million dollar line of credit should they need it. Now, the interesting things here: 1) Digital sales up 216%, which means that their digital strategy is working. 2) Comparable Restaurant sales are finally starting to turn positive (June had a +2.0% comp)In spite of covid, their revenue was only down 4.8%. That's incredible when you consider that their stores were shuttered and they have had to do all of their deliveries through their online platform. They are a burrito chain which still made over $1.4 billion dollars despite having their doors closed (think about that for a minute). In the future, I would expect Chipotle to pull a Dominos and start to look at smaller footprint stores so they can pay less rent and just have the stores function as delivery only locations. With the trajectory that they're on, they have options to modify their consumer channels while still potentially increasing revenues. I know people want to proclaim doom and gloom, but that's really not the story here. I'll be curious to see what Q3 brings (e.g. can they increase their digital sales and revenues in spite of covid?)

I steered clear from her, and I haven’t had any symptoms since then. Which I’m glad.So, today is the 9th of May. We got the news that she did in fact test positive for COVID.

After which they add the other items which cost considerable more. So what you have in that big bowl is a lot of rice. Think you’re getting a big bowl of food? How much is rice? SMARTIf customers say NO to rice, the food cost of the business would double and essentially amount to .15 a share loss in net income. People still like the good, however, less people and visit less often. Let me ask you this question: when the CEO took over in February of last year, the stock was $240. Move up to this February and you have $600. Now, what do you suppose this new CEO actually accomplished to make the stock go from $240 to $600? What did he do?

In March is more representative of the entire year which climbed 102% of regular delivery/online sales that came out to be 37% of normal total revenue. IN March they ramped up online/telephone orders and ads, which were not included in Q1 costs. So I assume they will add those costs into a very dismal revenue in Q2. BTW in March, Chipotle was king of the online/delivery because most restaurants didn't adopt this until late March which now are taking market shares from Chipotle. But if you just base it off their Q1 result where online/delivery only accounted for 26.3% of their revenue, Q2 entire revenue will be based off 26.2% of the entire revenue coming from online/delivery.Thus, result for Q2 will be zero walk-in revenue, 26.3% of the entire revenue comes from online/delivery, minus those one time charges of ads, online/phone orders, delivery contracts.

However, anyone who has even a basic knowledge of investing knows that CMG is currently extremely overvalued, and the stock will eventually fall to much lower levels. That said, it is foolish to short a stock on valuation alone. Valuation is a great long-term investing tool, but it is worthless over the short-term. As long as the overall market keeps rising, CMG is likely to trade higher.

We started the shut down in early March, and it took about 2.5-3 months to reach peak and it will take another 2-3 months to taper down to where the companies can slowly open again. Even if it opens, it will be a slow start, not gang buster full operation. Thus, we are looking at 5-6 months of lockdown which is basically until next fall or Thanksgiving. The question is, are you gonna have crowds of shopping during Thanksgiving risking another surge? Difficult dilemma. I think our best bet is vaccine or treatment which is about a year away. Will most companies survive 5-6 months of lock down? Will CMG survive?The reality is coming next week where companies start posting earnings Q1 and guidance for Q2. Energy sector is already filing BK one by one. It's a domino effect, and prospect of much longer shutdown. The reality is hard to swallow but the Trump administration has been pumping Wallstreet and giving false hope. Trump's intention is obvious to everyone; he can careless about lives at stake or the economy for that mater. His only concern is 4 more years of power to stroke his ego. He said he is the president and he must act like a cheerleader. Giving false hope and misguiding the public into thinking that the virus was a hoax costs the US trillions and lost of lives. Currently the administration is continuing to misguide us, giving us false hope of an early opening of the economy, the problem with that is a flurry of corona cases, more lives will be lost and back to square one again. Even the chinese, as aggressive as they are in dictatorships, where they welded doors shut and dragged people by their feet to quarantines, the opening of their economy is slow and still spots of outbreaks and lockdown at various cities still exist. The question is will the selloff starts before Q1 posting and disclosure of Q2 data or people will wait to see the numbers then selloffs? 18% off from a bubble that most economists were expecting a correction, even without the virus, seems like a hick up.

Since I don't expect the overall market for drop another 1% or so over the next few trading days and I feel that CMG wouldn't drop substantially even if the overall market tanked like it did earlier today, I've covered my shorts at $419 for a total average gain of $8 per share. If and when CMG gets to $400, I'm likely to buy or if it gets back to $433 first, then I'm likely to short it again. Even though CMG is still making lower highs and lower lows in a classic downturn move, I just don't like the way CMG stayed steady while the entire market failed today. I believe I can find a better opportunity else ware to CMG when the times right. Good Luck with your investments!",-0.1691

They have to be visible. Here is the deal, I saw maximum of 16 people during 20 mins that I watched at any location. Which looks quite low to me. I called each location and asked questions like - till what time were they open and how was the foot traffic. Most locations were open till 10pm (they open at 10:45am) and the traffic volume was less than half of normal times. Perhaps they have less staff but rest of the cost is still there and even in the second week of reopening the volume is so low. Remember this includes 500% increase in digital that analysts are singing. So prev-covid stock high was $933.

By end of Q2, SHAK EBITDA will be less than 1/2 of prior quarters so we are looking at SHAK price trending towards 80X EBITDA.

When CMG hit $433 on April 27th, my original thesis was that CMG would either test $400 like it had every time in its post-$400 rise in the past, in which it would be a candidate to BUY or it would fade a little only to re-test $433, in which it would be a good candidate to short. Now that it has broke above its most recent high of $433, I believe CMG will find it tough to break above $445, which it has failed to break though 3 out of the last 4 times over the past 24 months. There just simply is not enough good news on the horizon to keep CMG at 2 year highs. Therefore, SHORT 1/2 position at $441 and SHORT another 1/2 position at $444, with a STOP at $451 or COVER at $400 (or whatever lower level you feel comfortable with, because sometimes it's better to take a small profit than no profit when market conditions change).

The stock's all-time high was $966, achieved in early 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic reached America's shores.Analyst Nicole Miller Regan at Piper Sandler raised her price target in a $250 hike from her previous estimate of $850. Her research note cited Chipotle's $900 million in cash as one expected source of strength, before enlarging on how its management ""is operating from a more proactive position and showing flexibility around changing consumer behavior.""￼IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Her analysis went on to describe how Chipotle has switched over to a 70% digital sales model, and stated ""Fundamentally the company has the ability to pivot and the financial resources required to carry out its long-term growth strategy.""Before the novel coronavirus arrived, the fast-food chain was posting comparable sales gains higher than 12% year over year. Even after the coronavirus arrived in the USA, Chipotle managed to adapt quickly to new models of doing business and saw sales starting to recover somewhat as early as the second half of April. The fact that the company is debt-free also helps it with its survival and recovery efforts.Lending more weight to analyst optimism, Chipotle closed just 4% of its restaurants, keeping most locations open for takeout. The company may also use its cash for both new restaurant openings and remodeling projects designed to increase its average unit volume, or AUV, including the opening of many more digitally integrated drive-through ""Chipotlanes.""",0.9957

After that date, the stock traded within a $10 range for the next three trading days until it finally started dipping lower. By the eighth trading day, CMG was down 12% from the high. The volume on 7 out of 8 trading days after the 7M volume day never exceeded 1.5M shares. Seems to me that we are repeating the same type of scenario here. If CMG dives 12% from the high of $433, then it could reach $381 before bouncing back. I don't know if we will get there, but a $400 test is most certainly in the cards. By the way, on the 3rd trading day after the big spike, CMG closed only $7.50 from the high. If we close today around $426, then we will be on track to repeat history.

If you are extremely generous and optimistic and give them a PEG=2 on 15% CAGR and that gets you to a stock price of (2x15=30)x15 = $450 in a few years. Discounting at a very low rate of 12% gets you to a price of about $320 today. If you take a more reasonable PEG=1.5 and a discount rate of 15%, you get about $340 in a few years and $220 today.So I think we get into the low $300s and find some support and bouncing there and then range into the mid-upper $200s for a while before the stock begins a more sustained increase.

You walk in and go straight to the head of the line type dead. Today is a completely different story. Business seems steady as ever. You might ask why I wasted an hour of my day today driving by 4 different chipotle locations....my wife asked the same. My answer - research. I've bought on the recent dip. I do not believe the Virginia incident plays out anywhere near like 2015 did. Even if mgt guides conservatively during ER, chipotle is a good long term play. I think it's a good short term play as well as the sell off is excessive given the concern.

So no buyout possible at least for couple year. (Main fear when you short not one of largest.)2.> Growth rate is not there at all. 10% revenue increase only bring 100 basis point margin improvement. At 50+ PE that's not enough.3.> Some Pricing power sure they have but cost raise is at same speed remove any significant benefit from price raise.4.> New store expansion is great but it's capital intensive business and return not immediate. So they can suddenly start opening 100's store overnight.5.> Brand improvement will take time. getting all customer back unlikely as well. 6.> Online ordering great but more than 50% never get on board (Starbucks is example where they have great online ordering but yet majority still buy at front desk) Now both brand can't increase staff or retail space to separate online and in store line processing and so In Store wait time increasing with online order.

You only gain value if you can convince suckers to buy in your $1000-5000 garbage. CMG has become toxic in its own manipulation scheme where the shares are 90% owned by institutions. Thus, you only allow them to make profits off you when you buy their shares or get suckered into calls/puts.

2671,"With so much opportunity to buy quality stocks at a reasonable price, I can't spend any more time or energy thinking about my short on CMG. So here's my last thoughts on this trade: CMG is trading like it did back in February 2011, when it shot up 28% going into (and including the rise after) earnings, only to give back 12% within the next 8 trading days. By the 3rd trading day after earnings, CMG was off $7.50 from the high. Now, 3 trading days after earnings, CMG is off $7 from the high. Like then, we have made lower highs each day for the past 3 days (though, we are not making lower lows, today's low was within 20 cents so I'll count it as close enough). If history repeats itself, CMG will continue to drift lower for the next 3 to 4 trading days without ever reaching the high of $433. So, I'm short an average of $427 to cover at $405 or to be stopped out at $434, for a risk/reward payoff of 1 to 3. I expect to be either stopped out within the next couple of days or to cover by next week, whichever happens first. Good Luck with your investments!",0.9541

2803,"They erase my posts on projected losses during the 2 months lock down: But here it goes again.Revenue from 2019 was $5.4 billion, divide that by 12 months, you get expect $450 million/mon of revenue. But many restaurant owners stated that their expected income during shutdown doing deliveries/order in is like 20% of normal. 20% of $450 is $90 million. Two months revenue is $180 million. Costs of raw material in 2019 was $4.443 billion/12 months= $370 million each month. For 2 months, cost is $740 million. Administrative costs was $443 for 2019, each month cost is $37 million, so for 2 months= $74 million. One time cost for ads, delivery, ordering system is estimated around $200 million. Add up all the costs for the 2 months= $740 mil + $74 mil and +$200 million, that is about $1 billion.So for 2 months of lockdown, the company spend $1 billion to make $180 million, that is a whopping $820 million loss based on my estimation, assuming they did not scale back on materials. They have not laid off any employees, and I did not take into account the price increase in raw materials during lockdown. Again, this is just a crude estimation for the 2 months lockdown. But based on this estimates, if the lock down is 2-3 months longer, the company will be in serious financial problem. Sold all my calls today, going with naked short and long term puts.",0.9659

ETChipotle: No, the Corner Hasn’t Been TurnedBy Ben LevisohnWhen Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) reported its same-store sales earlier this week, some observers argued that the beaten-down burrito purveyor had, at long last, turned the corner. Not so, say Raymond James analysts Brian Vaccaro and Alex Marty. They explain why:We reiterate our Underperform rating on CMG and are lowering our EPS estimates to reflect lower-than-expected 4Q comps that were pre-released earlier this week at the ICR conference. CMG shares were up earlier in the week, which we attribute to short covering in light of a return to positive comps in December. However, two-year trends remained sharply negative in December (and also deteriorated sequentially on a geometric basis), which supports our core thesis that there has been a 15%+ sales loss due to a permanent change in consumer behavior/frequency. We continue to see a sharply negative risk/reward skew as consensus estimates seem overly aggressive and believe the stock’s historical valuation (35x+) will be difficult to recover (growth algorithm from normalized EPS base likely in upper teens). Our bull/bear analysis suggests a negative risk/reward from current levels (downside $225-300; upside $412, in-line with current stock price).",-0.8708

3290,"After reading some analysts comments about Chipotle, I am convinced this company is going to be sold very soon. In the last quarter's earnings call, there was no mention about new CEO or new menu items. Even the CFO said they are spending almost $20k per store for renovation when the average costs about $250k, which is very little. Only a company that knows they are getting bought out will spend little, not add new items and not care about getting another CEO. Furthermore, the activist Ackman sits on the board of QSR, Restaurant Brands International, owners of Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes. A Mexican food chain will complement their existing business brands with food variety and they will achieve efficiency of scale by combining food suppliers and reducing overhead management. In addition, QSR headquarters is in Toronto, Canada and by acquiring Chipotle, they can benefit from their lower tax rate. Although anyone can potentially buy them, one thing they can't do is start from scratch and scale up as Chipotle has prime locations similar to Starbucks. Look at Shake Shack, Sweet green, Dos Toros, all great concepts, but their growth is limited to how good the locations are. Most analysts have downgraded the stock and just Friday Cowen lowered their EPS to set the bar even lower. Even if you factor in the tax benefit, it equates to $2.50 EPS annually which will help them easily beat any estimates, but this is if continue to be a public company....You can go ahead and bash or short this stock, but the possibility of waking up one morning to find out the company is being acquired will crush any bearish position you have.

3433,"08-14-2020 @DAVE ... ""That is unbelievably amazing... The EXACT same thing has happened in the past as well. Why doesn't the S.E.C. investigate something like that?"" ...Many possible reasons:1. SEC is in a slumber, but should someone with ""heft"" or stature bring this to SEC or FinCEN, they might listen.2. SEC is a well-known ""revolving door"" of people who used to or would like to in the near future work in a private sector, for a lot more money and bennies, having SEC / gov't service experience and relationships on their resumes. Many at the top and middle layers of SEC currently don't know where they will be in 6 months, so investigating WS financial shenanigans may not be exactly their priorities at this time.3. Many in the investment industry (some may now be at SEC and later be back ""on the Street"") have probably dined in one or more Danny Meyer's fine-dining Union Square Hospitality Group (USHG) 20+ NYC restaurants, and would like to do so again when some or all of them reopen; also Meyer is sitting on several boards of companies with potential IPO and some that will certainly need WS help with raising money through loans and/or other financial services that WS lives on (just like recent recap via dilution of $SHAK) and he is also involved in some feel-good non-profits and restaurant / farming community organizations. Maybe that's why they have been so brazen about it, they may feel at best ignored and at worst untouchable.That's why Meyer's USHG and Shake Shack share the similar marketing theme (easy to search): ""Union Square Hospitality Group's BELOVED restaurants, cafes, and bars..."" / ""Union Square Hospitality Group has created some of New York's most BELOVED restaurants, cafes, bars..."" / ""USHG is the hospitality company founded by Danny Meyer, and owner of some of New York City's most BELOVED restaurants."" / ""We love to reimagine BELOVED, classic dishes..."" / ""The (fill in the city) Shack serves up all the BELOVED Shake Shack classics..."" etc. etc. - it's in their 10Ks, 10Qs annual reports and all marketing literature. ""Iconic"" and ""cult"" are other monikers they use - that's how you sell inferior products at higher prices to tourists and brand-curious, and that's why they need high-traffic places like malls and terminals, stadiums to attract casual traffic and sustain high AUV - but their retainment rate is low, 75% of first-time visitors never come back, so expenses are high, gross and the net margins are low and the business model at these high valuations is not sustainable over long term.5. Now, an article about ridiculous valuations and of these WS + SHAK insiders stock shenanigans in highly regarded financial publication(s) or a statement by a well-known short-seller would go a long way to get attention of SEC / FinCEN, but in this environment of The Fed and Fed gov't flooding the market with trillions of dollars to bail out ""the market"" and ""leave no zombie company behind"" it's not a sure thing that it will turn into something concrete. After 2007-2008 GFC market crash and unraveling of Madoff's decades-long Ponzi scheme operation a lot of mini-Madoffs were uncovered and busted... I guess we are still some ways from Zombie Companies Apocalypse, staved off by Trillions of dollars, some flowing to companies that should be saved while most going to WS Mafia Laundromats ""washing"" money through entities like $SHAK and some other zombies, with insiders sharing in the booty.I and a few others on this board (and some articles in Forbes, SeekingAlpha, etc.) have been documenting for more than a year this financial engineering fraud and the ""love story"" between WS Mafia and SHAK insiders and there are enough forensic accounting evidence to bring this to logical conclusion - the question is, would anyone blow the whistle loud enough for SEC or FinCEN to wake up and do their jobs? Shake Shack CFO (""Chief Financial Engineering Officer"") Tara Comonte was promoted to President in the beginning of this year - ever wondered why? CFO + President is unusual and rare; CEO + Pres, Pres + COO, CEO + COO are much more common. Randy Garutti is completely incompetent as CEO flailing in different directions, trying one failed scheme after another (GrubHub exclusivity, trying to emulate Chipotlane with pretty ""Jetsons""-like sketches, ""digital ecosystem"" etc.), he is just a marketing cheerleader spouting usual slogans ""brand,"" ""opportunity for growth"" and ""I don't care about margins, I just want to sell more burgers - that brings in cash"" on ERs, ""investor conferences"" and CNBC.Well, we'll find out next week if only 1,666 left open from last $55 LIMIT order have been filled... or maybe they used the opportunity today to also ""park"" another 25K shares for Danny Meyer, on no-news low-vol day with $SHAK ""somehow"" being up nearly 3% during the day while $CMG, $MCD, $WEN, $QSR, $SBUX etc. were all down or just barely in the green at the same time?",0.9996

A Market rate. That number for Chipotle is $9 billion, topsIn 2018 Chipotle instituted a 5% price increase. This is the last quarter that earnings will comp against pre-rate hike revenue and profit margins. After that, growth will slow down significantly, quarter to quarter.

Perhaps CMG gets bought within an index fund when the market moves up, or its in some funds, so it gets bought on upticks.

In the past every 0.1b increase of revenue will have 0.5$ earning increase. So with rev 1.26b CMG can get earning 1.72+0.5=2.22$. Can not get to 2.9$ earning3. CMG has promotion programs, assume it reaches 1.3b revenue, it can not reach 2.9$ still4. Visited 5 CMG stores in Silicon Valley area, around Sunday 1-4 pm, there are about 10-30 people inside, much less than neighbor Starbucks. There is no waiting line. So traffic is not high at all at this Sunday afternoon high hour. Around 2013-2014, chipotle constantly had 5-10 people waiting in line around this hour since I went there around this hour after soccer kid gameSo the earning for this quarter will not be as good as 2013-2014. Let us look at how much 2014 earning is5. Around 2014 July, with 1b revenue, it gets 3.5$ earning. In the past 1 year earning is much lower, consistent with low traffic in store. 6. Insider takes 2.5%, not small at all. They can not sell before earning due to prohibition, but they will sell after earning. 7. Last quarter earning beat 0.4$. Stock runs high. In the past years, after a quarter of huge beat, it at most meets the expectations. So April earning at most meets the expectation. In the past when earning just meets expectation, stock goes downFor people who short, don’t worry. This is a good time to add more. Then just wait till April 24th. MM knows all this.

This is one of the strangest, ""pump up a pig"" case I have ever seen. Besides the CEO running around talking nonsense to anyone who will listen, besides all of these third rate ""analysts"" from fourth rate ""investment firms"" coming out in coordinated upgrades, weekly, the press also seems to be involved to a big degree. Take this latest martketwatch article.""One big reason, of course, has been the improving fundamentals. Revenue is expected to have grown 8% in fiscal 2018 when the company posts year-end results in the first week of February, and earnings are projected to jump an impressive 29%.Looking forward, CEO Brian Niccol, who joined from Taco Bell in March, has done an excellent job taking this stock into the 21st century with a digital sales plan that looks a lot like what companies like Panera Bread and Starbucks SBUX, -1.25% have done to unlock significant sales via mobile devices instead of in-store orders. That is a big trend to watch in 2019.""Why no mention of the 5% price increase? Take that away, because you sure can't do that again for a couple of years and it grew at 3%. Considering they opened 150 new stores to a 2200 store base, a roughly 6% increase, they are actually losing customers on a per store basis in 2018. For a mature restaurant stock trading at mega growth PE levels, that's a huge problem.And to bring up Panera? who had over 2,000 stores and $5 billion in revenue when it sold for $7billion? As an example of the track chipolte is on? CHipotle has over 2000 stores and only $4.5 billion revenue. If someone bought the company at the current stock price they would pay $15 billion, double what Panera sold for. What a horrible comparison.The 29% profit jump is an impressive number but you're still paying an astronomical price for profit. The company made 188 million, net. there are more than 2,000 chipotle's. That means roughly, each store makes under $100,000. You're paying about $7,000,000 per store when you buy stock. In what world would a return of $90,000 on a $7 million investment be a good investment? They could increase profit 29% for five straight years and it still would be a horrible investment. Get out of you're long, folks. Sometimes PE's don't matter, particularly in internet and tech stocks where growth can be torrent. This is a restaurant. It will take years for them to slowly grow this for this valuation to make sense. We're seeing a short squeeze but ultimately valuation is what matters and this one makes no sense at all.",0.999

It deserves to go to 200, but it may go to 800 instead.Short it all out and they may take it up to take you out or to try to take you out. And you loe big time. It got here some how. Part of the story might be that it once was up around $800, but I believe they may have been growing faster. They got the CEO from Taco Bell, I believe, and he has made some changes like a drive through, etc., and got the store sales up. Maybe store sales are up, because they closed 24(?) or however many they closed, so the per store sales looks better. New CEO, but you already have the store, seems they could turn it to being profitable. Also, retail sales fell. Also, the tax rebate checks seem to be miniscue for many this year, or they even have to pay in and were expecting rebates. CMG is retail. I think they have 3.5% more stores overall includng the closings. That might represent their growth. Having said that, the PE was 91 last I looked. Not sure how much the buybacks influence the PE exactly, but the buybacks seem to be about the same in dollar amounts as the earnings. So, perhaps the PE without the buybacks would be somewhere around 180. Now we are talking about a company with a 3.5% growth (I saw 8%, but not sure where that came from) and a PE of 180 (accounting for the buybacks). The last quarter income was lower than the quarter before it. I believe the actual income was $32M for the very last quarter. And I calculated that the market cap increased $4.5 billion since earnings. So it went up in market cap 140 times the last quarter's earnings. No ones in jail yet.Manipulated to the moon, it seems to me. But, that's reality. It won't go down, just because you discover it is 5 times too high. It could be 18 times too high. One calculation I did said their earnings was around 2.5%. That again isn't considering buybacks, which means earnings might be more like 1.25% without the buybacks. That's pretty sick. But its trading at $604 today like it or not. It won't go down because you want it to. It could go up. I posted a form to fill out to send your concerns to the Attorney Generals Office. So far I got the acknowledgement that they received my form. If some other shorts (I""m not short at this second, I was off quite a bit, saw it turn green, got out with a small profit. traded some other stocks for a nice profit, got out, and am waiting, thinking should I waist my time with CMG?) also contacted the Attorney Generals Office, they might ask to see share counts or try to determine of some index fund or other fund or retirement accounts are getting ripped off by buying a stock with a growth of ?? 3.5 to 8% and an effective PE of ??180??When you look at this statement, verify I'm correct""The last quarter income was lower than the quarter before it. I believe the actual income was $32M for the very last quarter. And I calculated that the market cap increased $4.5 billion since earnings. So it went up in market cap 140 times the last quarter's earnings. No ones in jail yet.""It makes you want to short with full margin. Do your own homework.

Just measly $372 million when the expenses is $1.3 billion?Let's extrapolate further, assuming that March had a bump in digital sales of $172 million, but Jan and Feb had $100 million each because they were not yet impacted by covid. March represents the month under covid, $172 million in sales in a month. Therefore, best case scenario if lockdown continues until June, is revenue of Q2 of $172 mil x 3 months= $521 million. worse case scenario with competitions with other restaurants also doing digital/takeouts, is $372 million from Q2 number.

The E Coli outbreak was always going to be overcome with time as it was with Perrier Water when it was found to contain dangerous levels of arsenic (long, long, time ago and now, as I say, forgotten by almost all and not known by the present generation). Additionally, as a result, CMG now has the best health controls in the industry. Almost certainly safer than your own kitchen.It’s now all about the potential; a current stock price is reflective of the likely future, risks included, of course, not the past: proven new CEO, additions to menus, breakfast menu addition, improved delivery options, more US stores, yet to make an international foray, no borrowings.

And they can periodically drop the stock or raise it dramatically to pick up options on puts/calls or get the stock price where they need it to be too unload. For example, imagine they sell some deep in the money naked calls, then suddenly drop the price so they can keep most or all of the option value. Sooner or later the game ends. Cramer putting CMG on his buy list suggests to me there is something shady going on, as few in their right minds would think CMG is a buy here.",0.9851

Not true, Chipotle said they were hiring ""up to"" 10,000 people, Chipotle also said they were adding drive through lanes to 60% of it's NEW stores. That's a big difference. Also there is a cost #$%$ociated with constructing new stores with drive-throughs. What is the time it takes to recoup those costs? They my favorite part of the article - Katherine Fogertey, a Goldman Sachs restaurant analyst, argues that Chipotle's digital strength has boosted sales so much that the Street's sales estimates are wildly wrong...Her analysis implies that Chipotle's same-store sales could be up 5% to 10% in the second quarter based on app download trends.Now there is meanful analysis. How does that offset the fact that California and Texas are the states where Chipotle has the most stores, which had and have again restrictions on indoor dining.But...I have every faith that Chipotle will beat earnings estimates best on some shyster accounting #$%$ cause you know, you don't need dining at your establishment when you have an app., constructing new restaurants with drive-throughs happen instantly and are free, and it takes no time to amortize the cost of construction and turn a profit on new location.

4381,"This just out from WSJChipotle Mexican Grill Inc. said same-store sales fell short of expectations in the first quarter despite a surge in online orders, illustrating the challenge to restaurants seeking to reach customers during the coronavirus pandemic.Restaurants across the country have closed their dining rooms since cases of the virus spread across the U.S. in March. Chipotle said Tuesday that its same-store sales fell 16% that month. Chipotle’s online orders, which it has heavily promoted in recent years, jumped 80% for the quarter to 26% of sales.But costs for labor, delivery and supplies such as masks and hand sanitizer weighed on Chipotle’s results overall. The chain is funding free-delivery promotions and has boosted wages to keep employees coming to work. Chipotle said its first-quarter profit fell 13% to $76.4 million.Chipotle also said it would pay $25 million to resolve criminal charges stemming from a string of foodborne-illness outbreaks connected to its restaurants that sickened more than 1,000 people. The chain and the Justice Department said Chipotle agreed to pay the fine and enter a deferred prosecution agreement, allowing it to avoid conviction if the company maintains an improved food safety program. The department said the fine is the largest ever in a food safety case.Chipotle was implicated in at least five foodborne illness outbreaks between 2015 and 2018, connected to restaurants in Los Angeles, Boston, Virginia and Ohio, the Justice Department said. The charges were related in part to outbreaks of norovirus, a pathogen that can cause severe illness and can be transmitted by food workers.Chipotle said it is providing masks, gloves and hand sanitizer for employees of its 2,640 stores to protect them and assure customers that its food is safe to eat. All stores should receive the materials by the end of the week, the company said. Executives said they would open full-service on a restaurant-by-restaurant basis as states start to allow residents to eat out again.The company withdrew its guidance for same-store sales and new store openings given uncertainty surrounding the impact of the coronavirus crisis. Chipotle said it would pay its fine to the government this year, which it said would hurt liquidity. Chipotle said it had enough cash to sustain it for more than a year. The chain said it was working to secure a credit line of $250 to $500 million with its lenders.Chipotle said sales in locations open at least 13 months were up 3% during the quarter, slightly below analysts expectations. Sales were $1.41 billion, up almost 8%, but slightly under analysts’ expectations of $1.42 billion. The company said adjusted earnings were $3.08, beating FactSet’s consensus from analysts of $2.88 a share.",0.9431

I only stayed because I really wanted to get the tuition reimbursement but I got screwed over by my manager for never putting me on the schedule when I went back to my original store for break. I thought chipotle was a great company at first but how they have handled covid has shown their true colors. My old location is in a very red county and customers would regularly come in without masks on and we couldn’t say anything. One shift over the summer my MOD texted our FL because we were drowning in onlines (we don’t have a DML) and he just sent a “$”. That was a key turning point for me. I’m regularly stressed out at work and it’s so mentally exhausting. My location is in a college town and I was working 15-20 hours a week last semester and now I work 5 a week because it mentally screws me up. I dread going to work and clocking in. I’ll be going over my schedule for the next week and days before the one day I work is already eating at me. I love my coworkers but a lot of them have left and moved on with their lives. Also we are religiously understaffed and we’re a $11k store. Every time is rush because college students will eat anytime anywhere.

Associated PressSAN FRANCISCO — Northern California’s wine country was on fire again Monday as strong winds fanned flames in the already scorched region, destroying homes and prompting overnight evacuation orders involving nearly 70,000 people. Meanwhile, three people died in a separate fire further north in the state.Residents of the Oakmont Gardens senior living facility in Santa Rosa boarded brightly lit city buses, some wearing bathrobes and using walkers. They wore masks to protect against the coronavirus as orange flames marked the dark sky.The fire threat forced Adventist Health St. Helena hospital to suspend care and transfer all patients elsewhere.The fires that began Sunday in the famed Napa-Sonoma wine country about 45 miles north of San Francisco came as the region nears the third anniversary of deadly wildfires that erupted in 2017, including one that killed 22 people. Just a month ago, many of those same residents were evacuated from the path of a lightning-sparked fire that became the fourth-largest in state history.“Our firefighters have not had much of a break, and these residents have not had much of a break,” said Daniel Berlant, assistant deputy director with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire.Sonoma County Supervisor Susan Gorin evacuated her home in the Oakmont community of Santa Rosa about 1 a.m. She is rebuilding a home damaged in the 2017 fires. Gorin told the San Francisco Chronicle that she is numb, and the situation feels surreal.“It’s like God has no sympathy, no empathy for Sonoma County,” she said.More than 68,000 people in Sonoma and Napa counties have been evacuated in the latest inferno, one of 27 major fire clusters burning across the state, said Berlant. Many more residents have been warned that they might have to flee, even though winds eased significantly Monday afternoon, giving firefighters an opportunity to make some progress, he said.“The smoky skies that we’re under are a sign that there’s not a lot of air movement out there moving the smoke around,” Nichols said at an evening briefing. “Not good for air quality, and folks outside exercising, but great for us to work on containing this fire and working on putting it out.”What the News Means for Your MoneyGet the tools you need to succeed in the market, with real-time market data, news, and analysis from MarketWatch — one of Wall Street’s most reputable brands for personal finance, business, and market news.

Officials did not have an estimate of homes destroyed or burned, but the blaze engulfed the Chateau Boswell Winery in St. Helena and at least one five-star resort.Logan Hertel of Santa Rosa used a garden hose to fight flames at a neighbor’s house in the Skyhawk neighborhood until firefighters could relieve him.“Seems like they got enough on their hands already. So I wanted to step in and put out the fire,” Hertel said.Dominic Wiggens, who lives in the same neighborhood, evacuated but returned later Monday. His home was still standing, but many others were gone. “It’s so sad,” he said.Pacific Gas & Electric PCG, -5.50% was inspecting its equipment as it sought to restore power to more than 100,000 customers who had it turned off in advance of gusty winds or within active fire zones. The utility’s equipment has caused previous disasters, including the 2018 Camp Fire that killed 85 people and devastated the town of Paradise in the Sierra Nevada foothills.More than 1,200 people were also evacuated in Shasta County for the Zogg Fire, spread over 23 square miles by Monday.Shasta County Sheriff Eric Magrini announced Monday afternoon that three people have died as a result of that fire, though he gave no details.“It’s with a sad heart that I come before you today,” he said, urging residents to heed advice to leave. “When you get that order, evacuate immediately.

4550,"Posted byu/ellisdclub4114 hours agoFood Poisoning due to Cauliflower RiceConcerned CustomerHave a pretty certain suspicion that both my wife and I got food poisoning last Sunday night from the cauliflower rice in our chipotle bowls. My parents also ate Chipotle with us, but they got brown rice in their bowls. My wife and I both got cauliflower rice in ours. We are around 6:30pm. She woke up at midnight with stomach cramps, then nausea/vomiting/diarrhea... I felt fine and assumed she had come down with a stomach bug... however at about 3am the same thing happened to me. It was pretty awful. We both laid in the bed with fever all day yesterday. After retracing all of our steps and interactions the only thing that makes sense is either the cauliflower rice OR the salsa that we got on our bowls. Those are the only things that we both consumed, and the only difference between what my parents consumed (they didn’t get any salsas on their bowls).",0.9739

Forget growth, which was touted as some justification for its 50 x earnings multiple. Remove growth, remove new store openings etc - all the catchment of last yrs claims to high valuation. I have no idea if the shares will retain the current 50x multiple factor based on 2019 expectations for 2022-2024.

Moe's Southwest is mostly regional and follows a franchise model, which cannot be rolled out fast. So, unless we assume that the company has already saturated the NATIONAL market, the company still has huge potential opening more than 100 restaurants a year in a way that only they can. And, like all other food-borne illnesses, in time, all will be forgotten. Do people really think that this is the only chain that ever had these problems?

4875,"Look, it seems like:1) Stores: CMG is opening fewer stores per quarter. This could be temporary, but also may represent an ongoing issue with the difficulty in finding and opening new locations. Time will tell, but it is important for overall growth and it is an indication of slippage.2) PE: CMG is a growth stock and the PE (and lets all admit this is a VERY healthy PE for the sector) is based upon what the earnings will be in the future. It is really priced for perfection and we have witnessed the first imperfection in the latest report with store openings. Will there be a new imperfection? More labor issues? Shortages of critical products (the steak will run out this quarter?)3) Expenses: They caught a break this quarter, but I think we can all agree that major components in their expenses could be going up. The most populous state in the U.S. just enacted a law that basically kills the gig economy there – and the CEO of DoorDash came out today about this shortsighted law. CMG already admits that the cost for delivery is high. Now add in other components increasing in price and CMG earnings growth may decrease thus putting pressure on an already healthy PE.4) Competition: Believe it or not, some of CMG’s competitors are smart. They will observe and learn. And they will then target CMG’s customers.5) Fickle Public: You all may be dining fans and go to CMG every time you dine out, but I don’t. And while today CMG may be the new hotness, tomorrow it may not. All it takes is one food/illness scare and the public flees for a period of time as we have seen.6) General Market: The market it is bit top-ish and if there is a correction it will have an impact. But I do not see major market moves upward from here to the end of the year. 7) Analysts: The latest analyst reports are small increments upward – more of a tuning rather than any major move prediction. Let us all understand that those reports have certain bias in them.8) Year End: Well, time to take profits? Rejigger the portfolio? All will impact the market and thus CMG.Look, I hope there is more upside for the rest of the year, but I am a skeptic.",0.9976

4951,"PE of 540 for a fast food place, and now they are spending additional $$$ on kids programming, and investors think this is a good thing? Wow, there must be some very stupid fund managers out there. Simple math, market cap is 13.18 billion, for 2250 stores, equals nearly $6 million per store, ....and...they don't actually own hardly any stores, they instead pay leases on those spots. Each store has approximately $50,000 worth of equipment, if they had to be liquidated. If a store did have to be shuttered, they would break the 20 year lease, which would come at a much bigger cost then the $50,000 worth of equipment. There is no way a store could ever sell for $6 million, even if it does $3 million a year in sales, because it only brings a profit of $300,000/year. Investors should think about this before they blindly start buying up shares. If you had $6 million would you feel like it was a good investment to buy a fast food place that made you a return of $300,000/year, especially knowing that if there are any problems at all, or if something else comes along that is better, or for any reason at all your sales go down even a little bit, you would be erasing that $300,000? I don't think so. I think Bill Ackman is pulling whatever strings to run the price up so he can exercise his call options and sell those shares. I wonder if he bought those options from someone as naked calls, then as he exercises them that person has to buy shares in the open market at market. Who really knows what is going on, but I can assure everyone that SOMETHING is going on to explain this two day price hike. As soon as the market closed, the shares briefly dropped $3/share on one transaction, and then recovered. Big time manipulations are happening right now and I think after it is done we will see these shares make a huge 30% correction downward.

I get it. But I could never support it because of the high PE ratio.Look at CMG now in a very different market environment, where it is now risky. We are not talking about growth anymore but rather survivability; there is no growth in any restaurant business period until a cure or vaccine is found! Even the lockdown is lifted and everyone can go back to their favorite restaurants and eat, would anyone crowd and able to enjoy a carefree meal? NO! There will be a lot of trepidation over the virus because now there are supportive evidence of different strains, so even if you got infected you could get reinfections and we already know that a good majority of infected are asymptomatic who can spread to others. There is now evidence that suggests covid 19 is also spread via oral transmission, thus, a presumed healthy chef, server, or cashier can easily transmit the virus to chipotle dishes of fresh veggies, meats and corns that are left in the open before they get wrapped up into either a burrito or a dish of choice. If anything, I think chipotle carries a lot more risk than most other restaurants because of the fresh dishes. That is under the best case scenario that the lockdown is lifted in 2-3 months, but the business continues to suffer 1-2 years from now, until a vaccine or cure is discovered. The worse case scenario is that we have difficult time containing the virus, now scientists and government are beginning to look at other possible ways to enforce stricter guidance. Shutting down ALL restaurants is a possibility, if they think that eliminating the takeouts and deliveries are worth the economic expense to control the virus pandemic to a manageable level.

5115,"Corona Virus will cause havoc to the food industry. It has already impacted oil, cruises, and airlines. The next sector is food, simply because of risks associated with crowds and contacts. Chipotle will be heavily impacted, simply because the business has little or no control on exposure to Corona. MCD and Burgerkings, Taco Bell all have enclosed spaces where they make foods for customers. Chipotle is out in the open, separated only by a limited glass cover. Hence, customers will bring risks to the business, talking, coughing, and sneezing will aerosolize droplets onto the freshly made chipotle dishes (all dishes are uncooked which is a huge risk). ALL dishes at Chipotle are made only few feet away from customers; thus, they have little or no control over customers who are bring risks to the business. You can't say the same with MCD, Burger King , carls, or Taco Bell because all their dishes and burgers are made in the back, away from customers where risks are reduced by cooking and being far from customers. Worse case scenario, if Corona is out of control, the CDC may force closure to reduce risk to the public. In my opinion, this is as bad as being on a cruise line. Trading with a PE ratio of 55 is astoundingly over priced; it will fall to below PE of 20 (market average and even lower due to Corona). This is a short target.
