Many European companies like Airbus, Lanxess, Faurecia, FCA, Ferrari, etc, already started to adopt AI to innovate their business, and Palantir Foundry is the AI package partnering with most of them. Why ARK is investing in Palantir and 3D printing? It is not just because disruptive technology, but also because they are the core of industry 4.0. Just imagine what happened after Industry 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. New change by industry 4.0 has been started, and AIs are in the core of Industry 4.0.I saw one analyst from Seeking Alpha criticizing Palantir's poor customer base from zero to 78 clients since 2003 downplaying Palantir's future growth potential. I understand his point, but it is the same criticism saying that Tesla has been producing EV for 10 years, but now they ONLY produce annual 600,000 vehicles per year which is less than 2% of entire world car production, so no value for investment.

562,"Such extreme wrongness as the recent posts is rare. SFDC pay to employees is among the highest of any company. I do not like that, but it is a fact. SFDC makes huge profits but GAAP creates huge paper ""expenses"" from the acquisitions and the use of stock to pay employees. If you make two billion in cash, and use that two billion to buy a valuable company, does that mean you made no profit? It does in GAAP. (simplifying of course.) If your stock goes up in price, does that mean you made less profit? It does in GAAP, if you paid with stock. Ask your CPA if you don't believe it. The IT infrastructure is already built and they paid for it, no problem. They are paying for expansion, no problem, to accommodate the billions of dollars of new business that they get. Note that these expenses - bandwidth, compute cycles, energy for cooling - all have declining prices, while the cost of designing and implementing their scalable infrastructure is done. It is the competition who now face all those expenses, without the premium pricing that SFDC receives as the best product. It is the competiiton who are forced to buy SFDC, which has no need to sell out.To change platforms now would be ruinous. MSFT never was a ""friend"", anyone who thought so does not understand modern business. Alliances are made when mutually advantageous and broken when it is to either one's advantage. Siebel was a legacy on-premise loser, an example of what not to do and what not to buy. SFDC has the leading products in SaaS, and is the only big company that is still increasing revenue rapidly.

2309,"My opinion and observation. People are freaking out. I am not. I am still holding at 38.00 and 31.00 and I have ZERO worries. A) Being a dropbox user that has used other cloud sharing programs including Google Drive, it is my preferred. B) Dropbox is a beast on it’s own but its attachment and the two new integrations into Salesforce CRM is only going to turn it into a Monster Beast. Salesforce has ownership, acquisitions and investments of many private companies. (Business Insider has another listed I did not see on the website. ($DOMO)If you are NOT familiar with Salesforce ($CRM) then do your DD on this company. Unicorn performance. Marc Beinoff made a 100 million dollar investment into Dropbox prior to going public. Which according to business insider this is one if it’s largest strategic investments ever. Prior to the 100 million, Salesforce invested 5 million. Salesforce owns more shares in Dropbox than any other company. It is also the 2nd largest investment by value. The highest value is in Docusearch but with less shares than Dropbox. Dropbox two newest integrations with Salesforce is only going to continue growth, in my opinion. Salesforce invested publicly traded companies. $DOCU Docusign which IPO last April with a 52 week range of $37.00-66.00 currently at 57.74, $TWLO Twilio with a 52 week range of 52 Week Range 23.25 - 79.47 current 76.04. $DBX Dropbox 52 Week Range 26.61 - 43.50 current 29.04. Look at Salesforce financials, revenue and growth. The 52 Week Range $CRM 90.09 - 149.35“Salesforce expects to post $20 billion to $22 billion in revenue in its 2022 fiscal year. If it hit even the low end of that range, its revenue would be more than double the $8.4 billion it posted in fiscal 2017, which ended in January.To get there, Salesforce expects to offer a wider range of products to a broader set of customers worldwide. The company expects its total addressable market — which is the combined amount of money spent globally with Salesforce and all of its competitors on the products it offers — to grow from $72 billion in 2018 to $120 billion in 2022.” (Source: Business Insider)",0.9961

Here is the trend for 2021 inflation:Month ____ Month% ___ Annualized%Nov _______ +0.22% ______ +2.8%Dec _______ +0.28% ______ +3.3%Jan _______ +0.33% ______ +4.0%Feb _______ +0.4% _______ +4.8%Mar _______ +0.48% ______ +5.8%Apr _______ +0.58% ______ +6.9%May _______ +0.69% ______ +8.3%Jun _______ +0.83% ______ +10.0%Even the above has been underestimating the increase of inflation, expecting the CPI inflation to show +0.48% in March 2021. The actual number came in at +0.6% for March. That is already an annualized rate of 7.2%. This is rising a lot faster than expectations and will be VERY DIFFICULT to stop if it goes unchecked. This is like a train that got on the wrong track and is rapidly ascending toward disaster. The engineer is asleep in his chair. Inflation is far BEYOND the Fed's target of 3% per year. It is already more than 2X of that target. There will be no more stimulus. Huge rate increases are coming. And a stock market crash is going to come as the Fed will urgently need to become the market's worst enemy. Nasdaq will head to 5000. It has inflated way too high.

Let me explain, according to Benioff at Dreamwork Conference he explained the ""Holy Trinity"" as gathering customer information in one place so clients can easily view their customers purchases/trends, desires/interests, stores visited and other data for better targeting. Now doesn't that sound exactly like what Benioff blasted FB for doing, capturing and selling data. Again, it is what a cloud based system should do to help their clients better understand customers, but it is dishonest to disparage FB and others with a holier than thou attitude. Just thought I would share the hypocrisy of this guy that leads CRM.

3182,"I would like to offer predictions today.Big tech’s dominance is finally over. Their decline began in 2020 and in a few short years they’re going to be in a free fall as the public confidence in them rapidly erodes. A major realignment will take place and MICROSOFT is going to emerge as the dominant leader because of a spectacular growth in its revenue and profitability. Coupled with the fact that CEO Nadella is a level headed person focused on Microsoft’s growth and not activism, investors will see the value in its stock. I believe even more investment will flow into the $MSFT stock starting this year.My prediction for other stocks:1 Investors will start realizing that $AMZN’s valuation is significantly higher than its peers. I believe the stock won’t surpass the ATH it saw in 2020. It is quite likely that the stock price may decline during 2021.2 $AAPL stock will likely grow higher during 2021, but its high flying days are over. Apple car is just a concept and it will be several years before a physical product is launched. In the meantime, Tesla Cybertruck and a possible low priced car may already be in the roads, thereby making Tesla the undisputed leader. It will be very difficult to penetrate its market. I see no innovation from Apple and investors will see that too.3 Stocks like $GOOG, $FB, $TWTR will likely stagnate and commence MASSIVE declines. I expect that regulations by governments around the world will act as catalysts to their decline.4 Other tech stocks like $WDAY, $NOW, $CRM will likely have more realistic P/E.",0.9655

There appears to have been a falling out between the two when Benioff backed outof a deal with Nadella and demanded a price higher than the about 50% premium he was offered. At that point the war was onas Benioff left Azure for AWS and Nadella doubled down on Dynamics CRM. Since then Nadella bought Linkedin, beating out Benioffand Benioff has made acquisitions to further compete with Msft. Let's see, MSFT has 9 x's the market cap and over 100 Billionmore in cash than CRM. CRM does not make much money and depends on its stock price to compensate employees and make deals.Linked wanted cash and would not accept CRM stock. If investors begin to sense that CRM is overvalued, it will lose its main bargaining chip. Benioff is going to have to put up one helll of a good fight to compete with MSFT.

3402,"This is probably the best stock to day/swing trade. I have already made a few thousand dollars in the past few weeks day trading it. Here's why:It trades between $219-$225 outside of a few days where it dropped to $216 and went up to $230. So, it's essentially in this range until next earnings come out. If I buy at $221 for example and it drops to $219, I hold and wait until it goes back up to $222-223. Easy quick $300-400 play. Contrary to what ""UNCLE"" (or any other short seller here) says, CRM is not going to drop to $180 or even $200 unless there is a market meltdown again. I don't think this will happen, even if Democrats take the Senate. Maybe there will be a 5-7% selloff but that's it. There needs to be a REAL catalyst to move the market. And, with the Fed in control, I don't see a meltdown happening. Also, too much money is waiting on the sidelines to buy the dip. People are buying every dip. Is this healthy long term? No, certainly not. But, remember: for every bubble there was, it took a minimum of 3 years for it to pop (2008 and 2001 as most recent examples). We've only been in bubble territory now for, at most, 2 years. I'm going to continue riding this train.But that isn't even the main point. CRM is a large cap tech stock with a real product and real revenue. They are also best in class in their industry. And, they grow consistently YoY. A stock like this doesn't just drop by 10-20% unless there is *REAL* negative news that the market doesn't like. The Slack acquisition already happened. Beinoff said there will be no more acquisitions in the near future. The stock already fell more than 20% from Slack. What's going to be the catalyst for another 10-20% drop? Stocks are assigned value by the market. Unless there is news, stocks don't just drop 10-20% on nothing unless EVERYONE sells. Most people are not selling. In fact, people keep on buying. Look at ARK. As of january 5th, they own $50M worth of CRM stock. On January 4th, they owned $47M worth of stock, so they increased their position in CRM by $3M in one day. That's just one fund.The point is unless there is *REAL* negative news, CRM isn't likely to drop to $180-200. Shorts are playing with fire on a large cap tech stock with YoY growth and on a stock that has already dropped roughly 23%.",0.9957

3418,"People may not realize that Salesforce, a startup, consistently took market share from giants like SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft throughout its history, and it still does. Why is that? Because it was and is better. The Salesforce product line has always had a single software architecture (""force.com""), a single database, a single UI, a single set of APIs. A single way of reporting. A single set of logs. etc etc. That reduces costs and training. In addition, that architecture is far better in customization, and in reliability, and in integration with other systems. Oracle does not re-architect the systems that it buys when it does an acquisition, it just adds another little data silo to its product line. Salesforce fully integrates what it acquires. More and more, what it acquires are systems that already run on force.com, and features (Wave, Einstein) that apply to the entire product line. Consider the recent announcement of Einstein for Service Cloud. Didn't take long! That's good architecture. Still, I agree that MSFT, IBM, Oracle, and others are potential threats. But they are quite far away from what Salesforce has already built. Throwing money at a problem may or may not make something better. Going forward, the others may balk at doing all the investment that Salesforce already has done. The others lack the premium pricing and market share (revenues) that Salesforce enjoys, so the spending is more painful. The others also may realize that the Amazon partnership furthers disadvantages them in direct competition. They may choose to allocate their capital in other areas, ones in which they have some sort of advantage. My guess is they will keep talking big, and probably manage to move their legacy customers to their cloud products, but they won't pony up big bucks to battle seriously against Sales Cloud or Service Cloud.",0.9877

I'd trust Benioff on this as CRM has been using Slack for quite a while. I identified CRM as the likely acquirer of WORK when I bought it six weeks ago.

Study its chart. The 200 dma is around $202/shr, which is about $20/share from here. It is over SIXTY DOLLARS off its high. They DESTROYED their last earnings numbers. If you're thinking about whether CRM is worth it, knowing the ONLY reason the price is down is because they're buying a pricey but disruptive company that greatly enhances their product,... maybe it's time you buy some, then keep some powder dry in case it DOES go to the 200 dma. After that earnings report, and knowing that the Slack deal is baking in as we speak, I don't think it's going much lower than this unless there is a macro event out of its control.

Remember there is the MuleSoft IPO crony stuff here. Now the Chief Lawyer has SEFraudulently Misstating Financial StatementHow unethical management fraudulently misstates financial statement? The majority of cases of fraudulent financial reporting involve making a company’s financial health appear better than it really is. There are a number of methods by which this can be accomplished: (1) Overstating revenues; (2) Understating expenses; (3) Understating liabilities; (4) Overstating assets; (5) Improper disclosures. Often, a combination of methods is used. For example, a company may “hold the books open” and record revenue this year when the revenue should be recorded in the following year (overstating revenues). At the same time, the company may delay the recognition of some expenses and record them in the following year when the proper recognition of the expenses should have occurred this year (understating expenses). This post describes and illustrates how unethical management fraudulently misstates financial statement. It does not mean to encourage you to do so, but to avoid these practices at all. Advertisement Method#1. Overstating RevenuesBecause net income equals revenue minus expenses, any time revenues are overstated, net income also will be overstated. Revenue can be overstated by doing the following: Recording fictitious revenue Recognizing revenue prematurely Understating sales returns Fictitious revenue can be created by recording sales to customers who do not exist (ghost customers) or by recording inflated sales to actual customers. If the latter method is chosen, management will need to take care not to over-bill the actual customers, and so although fake documentation will be required, careful records must be kept. The lengths to which some managers go to perpetrate this kind of fraud can be amazing.",-0.595

3849,"Bernstein now sees a pathway to $125 and upgrades to Market Perform from Under Perform.The case against Salesforce's stock was based on the premise the company won't be able to organically generate a revenue growth rate north of 20 percent, Moerdler said in the note. But this is no longer the case, as the company's fourth-quarter earnings report was ""very strong"" from a bookings perspective as deferred revenue grew 25 percent and total backlog rose 40 percent. The company is seeing an increase in sales momentum due to its strong platform offering and a healthy spending environment.Salesforce's acquisition of MuleSoft will also contribute both inorganic and organic sales growth in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020, which would help the company achieve the analyst's 20 percent revenue growth requirement through at least 2020.Moerdler said Salesforce's ability to generate an operating margin north of 30 percent in the long-term or 300 to 400 basis points of margin improvement per year remains a concern. Nevertheless, the company's ability to generate a revenue growth rate of more than 20 percent makes it ""unlikely investors will exit the stock en-mass or increase their focus on margin expansion.""",0.9964
3850,"NOTIFY is a PART of this anticipated increase 2 billion in revenue. I have said time and time again Oracle goal is to beat Salesforce $CRM -- They have also added other new partners as well. This tech is going to put them a level above Salesforce. Rome wasn't built in a day. For its fiscal-2018 second quarter, ended Nov. 30, Oracle reported SaaS revenue of $1.123 billion, up 47% and yielding an annualized SaaS run rate of $4.5 billion. That $1.123 in Q2 SaaS revenue equates to 12% of the company's total revenue, and combined with PaaS and IaaS revenue totaling $396 million gave Oracle total Q2 cloud revenue of $1.519 billion.Those SaaS revenues make Oracle the world's second-largest provider of SaaS apps behind Salesforce.com, but Oracle believes it has a number of advantages over Salesforce that will ultimately allow Oracle to become the top player. Among those reasons cited by Oracle is this aggressive move into next-gen apps powered by AI and machine learning, but there are others as well:The company expects that for the four quarters spanning from Dec. 1, 2017, through Nov. 30, 2018, it will sell around $2 billion in new enterprise SaaS cloud subscriptions, a total it believes neither Salesforce nor any other competitor can match;Oracle believes that the sheer breadth and depth of its product lineup will give its SaaS business a scale that Salesforce can't achieve; andFounder and CTO Larry Ellison says Oracle is the runaway leader in the SaaS ERP market, which he says is by far the largest SaaS category—and so if Salesforce has no play in ERP, then Oracle will eventually outpace Salesforce in SaaS revenue.https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobevans1/2018/01/30/oracle-places-huge-bets-on-a-i-and-machine-learning-to-overtake-salesforce-com-in-saas/#2ab152681da1",0.9353

On top of that, they were starting to build quite a portfolio of analytics and AI with Tableau, Mulesoft, and Salesforce Einstein. Now, instead of investing $27.7 billion into their AI/analytics segments, they bought Slack to take on MSFT. If Benioff had announced they had pledged to invest $27.7 billion into their Salesforce Einstein and analytics departments over time, this stock would have shot to the moon after hours. Why? That was the direction we all wanted this company to go....not teamwork software. Quite disappointed.

4050,"Where is Salesforce? Is it still worth 10x sales? First, remember that these sales are subscriptions, which have had high renewal rates. OTOH, new containerized-app technologies may reduce stickiness. Second, revenue growth has been explosive, over twenty percent y/y for many years. If that were likely to continue for five years, I would call CRM ""still cheap"". But can it? New products (""Clouds"") continue to proliferate at Salesforce. Historically, these have achieved good market share eventually. OTOH, nowadays each product enters a market already full of cloud SaaS products. Historically, large competitors have been slow and unsuccessful when they challenge Salesforce in the SaaS space. OTOH, they have had many years to form and hone their cloud strategies, and Microsoft (and maybe others) are achieving good SaaS revenue growth. And, small single-product competitors have honed their strategies, and many are gobbling market share too. So: I think 150-ish is fully valued for the moment. The odds of a miss on earnings or projections are higher than ever. And, the odds of large competitors making significant new moves (like price cuts or bundling lots of services) are higher than ever. ( Because the tax law made them onshore huge stacks of cash.) Either event would cause a sharp drop and a buying opportunity in CRM. I am still overweight long CRM but lightening up lately, and looking for a good re-entry.",0.9934

My big concern is that Salesforce, like many companies, relies heavily on having an ever-growing list of businesses that use it, and even among each business they depend on it being used by tons of workers, the more the merrier. One effect of Covid is that businesses are and will be laying off lots of employees, some permanently, and lots of small businesses will be KO too. The landscape will basically become fewer companies with fewer employees for quite a while. So basically there is an effect of declining sales, even as other companies will likely migrate to Salesforce for the first time ever to help with remote work. Headwinds, tailwinds. I don't know where it all falls out in the balance, maybe higher, maybe lower. Benioff said it was a very ""challenging"" quarter, yet the analysts think he is giving conservative guidance which could set up for future beats. What do you guys think.",0.9841

Before that, shorts had been covering for a long time. Time to cover got down to around 3 days, so shorts had lots of ""dry powder"". Also, plenty of longtime long institutions have huge profits in this, they may be willing to protect gains by selling. 55 was the previous panic low. With the company 20% bigger since then, 65 seems like a likely bottom. Momos and their momo computers think this is the perfect short.
