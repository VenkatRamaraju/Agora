121,"Google Staff Launch Union, Escalating Tension With Leaders(Bloomberg) -- Employees of Google and parent company Alphabet Inc. announced the creation of a union on Monday, escalating years of confrontation between workers and management of the internet giant.The Alphabet Workers Union will collect dues, pay organizing staff and have an elected board of directors. It will be open to all employees and contractors in North America, regardless of their role or classification, and plans to take on issues including compensation and ethical concerns such as the kinds of work Google engages in. More than 200 workers have signed up to join so far, the group said.“A lot of us employees are feeling disempowered, like we don’t have a say in the direction the company is taking anymore,” said Google software engineer Kimberly Wilber, an activist with the new group. “A union is of our way of building power so executives can’t ignore us.”Google has clashed with some employees in recent years over contracts with the military, a plan for a censored search engine in China, the different treatment of contract workers and a rich exit package for an executive ousted for alleged sexual harassment.“We’ve always worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace,” Kara Silverstein, director of people operations at Google, said in a statement. “Of course our employees have protected labor rights that we support. But as we’ve always done, we’ll continue engaging directly with all our employees.”The new union drew support Monday from U.S. lawmakers including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts who wrote, “I’m in this fight with you all the way.”The effort, a rare campaign within a major U.S. technology company, is supported by the Communications Workers of America, which has been pursuing tech-focused organizing through an initiative known as CODE-CWA. Googlers who join the Alphabet Workers Union will also be members of CWA Local 1400. Members will pay 1% of their total compensation in union dues, which will help fund organizing staff.CWA said the new organization isn’t currently focused on securing formal recognition by Alphabet or collective bargaining with the company, a process that has been aggressively resisted by U.S. corporations.“We might need to see some substantial changes in labor law before that’s a realistic goal,” CWA communications director Beth Allen said. If the union can eventually sign up a majority of Alphabet’s workforce, that would be a “powerful statement,” but the group could effect change even without it, she added. CWA’s membership includes some workers, such as public university employees in Tennessee, who engage in collective action while lacking legal collective bargaining rights.U.S. law grants unionization rights to employees but not to independent contractors, and also makes it more difficult for sub-contracted workers employed by staffing agencies to gain the ability to negotiate directly with a company like Alphabet. Such “temps, vendors and contractors,” known as TVCs, outnumbered Alphabet’s direct employees in 2018 for the first time, Bloomberg reported.Union leaders said on Monday it was crucial that these TVC workers be part of the union as well. “We’re not going to make our growth and collective action dependent on labor law,” said Google software engineer Chewy Shaw, who was recently elected vice chair of the new union.Workers involved in the new union said they saw it as an extension of such efforts, one that could provide a more permanent structure to keep pressure on management, hold the company accountable for promised changes and respond to retaliation against activists. The organization plans to deploy a mix of protests and legislative, regulatory and legal tactics, and to weigh in on issues like antitrust scrutiny of Google. CWA in 2018 joined a coalition urging the Federal Trade Commission to break up Facebook.CWA has been working with Google activists since late 2019, and filed a complaint then with the National Labor Relations Board alleging workers were fired for taking collective action. In December, the agency’s general counsel took up some of those allegations, accusing Google of illegally firing, interrogating and surveilling activist employees. Google has denied wrongdoing, saying it supports workers’ rights and that the employees in question were punished for “serious violation of our policies and an unacceptable breach of a trusted responsibility.”",0.9018

Google and the other fraudster’s shareholders will know these gruesome facts soon enough. They must now face the music. Criminal actions like this willfully acted on have large penalties attached to them. Why? To act as a deterrent for future transgressors of course.

Perhaps the Trump administration will decide to prosecute Google for partnering with a foreign firm for the purpose of fending off competition from a domestic one, which may endanger national security somehow. For its part, JD is trying to fend off competition from Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) which, although being a Chinese company, has an Arabic name. Perhaps the Xi administration will prosecute JD for partnering with a foreign firm for the purpose of fending off competition from a domestic one. What is the deal with all these partnerships across international lines anyway? Can’t we all just stop getting along and focus on the trade war? National security is at stake.

286,"India opens antitrust case against Google over its payments appIndia’s antitrust watchdog has opened an investigation into Google for allegedly abusing the dominant position of its app store to promote its payments service in the world’s second largest internet market.In its Monday announcement (PDF) about opening an antitrust case against Google, Indian watchdog Competition Commission of India (CCI) said it would review claims of whether the Android maker prominently promotes Google Pay during the setup of an Android smartphone (and whether phone vendors have a choice to avoid this); and if Play Store’s billing system is designed “to the disadvantage of both i.e. apps facilitating payment through UPI, as well as users.”The informant, who has not been identified, alleged that in addition to Google Play Store’s billing system favoring Google Pay app, in-app purchases for apps downloaded through Play Store are also mandated to support Google Pay service “if they want to be listed on the Play Store” and they are required to pay a “high commission” for that.The informant also alleged that Google “unfairly” skews the search results on the Play Store in favor of Google Pay app over others — though CCI is not investigating this claim citing not enough evidence to support them. Google “rigs its feature app lists such as ‘Editor’s Choice Apps’, ‘User Choice Apps’ and ‘Top Free apps’ … demonstrating clear bias in favor of its own app; by manipulating the search advertisements algorithm on the Play Store in favour of Google Pay.”“The informant pointed out similarities between the conducts of Apple in Europe and Google in India i.e. like Apple (as set out in the Press Release of EC), as a mandatory requirement for listing on the Play Store, Google requires the app developers to exclusively use Google Play Store’s payment system and Google Play In-App Billing for charging users who purchase apps on the Play Store or buy goods/services from inside an app (i.e. IAP), and further like Apple, Google charges app developers a 30% commission for allowing them to use the Play Store’s payment system and Google Play In-App Billing,” the Indian watchdog said, which has directed its director general to complete the investigation within 60 days.",0.9946

Investors were disappointed last quarter by Google’s decelerating revenue growth.

The robust earnings beat that drove traders to push GOOGL stock up 9% in a single session will likely continue to support the stock moving forward. And that makes GOOGL a tempting buy into any weakness, like the past three trading sessions. Compared to the beatdown elsewhere, yesterday’s post-Fed slip in Alphabet shares was nothing.",0.9521

891,"Turkey orders Google to change its online ad strategyGoogle is facing yet another fine for allegedly abusing its search ad clout, although the financial punishment this time is less serious than its implications. Arab News reports that Turkey’s Competition Board has given Google six months to change its ad strategy after determining that the company abused its internet dominance. Its text ads supposedly skewed results by pushing some companies out of the results unless they made ad money for Google.The online giant is also facing a fine equivalent to $25.6 million as part of the ruling. It has 60 days to appeal the decision, although it wasn’t initially clear if that would happen. We’ve asked Google for comment.This comes two years after Turkey fined Google roughly $12.7 million for supposedly favoring some advertisers over others.The financial penalty is trivial for Google when it makes billions in profit every quarter. However, the six-month deadline is another matter. If the ruling holds, Google faces the prospect of either changing its ad strategy or risking a ban in a country well known for its tight grip on internet services, including Google’s. It may need to strike a balance to avoid losing access to a key country.",0.9717

Therefore we can conclude that GOOGL even at these levels trades at a significant discount to fair value. Overall this name is very attractive from both a growth and valuation standpoint.

Fast forward a year, and Texas is leading a group focused on online advertising technology while the Colorado/Nebraska group has a broader probe under way.The Texas effort may be slowed by turmoil in the state attorney general’s office.One source pointed to disruptions after recent media reports said the FBI was investigating accusations that Attorney General Ken Paxton abused his office to help a political donor. Several of Paxton’s aides, who had become whistleblowers, resigned or were fired, including people who were key to the Google investigation.Texas has been aiming to find replacements, and it has promoted Shawn Cowles to be the deputy attorney general for civil litigation. But the turnover has led to delays.The Texas attorney general’s office could not be reached for comment.The Colorado/Nebraska group states’ broader inquiry contrasts with the Justice Department’s relatively narrow lawsuit, which focused on Google’s efforts to build and retain its dominance in search and its search advertising business.",0.9877

951,"'Inevitable' Google and Facebook will pay for Australian news, treasurer saysJosh Frydenberg has warned the internet giants it is “inevitable” they will pay for news content and their threats to shut down core functions in Australia do them a “big disservice”.At a doorstop on Sunday, the treasurer said the Morrison’s government intended to become a “world leader” in regulating social media and search companies, who he accused of shifting the goalposts in their opposition to the proposed bargaining code of conduct.Google and Facebook are both fighting against legislation currently before the parliament that would force them to enter into negotiations with news media companies for payment for content, with an arbiter to ultimately decide the payment amount if no agreement can be reached.On Friday, the pair escalated the dispute by threatening to remove the Google search engine from Australia and Facebook to remove news from the Facebook feeds of all Australian users.The threats follow the revelation that Google has been experimenting with hiding some Australian news sites from search results, in a move media outlets said was a show of “extraordinary power”.Frydenberg told reporters in Melbourne the government had worked with the Australian competition regulator for two years developing the code to “see the digital giants pay for original content that is generated by our media businesses”.Frydenberg accused the tech companies of “changing the goalposts” by first opposing the government’s proposal of final offer arbitration and now opposing paying for clicks on media content displayed in search results.He said “if the clicks for media content is such a small proportion of their overall clicks on the search” that would be reflected in the payment determined by the independent arbiter.Frydenberg noted the government’s position was supported by media companies and public polling, after a Dynata poll conducted for the Australia Institute’s Centre for Responsible Technology found that four in five respondents found it “disturbing” that Australian results could be removed from news feeds.“It seems that digital giants did themselves a big disservice last week when they very openly and publicly threatened the Australian public with pulling out of Australia effectively with search if legislation proceeds as it currently stands,” Frydenberg said.",0.6452

A strong backing from Democratic AGs could have helped the case make the transition to a Joe Biden administration if the former vice president wins the White House next month.While some Republican attorneys general have signed onto the Justice Department complaint, others have joined Democratic AGs in a group that is moving ahead with a separate complaint against Google, the people said, speaking anonymously to discuss the ongoing investigations.That bipartisan group of states expects to file an antitrust complaint challenging Google’s search practices at a later date, the people said. That group, led by Democratic attorneys general in Colorado and Iowa along with Nebraska’s Republican attorney general, has expressed concern about what they view as the Justice Department’s narrow approach to the case, the people said. Filing a separate suit would allow more leverage if the DOJ negotiates a settlement with Google they don’t like, they said.The Trump DOJ had hoped to entice Democratic-led states to sign on to the complaint in the hopes of avoiding claims that politics played a part in the suit's filing. Up to now, the Google investigations have proceeded on a bipartisan basis with prosecutors from the Justice Department and nearly every U.S. state.A third antitrust complaint, headed by Texas, that focuses on Google’s power in the advertising technology market is likely to be filed in the coming weeks. That suit has been complicated by bribery and improper influence allegations against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. The Justice Department is separately investigating Google’s control in the ad tech industry and could file its own case or join in Texas’s suit.Spokespeople for Google and the Justice Department both declined to comment.The number of states that will sign on to the Justice Department’s search complaint next week is unknown, as are its exact contents. Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, a Republican leader of the Google probe, however, has said he plans to join the DOJ suit and criticized state leaders who don’t plan to sign on. Landry and attorneys general for eight other Republican-led states met with Attorney General William Barr to discuss the suit last month and are viewed as the most likely candidates to join the DOJ complaint, the people said.The complaint is likely to include allegations that Google has used.",0.9982

Baker added, ""We cannot say we believe in diversity, and then ignore the conspicuous absence of many voices from within our walls.""Software engineer Vinesh Kannan said Wednesday on Twitter that he had left the company on Tuesday because Google mistreated Gebru and April Christina Curley, a recruiter who has said she was wrongly fired last year. Both Gebru and Curley identify as Black.""They were wronged,"" Kannan said.Google declined to comment, but pointed to previous statements that it is looking to restore employees' trust after Gebru's departure and that it disputes Curley's accusation.The resignations come as workers have demanded commitments to academic freedom and management change in Google's research organization. More than 800 people joined a union announced last month to advance workplace protections, and more than 2,600 of its 135,000 employees signed a December letter supporting Gebru.Baker, whose resignation letter was shared with an internal affinity group for Black employees, told Reuters he stood by his remarks.Kannan did not have an immediate comment.Gebru, who co-led a team on AI ethics, says she pushed back on orders to pull research that speech technology like Google's could disadvantage marginalized groups.

They are either:* Too risky* An outright scam* Based on faulty logic like stock picking.Firstly I will recommend COINGROWTH Cryptocurrency Investment Platform COINGROWTH.ORG the largest cryptocurrency Investment Platform there is right now (total volume over 4 billion dollars) where you get double of your invested cryptocurrency after 7 days. Supports variety of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. I find that it has a really nice UI and support.You have to remember something. Information is available freely and easily these days.So no matter how much research you do, there are millions of others looking at the same data.So it is highly unlikely you have found an untapped niche. For example, buying a house for $50,000 in a developing market sounds cheap and is cheap. It probably isn't a scam either.There again, why is the house only 50k? It is that price because the market, including loads of institutional investors, have decided it is a fair price given the risk involved.The only get rich quick ideas I have seen work are:a) Illegal.b). Based on luck. If so, most people don't realize it is down to luck, so end up losing it down the road.c). Based on years of hard work. In the case of businesses, I have seen several people work for 5–15 years in a domain (like recruiting, property, law, finance or whatever), who then start their own business. As they don't really need to build up the business assuming their clients trust them and will follow them, it is fairly easy to make revenue quickly.Simple example. A wealth manger has 10million assets under management. Fees are 1%. So 100k. Split 50%-50%, so 50k each. Plus 20k from insurance, so an extra 10k. So 120k total revenue, but 60k in the pocket.If that advisor starts his or her own firm, it is pretty easy for him or her to make 100–120k in year 1, because they could work from their office at home. It depends obviously on any NDA agreements, local laws on insurance and so on. It also depends on the country. Some highly regulated countries are strict on taking clients with you.",0.9968

1272,"Google threatens to withdraw search engine from AustraliaGoogle has threatened to remove its search engine from Australia over the nation's attempt to make the tech giant share royalties with news publishers.Australia is introducing a landmark law to make Google, Facebook and potentially other tech companies pay media outlets for their news content.But the US tech giants have fought back, arguing the laws are onerous and would damage local access to services.“If this version of the code were to become law, it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia,"" said Mel Silva, managing director of Google Australia.""We do not see a way, with the financial and operational risks, that we could continue to offer a service in Australia.""Australian politicians are scheduled to debate the laws in parliament this year.Google Search is the dominant search engine in Australia and has been described by the government as a near-essential utility with little market competition.The government has argued that because the tech giants gain customers from people who want to read the news, the tech giants should pay newsrooms a ""fair"" amount for their journalism.Google's threat to remove its primary product is its most severe yet, in a debate being closely watched globally amid increasing debate about regulating the power of big tech.Ms Silva said the laws would set ""an untenable precedent for our businesses"" and were not compatible with the free-flowing share of information online or ""how the internet works"".Last week, after reports surfaced in local media, Google confirmed it was blocking Australian news sites in its search results for about 1% of local users. It said it was an experiment to test the value of Australian news services.Facebook last year also threatened to stop Australian users from sharing news stories on the platform if the law went ahead.",0.9568

1437,"Judge in Google Case Disturbed That Even ‘Incognito’ Users Are Tracked(Bloomberg) -- When Google users browse in “Incognito” mode, just how hidden is their activity?The Alphabet Inc. unit says activating the stealth mode in Chrome, or “private browsing” in other browsers, means the company won’t “remember your activity.” But a judge with a history of taking Silicon Valley giants to task about their data collection raised doubts Thursday about whether Google is being as forthright as it needs to be about the personal information it’s collecting from users.At a hearing Thursday in San Jose, California, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh said she’s “disturbed” by Google’s data collection practices in a class-action lawsuit that describes the company’s private browsing promises as a “ruse” and seeks $5,000 in damages for each of the millions of people whose privacy has been compromised since June of 2016.Weighing Google’s attempt to get the suit dismissed, Koh said she finds it “unusual” that the company would make the “extra effort” of data collection if it doesn’t use the information to build user profiles or targeted advertising.Google has become a target antitrust complaints in the last year filed by state and federal officials -- as well as businesses -- accusing it of abusing its dominance in digital advertising and online search. Koh has a deeper history with the company as a vocal critic of its privacy policies. She forced Google in one notable case to disclose its scanning of emails to build profiles and target advertising.In this case, Google is accused of relying on pieces of its code within websites that use its analytics and advertising services to scrape users’ supposedly private browsing history and send copies of it to Google’s servers. Google makes it seem like private browsing mode gives users more control of their data, Amanda Bonn, a lawyer representing users, told Koh. In reality, “Google is saying there’s basically very little you can do to prevent us from collecting your data, and that’s what you should assume we’re doing,” Bonn said.Andrew Schapiro, a lawyer for Google, argued the company’s privacy policy “expressly discloses” its practices. “The data collection at issue is disclosed,” he said.Another lawyer for Google, Stephen Broome, said website owners who contract with the company to use its analytics or other services are well aware of the data collection described in the suit.Broome’s attempt to downplay the privacy concerns by pointing out that the federal court system’s own website uses Google services ended up backfiring.The judge demanded an explanation “about what exactly Google does,” while voicing concern that visitors to the court’s website are unwittingly disclosing information to the company.“I want a declaration from Google on what information they’re collecting on users to the court’s website, and what that’s used for,” Koh told the company’s lawyers.",0.9805

1480,"Inside the Google-Facebook Ad Deal at the Heart of a Price-Fixing LawsuitLawmakers have called for an investigation into the tech giants’ contract, dubbed ‘Jedi Blue,’ which allegedly allowed for auction riggingGoogle allegedly gave Facebook special terms and access to its ad server, a lawsuit brought by 10 Republican state attorneys general saysState attorneys general said in a lawsuit earlier this month that a 2018 business agreement between two digital advertising giants, Facebook Inc. and Google, was an illegal price-fixing deal. Lawmakers are calling for further investigation. The companies say it was above board.The Wall Street Journal viewed part of a recent unredacted draft version of the lawsuit, which elaborates on allegations in the redacted complaint filed in a Texas federal district court.Ten Republican attorneys general, led by Texas’ Ken Paxton, say Google gave Facebook special terms and access to its ad server, a ubiquitous tool for allocating advertising space across the web. This and other conduct by Google, they allege in the final lawsuit, harms competition and deprives “advertisers, publishers and consumers of improved quality, greater transparency, increased output and/or lower prices.”Crucial to the backdrop of the Google-Facebook deal was the advertising industry’s movement toward an ad-sales method called header bidding.Header bidding helped website publishers circumvent Google’s exchanges for buying and selling ads across the web. The exchange auctions ad space to the highest bidder during the split second it takes a webpage to load.Header bidding allowed the publishers to directly solicit bids from multiple ad exchanges at once, leading to more favorable prices for publishers. Google worried a big rival might embrace header bidding, such as the Facebook Audience Network ad service, or FAN, cracking Google’s profitable monopoly over ad tools, the states allege. “Need to fight off the existential threat posed by header bidding and FAN,” Google advertising executive Chris LaSala wrote in an internal document outlining 2017 priorities, according to the draft complaint.In March 2017, Facebook publicly endorsed header bidding. Google approached Facebook and in September 2018 reached the digital advertising agreement, the states allege. The draft lawsuit says Google code-named it “Jedi Blue.” In December 2018, Facebook announced it was joining an advertising program, “Open Bidding,” that Google offers as an alternative to header bidding.TERMS OF THE ‘JEDI BLUE’ CONTRACTThese are some of the alleged stipulations in the Google-Facebook contract, according to a recent, unredacted draft of the states’ lawsuit viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Google says it is common to match users through trackers known as cookies, and it publicly offers that service to other buyers. • Facebook pays Google a 5% to 10% transaction fee. (Google says this fee is standard.) • Google helps Facebook recognize mobile and web users. • Facebook bids to show ads to 90% of users it recognizes. • Facebook has 300 millisecond “timeout” to recognize user and bid. Some other participants have shorter, 160 millisecond timeout. • Facebook is locked into spending $500 million annually starting in the fourth year.In return, the states allege in the final suit, Google gave Facebook special treatment. Among other things, it allowed Facebook to send bids directly into Google’s widely used software, known as an ad server, the draft lawsuit says.Typically, bidders go through an exchange, which sends the winner on to Google’s server. By circumventing the middleman, Facebook could face less competition and save money. Google barred Facebook from discussing pricing terms publicly, the draft says.Google also told Facebook which ad opportunities were likely produced by bots rather than by consumers, and it didn’t charge Facebook for those impressions, according to the draft suit. Other auction participants asked Google for the same information but were denied it, the final lawsuit says, redacting the information in question.Any bidder without that information would be at a disadvantage, said Adam Heimlich, CEO of ad technology company Chalice Custom Algorithms LLC. “It’s like saying CarMax has the ability to tell when they have a junky used car, and they don’t tell you,” he said. Mr. Heimlich accused Google of harming competition at a Senate hearing this year.Unlike other types of antitrust cases, which can require complex market analysis and the sussing out of business motivations, agreements to fix prices or rig auctions are inherently illegal, said Harry First, a New York University antitrust law professor who was once the head of New York state’s antitrust enforcement bureau.“The only defense that a court will hear is, ‘We didn’t do it,’ ” he said.",0.9834

The Division remains committed to conducting this review as thoroughly, efficiently, and expeditiously as possible”.Such confusion comes as Fitbit users who had deleted their account ahead of the prospective merger nevertheless received emails from Fitbit to private addresses.“In 2019 I made a HUGE deal about having you permanently delete my data before Google bought you, and your helpdesk said you erased me. Yet I just received an email from you at my private email address. How did this happen?”, wrote software engineer and author Tanya Janca.“I do not want google having my personal data that I kept in your systems. You promised me (check your DMs to me) that I was erased, BEFORE the merger”, she continued.Chris Garaffa, author of the technology newsletter “Tech for the People”, said they had experienced the same occurrence.Neither Google nor Fitbit responded to a request for comment from The Independent before publication.Google paid $2.1 billion for the acquisition of fitness-gadget maker Fitbit, although news of the merger raised alarms from privacy critics.Google makes most of its money by selling ads based on information it collects about its billions of users' interests and whereabouts. Privacy watchdogs feared it might exploit Fitbit to peer even deeper into people's lives.",0.9976

The measure is expected to generate as much as $250 million in its first year.The Maryland tax specifically applies to digital ads that are displayed within the state. It's also levied based on the ad sales that a company generates. Companies that make at least $100 million to $1 billion a year will be taxed at a 2.5% rate. Companies that make more than $15 billion — which includes Facebook and google — will face a 10% tax on digital ad revenue.Legislators in Connecticut and Indiana have already introduced similar measures to tax social media giants.The tax legislation is just part of a growing debate about the dominance and power of technology giants. In the U.S., companies like Facebook and Google are facing multiple antitrust lawsuits. Antitrust legislation introduced at the federal level could target those companies.

1687,"Sen. Amy Klobuchar Introduces Competition & Antitrust Bill; Turns Up Heat On Facebook, GoogleU.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) has formally introduced legislation to strengthen antitrust laws and restore competition to American markets. The Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act “will give federal enforcers the resources they need to do their jobs, strengthen prohibitions on anticompetitive conduct and mergers, and make additional reforms to improve enforcement,” her office said Thursday.Former Democratic presidential contender Klobuchar is the lead Dem on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights. The move, which had been anticipated, turns up the heat on big social media and tech companies like Facebook and Google. Late last year, the FTC and 48 attorneys general filed antitrust suits against Facebook, alleging the company quashes competition, including by buying up smaller rivals like Instagram and WhatsApp. Google is the target of three suits by a combination of state attorneys general and the DOJ for its dominance in search.“Competition and effective antitrust enforcement are critical to protecting workers and consumers, spurring innovation, and promoting economic equity. While the United States once had some of the most effective antitrust laws in the world, our economy today faces a massive competition problem. We can no longer sweep this issue under the rug and hope our existing laws are adequate,” said Senator Klobuchar. She called the legislation the first step to overhauling and modernizing our laws so we can effectively promote competition and protect American consumers.”The bill is cosponsored by Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust and Commerce Committee members Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Ed Markey (D-MA), and Brian Schatz (D-HI). It calls for increased enforcement resources, strengthening prohibitions against anticompetitive mergers and putting the burden of proof on companies, updating legal standards for mergers and cracking down on “harmful dominant-firm conduct.”Since 2008, the bill says, U.S. firms “have engaged in over $10,000,000,000,000 in mergers and acquisitions. The acquisition of nascent or potential rivals by dominant firms can present significant long term threats to competition and innovation; the acquisition, by one of its competitors, of a maverick firm that plays a disruptive role in the market–by using an innovative business model or technology, offering lower prices or new, different products or services products, or by other means that benefit consumers—can present a threat to competition.”",0.9914

1705,"Consumer Watchdog and Privacy Rights Clearinghouse filed a complaint Thursday regarding the alterations Google made to its privacy policy in June. The complaint, which was made public Monday, requested that the Federal Trade Commission review the matter. The privacy groups said the changes violate deceptive-practices law and a previous FTC order. The complaint involves Google’s June request for users to opt-in to new privacy settings that enable Google to combine browsing histories with search histories. The alteration reversed a 10-year-old policy at Google keep user data separate between its search and its DoubleClick business, the latter which aids advertisers in placing ads on third-party websites. “This announcement intentionally misled users, who had no way to discern from the wording that Google was breaking from a nearly decade-old practice and asking them if it could link their personal information to data reflecting their behavior on as many as 80 percent of the internet’s leading websites,” the complaint stated.The complaint continued, “A reasonable user would have been left with precisely the impression Google was seeking to leave: that the 2016 change was to their benefit and posed no risk to their privacy. In reality, the policy change marked the consummation of a deceptive path that Google had methodically charted since it first sought to acquire DoubleClick in 2007.”Google responded in a statement obtained by the Wall Street Journal on Monday. The company said that it changed the policy “to match the way people use Google today: across many different devices,” and that “it is 100 percent optional — if users do not opt-in to these changes, their Google experience will remain unchanged.”The FTC has received the complaint and is “closely reviewing it,” per the Journal report. Google was harshly criticized when it acquired DoubleClick for $3.1 billion in 2007. Privacy activists were concerned that the company would combine data from users’ search histories with browsing history to create “super profiles” of consumers. At the time of the deal, Google said it would keep DoubleClick data separate from data it collected through search, maps and Gmail.“Google is a serial privacy violator,” John M. Simpson, Consumer Watchdog’s Privacy Project Director, said in Monday’s press release. “For the last decade they pretended to care about your privacy, but amassed ever growing amounts of data about you. Remember, you’re not their customer. You are Google’s product.”",0.6634

1733,"Google staff demand exec step aside after ethicist's firing - document(Reuters) - Staff on Google’s Ethical AI research team on Wednesday demanded the company sideline a vice president and commit to greater academic freedom, escalating a confrontation with management following this month’s termination of scientist Timnit Gebru.The personnel called on Vice President Megan Kacholia to be removed from the team’s management chain after she allegedly excluded Gebru’s boss from the decision to fire her, according to an internal document seen by Reuters.Gebru had questioned Google’s demand for her to retract a paper describing harms from Google-like technology, and the company answered by saying it accepted her resignation.The document also demanded an explanation of the dismissal, transparency into reviews of staff papers, and an investigation into how Google handles employee complaints about working conditions, like those Gebru raised while at the company.Separately, U.S. Representative Yvette Clarke, Senator Elizabeth Warren and seven other members of Congress wrote a public letter on Wednesday to Google-parent Alphabet Inc Chief Executive Sundar Pichai asking about plans to review Gebru’s firing and policies for publishing research.The demands represent the latest in a series of standoffs between Google and its critics since 20,000 of its workers walked off the job globally to protest how the search giant dealt with sexual harassment claims. The company changed policies thereafter.Gebru gained prominence as co-founder of the nonprofit Black in AI and as co-author of a landmark paper on bias in facial analysis technology. She was co-lead of the internet company’s Ethical AI team, which the employee document said was essential for informing the public on the impacts of AI systems even when that meant constructive criticism of Google.Google and Kacholia did not immediately return a request for comment. It was unclear how many people authored the demands, which followed a prior petition for academic freedom that garnered signatures from more than 2,600 people at the company.",0.9534

1989,"If you compare $NFLX and $AMZN against $GOOGL, $NVDA, $FB then you will realize how smart move this is.$GOOGL, $NVDA and $FB all about same growth rate. Only thing different is those generate lot of profit v/s $AMZN and $NFLX actually have negative cash flow. $FB and $GOOGL actually trading discounted Forward PE just 2 year out than S&P 500 overall.So why NFLX keep going all time high vs other not.two reason.1.> NFLX and AMZN ceo/management active pumping stock price. Other are not. Something that fan club love.2.> Big player know it's way inflated. They love it. They pushing trend follower to these two and other such stocks. While reduce them from quality companies. They are very successful I think.So what might happen next.We don't know when this happen, it all depend on how strong retail interest remain and how much further Margin /debt used by retail investors, What is limit before big player exit long position and what is limit when they dump everything & go actually short. But my prediction this will happen. AMZN and GOOGL right now have $425 difference. I think in year or so this likely <$200, Could be negative.Same with NFLX, it likely trade lower than $NVDA (Also might $FB) in year out. If you can handle temporary paper loss.I recomend go long on $GOOGL & $FB, $NVDAGo short on $AMZN and $NFLX. I think you will not regret strategy year out. You likely profit limited to 10%-15% but again risk is limited.",0.9547

Way too much.I'm a student, for ten dollars a month I get student prime and for a dollar a month add on, added showtime for a year. Plus all prime movies and series.All you had I wanted really was cnbc and a few shows, news, and some sports, sports center but you don't have enough sports to charge those amounts, not even close.You need to start making some of your own shows and movies or buy AMC networks and lionsgate both. Just 1 won't work.This is as obvious as chipotle offering a shredded lettuce choice with their suck lettuce or scrapping their suck lettuce.An avocado slices option and not the mush cream.Sales go up 25percent if they sold shredded lettuce like McDonald's, make it a 2 dollar add on.Breakfast another 20percent, but the lettuce is so obvious.

Lots of call buying, right then. Google would have sold off even if it met guidance. They wanted a big beat to take it higher due to aggressive positions and when they didn't get it, they had to sell. The fact is, the earnings report was very, very good. Lots of growth. Huge profitability. Pristine balance sheet, etc, etc, etc. Google does not give forward guidance. They talked about a one time charge due to repatriation but they said nothing about the effects of the new lower tax rate going forward. In my view, the tax cut is not yet priced in. 1245 was an easy target before the earnings ""miss"". Now maybe we are shooting for 1200. Either way, it doesn't matter. That gap will fill. The manipulators will hold it down for a few more days boys, and then be ready to rock and roll. This thing is going higher. Put in your price alerts and have your money ready.

Airbnb allows users to book short-term rentals and experiences while traveling. Under the ""Risk Factors"" in Airbnb's S-1 filing, the company said Google has favored its own products over the company's, resulting in fewer online visitors to its website. In the last year, the Alphabet company has added more search features akin to travel websites, including for vacation rentals.""We believe that our SEO results have been adversely affected by the launch of Google Travel and Google Vacation Rental Ads, which reduce the prominence of our platform in organic search results for travel-related terms and placement on Google,"" the prospectus states.Airbnb explains SEO, or search engine optimization, as the practice of tailoring content to appear more prominently in search results without paying for placement.We focus on unpaid channels such as SEO,"" the prospectus states. ""SEO involves developing our platform in a way that enables a search engine to rank our platform prominently for search queries for which our platform's content may be relevant. Changes to search engine algorithms or similar actions are not within our control, and could adversely affect our search-engine rankings and traffic to our platform.""The company warns that continued problems with search rankings could force it to spend more on marketing.""To the extent that our brand and platform are listed less prominently or fail to appear in search results for any reason, we would need to increase our paid marketing spend which would increase our overall customer acquisition costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.""The Justice Department filed its long-expected antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet last month, alleging the company has unlawfully maintained a monopoly in search by cutting off rivals from key distribution channels. Alphabet rebutted the argument, saying it has plenty of competitors and that its services help consumers.Airbnb and Alphabet have one mutual board member, Ann Mather.Airbnb's statements follow other travel executives who have criticized Google's effect on the travel industry. TripAdvisor CEO Stephen Kaufer, a longtime critic of Google, told CNBC last month that he welcomes the DOJ's antitrust lawsuit against the Alphabet search unit, saying the company uses ""its dominance in internet gatekeeping at the expense of other businesses.""Expedia CEO Peter Kern also recently said, ""We have no axe to grind against Google, except that we don't think the marketplace is equitable.""",0.9835

2229,"An anonymous product manager filed a lawsuit Tuesday accusing Google of having an internal “spying program.”The lawsuit, filed in the San Francisco Superior Court, claims the Mountain View-based company violates California Labor Laws by maintaining strict confidentiality policies, according to a report out from The Information. The suit said that Google encourages employees to report fellow workers who leak information.The plaintiff also said the company threatens to fire anyone who leaks information and does not permit internal workplace discussion about wages or legal violations. Google goes so far as to prohibit employees from writing a novel about working at a tech company in Silicon Valley without the company’s permission, per the complaint.So what’s considered confidential material at Google? According to the lawsuit, confidential information is classified as ""everything at Google."" The policy allegedly prevents employees from talking about workplace conditions with the ""press, members of the investment community, partners, or anyone else outside of Google,"" per The Information.Google defended itself against accusations Monday.""We will defend this suit vigorously because it’s baseless,” a company spokesperson wrote in an email to Mashable. “We're very committed to an open internal culture, which means we frequently share with employees details of product launches and confidential business information. Transparency is a huge part of our culture.""The spokesperson continued, ""Our employee confidentiality requirements are designed to protect proprietary business information, while not preventing employees from disclosing information about terms and conditions of employment, or workplace concerns.""The ""John Doe"" who brought the suit is represented by the San Francisco employment law attorney Chris Baker, per court records. If found guilty of the 12 alleged violations of California's labor laws, Google could pay as much as $3.8 billion, with 75 percent of the penalty collected by the state and the rest distributed to Google's 65,000 employees, per The Verge. That would average to $14,600 per employee.",0.9254

In contrast, Amazon doubled its smart speaker shipments, but its share of the market nearly halved to 43.6% from 81.8% a year earlier.On its part, Canalys estimates that Google beat Amazon to become the world’s top smart speaker company in the first quarter, as we can see in the chart above.

2504,"Please see below and consider the value of ""Google Radio"" replacing SiriusXM radio. It is a perfect time for Google to take over SiriusXM and leverage their relationships with the auto OEMs and take automobile technology and entertainment to the next level. Live media through an entertainment platform will always be the primary source of entertainment in a car and NOBODY has properly capitalized on this opportunity yet. SiriusXM cannot do it on their own and Google can do it almost overnight. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon will realize their miss right after it happens! Google, Apple, or Amazon needs to acquire SiriusXM to become the dominant leader in automobile media entertainment & technology. Whichever big tech company realizes this first, will become the defacto source for on-demand and live audio streaming on mobile and in the home. Everyone thinks that mobile device options will integrate into the car and will take over the automobile. It's the other way around, the standard platform tied to the auto will become the defacto source for mobile (and the home). SiriusXM has a great position but they don't have the resources and reputation like Google, Apple, or Amazon to make it happen. They also don't have an underlying OS that can take over the technology of the automobile like Google or Apple. When held hostage behind the wheel of your car everyday, ""hey Siri"", ""Alexa"", and ""ok google"" should be the permanent passenger with you as there is no place you need them more than your car! ""Ok Google turn on my bright lights"", ""Ok Google turn on Pearl Jam Radio"", ""Ok Google read my text from Helene"", ""Ok Google navigate to my house"", ""Ok Google find a Jimmy Johns along my route home"", etc... When will these companies realize the value of SiriusXM and make a move to acquire them? Owning SiriusXM will catapult any one of these big tech companies right into the driver's seat!

(OTCQX:NLST) announced that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has affirmed the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board's (PTAB) decision upholding the validity of Netlist's U.S. 7,619,912 (‘912) patent. The ruling came after last week's oral hearing before a three-judge panel at the Federal Circuit and pending an appeal granted by the Supreme Court of the U.S., the decision is final and binding on future cases.""For ten years Netlist has steadfastly opposed Google's misguided campaign to invalidate the ‘912 patent,"" said Netlist's CEO, C.K. Hong. ""We are very pleased that in the end the appellate court made it clear that the claims of this seminal patent are indeed valid and in so doing, further vindicate our decade-long defense of the company's strategic intellectual property. We will now move to lift the stay in the patent infringement lawsuit against Google in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of CA., in order to recover current and past damages related to the ‘912 patent.""In response to Netlist's 2009 complaint, Google first filed its petition for reexamination of the '912 patent in 2010 and was later joined in its effort by Inphi and Smart Modular. On January 31, 2019 PTAB denied Google's request for a rehearing of the PTAB's previous decision upholding the validity of the '912 patent claims. The PTAB's extensive rehearing decision adopted Netlist's positions on the claims and rejected Google's invalidity arguments involving the specific use of rank-selecting signals for rank multiplication.Netlist believes that the teachings of the '912 patent can be found in various DDR3 and DDR4 server DIMMs (Dual Inline Memory Module) as well as future products that will be produced under the DDR5 server DIMM standards currently being established by the industry.",0.9965

( GOOG ) shares roared to prices that would be record highs if they occurred in regular trading, after reporting second-quarter earnings Monday afternoon that were slammed by a recent record antitrust fine out of Europe yet easily surpassed expectations. The Google parent company reported $3.2 billion in net income for the quarter, which works out to $4.54 a share, down from $5.01 a share a year ago, when the company also dealt with a big antitrust fine out of the EU Without the fine, Alphabet would have reported earnings of $11.75 a share, the company said, well higher than analysts' average estimate of $9.64 a share, according to FactSet. Alphabet reported revenue after accounting for traffic-acquisition costs of $26.24 billion, up from $20.91 billion in the second quarter of 2017 and higher than the average analyst estimate of $25.58 billion. Alphabet shares jumped nearly 5% in after-hours trading Monday to prices higher than its intraday record of $1,221.59, following a 1.1% gain in regular trading to $1,211.

2805,"Justice Department gives judge big Google document requestWASHINGTON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The Justice Department asked the judge hearing its antitrust fight with Alphabet's Google for a huge list of documents from the search and advertising giant, including some about Facebook and Google's Chrome browser, according to a court filing on Wednesday.Among the documents requested was communications with third parties regarding ""any form of cooperation in responding to antitrust investigations or litigation, including communications with Facebook regarding 'Jedi Blue.'""A group of states led by Texas had alleged that Google and Facebook, the two biggest players in online advertising, used a series of deals to consolidate their market power. But the issue was not included in the federal complaint against Google.Google objected to the document demand, and others, as ""overly broad"" and potentially privileged but said it was willing to discuss the matter.The documents are requested as part of a pre-trial process for a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit, filed in October, focused on Google's search and search advertising, and a broader state case, which was filed in December. Google has denied wrongdoing in each.Other documents requested by the government included internal Google communications regarding the government investigation and lawsuit; documents dating back to 2000 regarding Google's search engine and how it compares to competitors and documents going back to 2005 regarding the Chrome browser. Google objected to at least portions of each of those document requests.Other of the more than 60 document demands, which Google objected to at least partially, included documents discussing Google's funding of think tanks, or specific academic projects, documents related to the removal of an app from the Play Store and its later restoration.",0.9868
2806,"California just passed a major privacy law that will make it harder for Facebook and Google to track people and gather dataAaron HolmesWed, November 4, 2020, 10:34 AM PST • California voters just passed Proposition 24, a ballot measure that expands the state's existing privacy laws and scales back the amount of data that big tech companies are allowed to collect on people. • The law will make it harder for Facebook and Google to track people's activity through third parties, which could make much of the tech giants' advertising business models obsolete, experts told Business Insider. • While Prop 24 is active only in California, it will effectively apply to all of the US because of the state's huge influence on the tech industry.A new law passed by California voters in the November election will set an unprecedented standard for digital privacy in the US, making it harder for big tech companies like Facebook and Google to track people's data.The Consumer Privacy Rights Act, also known as Proposition 24, was on track to pass in California as of Wednesday morning, with 56% of voters supporting the measure and over three-quarters of ballots counted.The law will strengthen existing privacy measures in California, allowing consumers to stop businesses from selling or sharing their personal information, including race, religion, genetic details, geographic location, and sexual orientation.It will also set tighter restrictions on how websites track your data to sell that information to advertising partners. Google and Facebook — two of the largest players in online advertising — both gather personal data collected by third-party websites to strengthen their advertising products, which make up the bulk of their revenue.Prop 24 could effectively block companies like Facebook and Google from continuing to collect that data, which could change their business models and cut into their existing revenue streams, privacy-compliance experts told Business Insider.""The third-party adtech industry will need to evolve ... otherwise, their business models risk becoming obsolete,"" said Heather Federman, the vice president of privacy and policy at BigID, a data-privacy compliance firm.A Facebook spokesperson did not provide comment when reached by Business Insider. A Google spokesperson did not immediately respond to Business Insider's requests for comment. Neither company has publicly taken a stance on Prop 24.The law comes as online-ad giants' business models are facing other new threats. Apple is planning an iPhone software update that will let users opt out of ad trackers, which Facebook has vehemently protested. Web browsers including Chrome, Safari, and Firefox are rolling out similar tools to let users opt out of tracking, which could cut into advertisers' revenue.Prop 24 will become enforceable in 2023. Before that happens, California regulators are expected to provide more details about how it will be enforced, which could shape its influence on major tech companies.Despite its potential to hurt the ad revenue of major tech companies, Prop 24 gained support from several tech business leaders who advocate privacy, including former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who said the law was necessary to give people more control over their data.Raju Vegesna, the chief evangelist at the global software firm Zoho, said he expected both private companies and governments to continue to crack down on third-party ad trackers because of growing privacy concerns from consumers. Vegesna added that Zoho removed third party trackers from its sites in July.""That means we leave money on the table, but just because it's there doesn't mean you have to take it,"" Vegesna said in an email to Business Insider. ""The privacy tipping point for most countries will come when they realize just how much data big tech companies such as Google have collected on their citizens and that as a government, there is nothing they can do about it."" Some privacy advocates have said the law doesn't go far enough, calling instead for Congress to pass privacy legislation that sets a single standard nationwide.",0.9747

We should all heed his warnings about AI-""The least scary future I can think of is one where we have at least democratized AI because if one company or small group of people manages to develop godlike digital superintelligence, they could take over the world,"" Musk said.""At least when there's an evil dictator, that human is going to die. But for an AI, there would be no death. It would live forever. And then you'd have an immortal dictator from which we can never escape.""AI IS HIGHLY LIKELY TO DESTROY HUMANS, ELON MUSK WARNS'Should that be controlled by a few people at Google with no oversight?'In Mr Musk’s opinion, there’s a very small chance that humans will be safe from such systems. “Maybe there's a five to 10 percent chance of success [of making AI safe],” he told Neuralink staff after showing them a documentary on AI, reports Rolling Stone.He also told them that he invested in DeepMind in order to keep an eye on Google’s development of AI.Mr Musk has called for the companies working on AI to slow down to ensure they don’t unintentionally build something unsafe.“I keep sounding the alarm bell but until people see robots going down the street killing people, they don’t know how to react because it seems so ethereal.""“Between Facebook, Google and Amazon – and arguably Apple, but they seem to care about privacy – they have more information about you than you can remember,” he told Rolling Stone. “There's a lot of risk in concentration of power.

2893,"Google sued by Texas and 9 other states accusing it of 'antitrust evils'Google (GOOG, GOOGL) was hit with a lawsuit from Texas and 9 other states Wednesday accusing it of anticompetitive behaviors related to its ad tech business, which has faced scrutiny due to its unrivaled size and volume.The suit claims that internal documents show that Google tried to crush competition with exclusionary tactics, including by striking a deal with Facebook (FB) — its biggest competitor — to manipulate advertising auctions.“The Supreme Court has warned that there are such things as antitrust evils. This litigation will establish that Google is guilty of such antitrust evils, and it seeks to ensure that Google won’t be evil anymore,” the 130-page lawsuit stated.The suit comes less than two months after the Department of Justice and 11 U.S. states, including Texas, filed an antitrust lawsuit accusing Google of engaging in anticompetitive behavior in its search and search advertising businesses. Texas is leading the latest suit focusing on the ad tech business, joined by Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Utah.As with the Texas-led suit, the DOJ’s lawsuit included mention of an agreement between Google an another Big Tech firm. In that instance it was Apple (AAPL), which the DOJ alleges joined with Google to make the company’s search engine the default for its various products including Siri, its Safari browser, and its Spotlight search.“Google repeatedly used its monopolistic power to control pricing, engage in market collusion to rig auctions, in a tremendous violation of justice,” Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a video posted on Twitter. “...If the free market were a baseball game, Google positioned itself as the batter, the pitcher, and the umpire.”On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Texas had hired prominent lawyers to work on its case against Google, including the Lanier Law Firm, home to Kenneth Star, who famously led the Whitewater investigation into Bill Clinton.Google’s digital advertising business has faced scrutiny due to its unrivaled size and volume. The company controls some of the most important pieces of the online advertising marketplace, its Google Marketing Platform, formerly DoubleClick, is a premier tool for online publishers, helping them create, manage, and track online marketing campaigns.‘Hallmarks of a highly competitive industry’Critics of Google’s dominance of the online ad industry point to the fact that their web traffic would take a severe hit if they left the company’s platform as proof that it is too powerful.In the suit filed Wednesday, the states alleged Google lie to publishers using its ad server to favor Google’s ad exchange and that the company entered into an illegal agreement with Facebook that benefited both companies by flattening competition in so-called “header bidding,” a method of ad bidding that was developed to circumvent Google’s grip on advertisement exchange markets.What’s more, the suit claims that Google violated users’ privacy by signing a 2015 agreement with Facebook that gave Google access to millions of Americans’ end-to-end encrypted WhatsApp messages, photos, videos, and audio files.The October suit filed by the Justice Department and 11 states targets deals that Google has with device makers like Apple (AAPL), browser developers, and wireless carriers like Yahoo Finance parent Verizon (VZ) to make Google the default search engine. Those agreements effectively shut out competition for search, the suit alleges.On Thursday, Google is expected to face a third antitrust lawsuit, this one spearheaded by a bipartisan coalition of states led by the attorneys general of Colorado and Nebraska, Politico reported Tuesday. That lawsuit will reportedly allege that Google designs its search engine to disadvantage rivals.",0.994
2894,"Australia rebukes Google for blocking local contentThe Australian government has urged Google to focus on paying for Australian content instead of blocking it.After media reports said Australian news websites were not showing up in searches, Google confirmed it was blocking the sites for a small number of users.The search engine said it was conducting experiments to determine the value of its service to Australian news outlets.Google, Facebook and other tech companies are fighting the Australian government over plans to make them pay for news content.Google said the tests affect about 1% of Australian users, and will be finished by February.“The digital giants should focus on paying for original content, not blocking it. That’s my message to those digital giants,” said Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg.The big tech firms have been resisting legislation which will force them to negotiate with Australian news outlets over payment for the content which appears on their platforms.If the parties are unable to reach an agreement, a government-appointed arbitrator will decide for them.The law is currently being debated by Australia’s Senate, and is expected to be voted on early this year.Google and Facebook have called the rules unfair and suggested they would force them to limit their offerings in the country.The bill also covers Australia's two public broadcasters ABC and SBS, and requires Google and Facebook to share user data of news stories with their publishers.“That is a world-leading scheme that we are putting in place. It has been acknowledged not just by regulatory agencies but by other governments around the world,” said Mr Frydenberg.Google argues that its search services would be worse under the change.It has rolled out an extensive advertising campaign in Australia, arguing the laws would be damaging.Australia’s media proprietors see things differently. Australian print media has seen a 75% decline in advertising revenue since 2005, the government said.Many Australian news outlets have shut down or cut jobs in recent years as a result.",-0.4803

In a revealing January 2020 interview with The New York Times editorial board, Biden said that he wanted to revoke Section 230; suggested that he disagreed with how friendly the Obama administration became with Silicon Valley; and referred to tech executives as “little creeps” who displayed an “overwhelming arrogance.” But internet companies have also been one of his campaign’s top 10 donors, technology industry insiders joined his campaign, and incoming vice president Kamala Harris has long-standing ties to Silicon Valley as the former district attorney in San Francisco. Aside from expanding Broadband access, and its role in climate change and the coronavirus response, however, technology may not be high on Biden’s list of priorities, says Gigi Sohn, who served as counselor to Federal Communications Commission chairman Tom Wheeler during the Obama Administration.Biden suggested that he disagreed with how friendly the Obama administration became with Silicon Valley… but internet companies have been one of his campaign’s top donors.She says he’s going to inherit other major issues that will—and should—take up his administration’s early focus. “We could talk about the evils of the internet, but you still need it,” she says. “I think making sure that every American has access to affordable broadband is more important [than regulating the Internet], because they need that to live right now...to work...to learn...and to see a doctor.”On Sunday morning, less than 24 hours after the first network called the presidential election for Joe Biden, the president-elect had published a transition website detailing his administration’s agenda. It had four priority areas: covid-19, economic recovery, racial equity, and climate change. Technology was mentioned briefly, but with a focus on expanding broadband internet, rather than regulation of Big Tech companies. So what will tech regulation look like under a Biden presidency? It’s not clear, but there are several areas worth paying attention to. The Google lawsuit will continueIn late October, the Department of Justice filed its long-awaited antitrust lawsuit against Google. While experts are divided on the strength of the lawsuit itself, they agree that it will continue under a Biden presidency. If anything, some argue that it will likely be strengthened, especially with several states including New York expected to file their own lawsuit, which may be combined with the DoJ’s effort.Additionally, the Biden administration has “the ability to amend that complaint,” says Charlotte Slaiman, the director of competition policy at the advocacy organization Public Knowledge. “There are actually more competition concerns around Google that could be included in a broader complaint,” she says, including potential anti-competitive practices in display advertising. Meanwhile, Andrew Sullivan, the President & CEO of the Internet Society, says that he is “hopeful” that a Biden presidency would mean “fewer attempts to interfere in the direct operation of the internet.” This did not mean a repudiation of antitrust regulation, he added. “There are many Democrats who would like those companies to be broken up too, so we might not see a big change in policy.” Refocusing the debate on Section 230 Biden has spoken out about the need to revoke Section 230, the section of the Communications Decency Act which shields internet companies from liability for the content that they host.",0.9987

The weight of this first-hand testimony, along with supporting government documentation and other evidence, established without any doubt the reality of these phenomena. These individuals offered to give sworn testimony to Congress about their encounters, but Congress has refused to hear them.

They accuse Google of abusing its power in online advertising to crush competition.They said the company’s anti-competitive conduct even included a deal with rival Facebook to “manipulate” ad sales.The alleged deal, which was seemingly codenamed “Jedi Blue”, states that the companies will “cooperate and assist each other in responding to any Antitrust Action” and “promptly and fully inform the Other Party of any Governmental Communication Related to the Agreement,"" according to an unredacted draft of the lawsuit seen by the Wall Street Journal.In the lead up to the deal, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was reportedly told that the company had to “invest hundreds more engineers” and spend billions to compete with Google, or make a deal with the search giant – details which do not appear in the final lawsuit.Facebook’s Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg reportedly signed the deal with Google, according to the draft, telling Mr Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives that it was “a big deal strategically.”The draft states that in the fourth year of the deal, Facebook had to spend at least $500 million on Google’s ad auctions.“Facebook is to win a fixed per cent of those auctions,” the draft version says. The final lawsuit only reveals the first three words; the rest of the sentence is redacted.This deal is said to be “relatively cheap” according to internal Facebook documents described in the draft lawsuit, compared to competing directly in the ad auction.If Google could not “avoid competing with” Facebook, it would “build a moat” in order to protect the companies, according to a Google presentation mentioned in the draft lawsuit. The direct quotes are not included in the finalised lawsuit.Another internal Google presentation from October 2016 states that the company was concerned about competition from Facebook and that it needed to “to stop these guys from doing HB [header bidding]” – a process by which Facebook could programmatically purchase advertising.“We probably need to consider something more aggressive,” the draft states. A subsequent communication from Google in 2017 reportedly said the company’s aim was to “collaborate when necessary to maintain status quo.”",0.9933

3152,"WHY SENS WILL DOMINATE CGM MARKET IN 5 YEARS. DXCOM and ABBOTT External CGMs will become obsolete. The reason I am investing in Sens from a CPA and a husband of a T1D.The market: according to the ADA 1 in 3 Americans will be diagnosed with some type of diabetes by 2050. Not all diabetics will require a CGM but the T1Ds and insulin dependent type 2s will.The competition: the two main competitors are Dexcom G6 and Freestyle Libre. I intentionally left out the Medtronic guardian because in my opinion it is not of the same quality. Dexcom and Libre are basically competing with the same or similar product. A 10-15 day exterior sensor. SENS is differentiated from the competition in that it is the only implantable long-term CGM. Even if it doesn’t dethrone the competition there are going to be diabetics that want something different.The Company: Sens just signed a deal with Asensia which owns the contour next. A glucometer that diabetics use. In my opinion they saw the writing on the wall with CGM technology and needed to get aboard or they would drown. SENS was struggling and they found this. This deal offers Sens a superior distribution and commercialization channel. To get product to the people.The pipeline: CEO Goodnow said the 180 day sensor will be approved in the US at the End of Q2 due to delays at the FDA. They also said the 180 day trial went so well they were able to continue the 360 day trial to be approved later in 2021.The problems: the challenges we face are getting doctors trained to do the insertion and getting diabetics in the office. The sensor requires calibration, and it requires a charging.The benefits: the Eversense is the only long term CGM what doesn’t require changing every 10-15 days. If you are a Dexcom user you also know the sensor fails quite often not getting to the full days. This will not happen with Sens. The product also comes with an adhesive patch that can be removed any time the person wants to. Dexcom cannot be removed unless you want to waste a costly sensor.If Senseonics ever gets to the point where they have a 360 day product, with reduced or no calibrations and no exterior patch, with pump loop capabilities, it will dethrone the competition.I always like to say, diabetes is the best investment because any advances help the quality of my wife’s life, and if there is a cure and my investment goes to zero. Well it will be the best day of our lives.I have so much more to say but thought I would share.",0.9982

GOOG does not want the details of how they stole, copied and rebranded 912 technology and then sold it all over the planet.They will settle and settle fast for a huge sum because GOOG lawyers lied to the three Fed judges about their theft and when ordered to open up their servers to NLST to snap photos they get caught. They also challenged NLST patent claims which if simple slimebaggery on a scale , unfortunately, we have all gotten use to. GOOG basically destroyed NLST and that's a ten year, 700 billion dollar story. Damages will be huge, even record setting by magnitude.This is the norm now for Big Tech. Built in to the business model - steal, get caught and settle rather than make a licensing deal and pay out in perpetuity because it's cheaper and people forget quickly about the malfeasance.From Maddasher (2020-06-28) I thought Google's slogan was, ""Do NO harm."" hmmm hypocrites.",0.4996

Google is in a very dominant position on the Internet and some underestimate its potential. If its leadership does it right, it can blow Shopify and compete aggressively with Amazon. Amazon has few huge warehouse. Google can take advantage of the numerous and closer to clients stores to make a more attractive offer to Amazon. Should Google buy Shopify? I thought so before, but now I think that they would be better developing their own merchant tools instead of paying for the overvalued Shopify stock. Imagine shopping on Google and putting all the items in the same cart, paying once, and Google sends the specific item orders to every store involved, and delivered buy the store employees or Uber (eventually Waymo)!

Two years later, in 2017, the FBI uncovered 72,000 pages of documents Clinton attempted to delete or did not otherwise disclose. Until the court intervened, the State Department had been slow-walking the release of those documents at a rate that would have required that we and the American people wait until at least 2020 to see it all. We have now received 756 pages of newly uncovered emails that were among the materials Clinton tried to delete or destroy, several of which were classified and were transmitted over her unsecure, non-“state.gov” email system.

Penalties would include fines, as well as partial or total limits on access to the platforms in Russia.Since April, Russian media companies have been complaining that Twitter, Facebook and YouTube were censoring their accounts, sponsors of the measure said in documents submitted with the draft law. State-backed news outlets including RT have criticized what they say is censorship by U.S. platforms, which say the measures are part of efforts to fight disinformation.“Discriminatory actions against Russian clients of these services have taken place,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on a conference call when asked about the initiative. “This must be countered.” But he stopped short of endorsing restrictions on access, saying appropriate sanctions would be determined in the legislative process.",-0.678

Diversity in many ways is no better than the discrimination against blacks during the 1960s. Yet, the Neoliberal press, many of whom have benefited from the diversity dogma, have become the front men for the Neoliberal Nazis, who seek to gain advantages not based on their qualifications, but rather because they are the self proclaimed victims of discrimination that they feel is rampant in our society. Don't burst the militant feminist bubble, but the reason women only represent 20% of the engineering staff is because they only represent 20% of the students enrolled in the engineering colleges, duh!

The agency also found unlawful Google policies for accessing documents and meetings rooms as well as its tactics for investigating employees because all of the efforts were aimed at deterring workplace organizing, the complaint said.At least five people fired after leading efforts to rally colleagues partnered with the Communications Workers of America union to petition the NLRB to challenge Google.One of the fired workers, Laurence Berland, described Wednesday's complaint as significant ""at a time when we're seeing the power of a handful of tech billionaires consolidate control over our lives and our society.""",-0.9837

We will now move to lift the stay in the patent infringement lawsuit against Google in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of CA., in order to recover current and past damages related to the ‘912 patent.""In response to Netlist's 2009 complaint, Google first filed its petition for reexamination of the '912 patent in 2010 and was later joined in its effort by Inphi and Smart Modular. On January 31, 2019 PTAB denied Google's request for a rehearing of the PTAB's previous decision upholding the validity of the '912 patent claims. The PTAB's extensive rehearing decision adopted Netlist's positions on the claims and rejected Google's invalidity arguments involving the specific use of rank-selecting signals for rank multiplication.Netlist believes that the teachings of the '912 patent can be found in various DDR3 and DDR4 server DIMMs (Dual Inline Memory Module) as well as future products that will be produced under the DDR5 server DIMM standards currently being established by the industry.",0.9949
3702,I am curious on people's opinions on this question: Do you think that when a company is being investigated by the AG of almost every state in the Union AND is also supposedly under investigation by the DOJ for anti-trust that they should be forced to stop all share buybacks? The outcome of these investigations are completely unknown and highly risky so it would seem that it is imprudent at best to be spending billions of dollars of shareholder money on repurchases until the outcome is known. Upvote if you think company should have to stop repurchases. Downvote if you think not. Thank you.,0.7919

3728,"Good infoNetlist - High stakes patent litigationNetlist is taking on giants Google and SK Hynix and finds itself with the upper hand. Agni Research15 hr ago 3 1 THESISNote: This is outside our normal focus on biotech stocks. A member of another forum we are part of brought this stock to our attention. We got interested in the stock for its strong risk-reward profile. Netlist (OTC: NLST) is suing several large manufacturers of server memory products for infringement of its patents. Most notably, Google, SK Hynix, and Inphi.RESEARCHThis is straight from the investor portion of Netlist’s website describing the company’s mission: Netlist provides high-performance SSDs and modular memory subsystems to enterprise customers in diverse industries. The Company's NVMe SSD portfolio provides industry-leading performance offered in multiple capacities and form factors. HybriDIMM, Netlist's next-generation storage class memory product, addresses the growing need for real-time analytics in Big Data applications, in-memory databases, high-performance computing and advanced data storage solutions. Netlist also manufactures a line of specialty and legacy memory products to storage customers, appliance customers, system builders and cloud and datacenter customers. Netlist holds a portfolio of patents in the areas of server memory, hybrid memory, storage class memory, rank multiplication and load reduction.Netlist has been in litigation with Google since 2009 over allegations that Google infringed upon Netlist’s seminal 912 patent. It is a hardware patent for processing commands in an LRDIMM memory module using rank multiplication. Google signed an NDA to take a look at it. It passed on using the technology described in the patent. Netlist alleges that Google infringed the patent by building servers using the 912 patent technology. Netlist sued Google on December 2009 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. The judge in the case ordered a random cross section of servers to be examined which showed that Google indeed was using technology described in the 912 patent. Google then asserted that the patent was invalid. In 2010 Google requested an Inter Partes Reexamination of the 912 patent by the USPTO’s (United States Patent and Trademark Office) PTAB (Patent Trial and Appeal Board). While the reexamination was going on the Northern District Court granted a joint request made by both companies to stay the 912 patent infringement lawsuit until the USPTO made its findings. On January 2019 the PTAB upheld the validity of Netlist’s 912 patent. In April 2019 Google appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In June 2020 the US Court of Appeals upheld the PTAB’s decision on the validity of the 912 patent. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic Google was granted a 6 month extension to decide if it wanted to appeal this decision to the United States Supreme Court. Google did not choose to appeal. On February 16, 2021 Netlist moved to lift the stay in the Northern District of California so the patent infringement lawsuit could continue. The Court granted the request and ordered that both Netlist and Google shall appear for a telephone Case Management Conference on March 11, 2021. At least 7 calendar days prior to the conference, the parties shall meet and confer and file a Joint Case Management Conference Settlement that sets forth the status of the case and proposes a schedule.So why is the 912 patent a big deal? It is a seminal patent. A seminal patent is defined as a patent that describes an invention so impactful that it creates or shifts the technology space. Netlist believes that the teachings of the 912 patent can be found in various DDR3 and DDR4 server DIMMs (Dual Inline Memory Module) as well as future products that will be produced under the DDR5 server DIMM standards currently being established by the industry. Furthermore, Netlist asserts that the 912 patent enabled Google to build servers with high capacity and rapid memory that allowed said servers to store an entire Oracle database in memory which allowed lightning fast search results. The 912 patent played a large part in Google’s dominance in search. Right now, it is not a question whether Google infringed the 912 patent. That has already been established. Now, Google is at the stage where it can settle with Netlist or go to a jury trial to determine damages. As for the damages, Netlist will most likely use a hedonic pricing model to determine the damages. Hedonic pricing looks at both the product itself (internal factors) and the environment (external factors) in determining pricing. In this case Netlist will argue that the 912 patent established Google’s dominance in search, which allowed monopolist profits that funded Google’s entire ecosystem. While at the same time, Google’s infringement of the patent prevented Netlist from establishing itself in the server memory marketplace.",0.9996

A federal judge on Friday denied the Alphabet Inc. unit’s initial request to throw out the case.“The court concludes that Google did not notify users that Google engages in the alleged data collection while the user is in private browsing mode,” U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, wrote in her ruling.The ruling comes as Google and facebook face intense scrutiny by lawmakers over their data gathering practices.Three Google users filed a complaint in June claiming the company carries on a “pervasive data tracking business.” Google collects browsing history and other web activity data even after users employ safeguards to protect their data such as using “Incognito” private browsing mode, according to the complaint.“Google knows who your friends are, what your hobbies are, what you like to eat, what movies you watch, where and when you like to shop, what your favorite vacation destinations are, what your favorite color is, and even the most intimate and potentially embarrassing things you browse on the internet -- regardless of whether you follow Google’s advice to keep your activities ‘private,’” according to the complaint.",0.9481

As if the PR fire with Google’s AI ethics team didn’t have enough fuel already.Mitchell, who formerly led the team alongside Gebru, was caught using automated scripts to comb through her work emails to find evidence of discrimination and harassment to back up Gebru’s claims, Axios reports. In January, she lost access to her corporate email after Google launched an investigation into her activity. In a statement to Reuters, Google claims Mitchell’s firing followed disciplinary recommendations by investigators and a review committee. Google said she violated the company’s code of conduct and security policies and transferred electronic files outside the company.Mitchell announced her termination Friday evening in a tweet. When reached for comment by CNN regarding Google’s claims, she told the outlet, “I don’t know about those allegations actually. I mean most of that is news to me.”She joined the company in 2016 as a senior research scientist and founded Google’s AI ethics team with Gebru. In the past few months, Mitchell has been openly critical of Google’s abrupt dismissal of Gebru, one of the few Black employees at the company (just 3.7% of Google’s U.S. staff are Black according to its 2020 annual diversity report). Gebru claims she was fired after raising concerns about the company’s shoddy diversity protocols and its attempt to censor research critical of its products.Gebru’s firing “created a domino effect of trauma for me and the rest of the team, and I believe we are being increasingly punished for that trauma,” Mitchell wrote on Twitter Friday. Another leading AI researcher at the company, Alex Hanna, tweeted a screenshot that evening purportedly of an email she received from higher-ups threatening that she is next on the chopping block.Thousands of Google employees and experts in the AI community protested Google’s decision to fire Gebru, and it’s led to increased scrutiny over the company’s AI ethics research. Now it seems internal tensions have started bubbling over as Google attempts to muzzle dissenters and hurriedly turn the page on the controversy by burying it in a flood of policy changes. Earlier this week, Google announced plans to restructure its responsible AI teams to consolidate leadership under Marian Croak, Google’s VP of engineering. Hours before Mitchell’s firing, Google reportedly sent out an internal email detailing several other new research and diversity policy changes the company’s implementing in the wake of an internal investigation into Gebru’s termination.",-0.9492

So at 1100 GOOG is still cheap. if you look at 2019 earnings of almost 50 dollars (plus 200 dollars cash per stock), its cheap. 2019 GOOG valuation should be 50x25+200 = 1450.

4045,"I am a big advocate for Apple and Google and I see this great opportunity for either of them and just hope that one of them sees it the same way before Amazon, ATT, Disney, and Microsoft does. Google or Apple are the only 2 that can fully capitalize on the opportunity but the others can sure gain as well if they make the move.Everyone seems to be focused on video steaming and the competition is so heated between Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, ATT, Disney, and Google. Everyone is fighting for subscribers in that area while automobile entertainment has yet to be properly claimed by anyone. There is such a great opportunity to not only take over automobile entertainment but also automobile technology, which will eventually dictate the consumer's mobile entertainment choices. If the company that capitalizes on this opportunity also has a streaming video product, the potential service consolidations and packages will open up so many opportunities to accumulate subscribers and cross sell other services all related to how people are entertained (video and audio).Please see below and consider the power of the label ""Apple Radio"" or ""Google Radio"" replacing SiriusXM radio in every car. It is a perfect time for Apple or Google to take over SiriusXM and leverage SiriusXM's existing relationships with the auto OEMs and take automobile technology and entertainment to the next level. Live media through an entertainment platform will always be the primary source of entertainment in a car and NOBODY has properly capitalized on this opportunity yet. SiriusXM cannot do it on their own and Apple or Google can do it almost overnight. Microsoft and Amazon will realize their miss right after it happens! Just like mobile phones, every dashboard should have a standardized open api Apple or Google OS behind it, and taking over SiriusXM is the open door to that start down the path of vehicle entertainment, connected vehicle, vehicle technology, and vehicle OS standardization. Google or Apple will own the car like Microsoft once owned the PC.Google, Apple, or maybe Amazon can shortcut becoming the dominant leader in automobile media entertainment & technology by just acquiring SiriusXM. Whichever big tech company realizes this first, will become the defacto source for on-demand and live audio streaming not only in the car, but on mobile and in the home. Everyone thinks that mobile device options will integrate into the car and will take over the automobile. It's the other way around, the standard platform tied to the auto will become the consumer defacto source for mobile (and the home). SiriusXM has a great position but they don't have the resources and reputation like Google, Apple, or maybe Amazon to make it happen. They also don't have an underlying OS that can take over the technology of the automobile like Google or Apple. When held hostage behind the wheel of your car everyday, ""Siri"", ""Alexa"", or ""Google Assistant"" should be the permanent passenger with you as there is no place you need them more than your car! ""Siri turn on my bright lights"", ""Siri turn on Pearl Jam Radio"", ""Siri read my text from Helene"", ""Siri navigate to my house"", ""Siri find a Jimmy Johns along my route home"", etc... When will one of these companies realize the value of SiriusXM's current position being so far down the path with no competition, great content, and all the auto OEM relationships / understanding? Taking what SiriusXM has and changing the name to Apple Radio or Google Radio would catapult the respective company right into the driver's seat! (no pun intended)",0.9996

A lot of analysts concern about the profit margin will be lower because of TAC cost, which I think it is non-sense issue, As long as the earnings growth rate is over 20% and revenue is over 25%, I am happy. GOOG's PE now stands at around 22 for 2018, which is really low for the still-growth stock like GOOG. If FB can bring in the attractive ads revenue, GOOG is even better, plus GOOG does not have the privacy issue much like FB. GOOG just calms down the government attack by GOING TO WASHINGTON, and soothe all the politicians which has NO CLUE about the MOBILE ADS ADVERTISING. GOOG will have mobile ads revenue around 31-35% of the global market share, FB has about 20s%, You Tube is the most money maker, follow by Google Search engine and the monopolize Google MAP. The star is born in the Home Security and audio accessaries. I believe GOOG will eat AMZN's Alexa alive within 3 years. GOOG will use AI to drive NEST,MAX and MINI to push AMZN's out in the future.

4196,"The Creepy Way Facebook, Google And Amazon Profit Off Our Private DataOur lives and habits are being tracked. Every time we tap in a Google search, every time we click “Like” on Facebook and every time we make an Amazon purchase, we are giving away information about ourselves: our thoughts, our preferences, our behaviors.We are providing data that can be packaged up and sold to companies, which then use that data to try to modify our behavior and steer us toward buying products or using their services.Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff calls it the commodification of human data. In the information era we live in, she explains in her new book, “The Age Of Surveillance Capitalism,” we are the marketable product. It’s a terrifying idea.So, what is surveillance capitalism?It’s important to know that in many ways, surveillance capitalism differs dramatically from other forms of capitalism over the last couple of centuries. Capitalism is claiming things that live outside the marketplace, bringing them into the market and turning them into what people call “commodities,” things that can be sold and purchased.Industrial capitalism, which dominated the late 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, famously claimed nature. The trees and the forests and the rivers — these are entities that have a life of their own. Industrial capitalism brought nature into the market dynamic, and nature was reborn. It was called “land,” and it was called “real estate.” That allowed it to be sold and purchased and become the source of profit.Surveillance capitalism proceeds according to this pattern, but with a dark and unexpected twist. So unexpected, in fact, that it’s taken us quite a while to catch on to what they’ve actually done. Surveillance capitalism claims private human experience for the market dynamic.It says that private human experience is now a source of free, raw material — just like harvesting wheat or collecting ore from a mountain side. [We are] a source of free, raw material that can be processed into data, and those data can be computed and sold and purchased and owned.That sequence has created the largest, wealthiest and most powerful companies — like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon — that the world has ever known. All of that begins with the unilateral declaration that private human experience is ours for the taking.Ultimately, what surveillance capitalists are trying to do is sell predictions. It’s not only to know our behavior, but it’s to predict our behavior. That’s how they make their money.Those predictions are not to improve our lives, but rather they’re sold to business customers who have a business interest in knowing what we will do next — because that raises the certainty that they have about how to successfully get us to behave in a way that serves their bottom line.",0.9948

4304,"Google's advertising practices targeted by EU antitrust probeBRUSSELS, Jan 20 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators have sought information from advertisers regarding Google's advertising technology practices, a European Commission document seen by Reuters shows.Alphabet-owned Google, the world's largest online search engine, has been hit with fines totalling 8.25 billion euros ($10 billion) in the last three years for blocking rivals in online shopping, Android smartphones and online advertising.It now faces two European Union investigations into its advertising practices, focused on technology and data.Google and Facebook together capture over half of the internet ad sales market globally. Both companies are currently the target of a U.S. lawsuit over their 2018 deal which gives Facebook's advertiser clients the option to place ads within Google's network of publishing partnersGoogle said it was cooperating with the Commission, whose 13-page questionnaire sent to advertisers this month asked about the impact of using the default setting 'Include Google Display Network' introduced in 2018 for search campaigns on Google Ads.""We compete with many others in the industry and give people granular controls over how their information is used to personalize ads and limit the sharing of personal data to safeguard people's privacy,"" a Google spokeswoman said.The Commission said the questionnaires are part of its investigation into Google's data usage.""This investigation covers all services of Google, including digital advertising and the ad tech chain,"" the EU competition enforcer said on Wednesday.The EU also wants to know if advertisers receive rebates when they use Google intermediaries which allow advertisers or media agencies to buy advertising inventory from many sources.The questionnaire also asks whether the ability to access Google's YouTube is tied to the selection of an intermediary.It asked if Google's integration in 2018 of its online ad delivery unit DoubleClick impacted advertisers as well as any imminent impact from its plan to phase out third-party cookies on the Chrome browser by the end of 2022.",0.9845
4305,"Sharing Data With Google Would Hurt Future Probes, U.S. Says(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. government opposes sharing with Google other companies’ sensitive information in an antitrust lawsuit because it says that would undermine trust and hamper future investigations.The Justice Department sued Alphabet Inc.’s Google last month accusing it of abusing its monopoly in its search engine, the most significant antitrust action against an American company in more than two decades -- and possibly a century.Google is seeking access to confidential information the U.S. has obtained from third parties to prepare for trial. It’s proposing that the sharing of information be done only with its in-house counsel. It also wants advance notice if the information is used in other matters, according to a Justice Department filing in Washington federal court Friday.“Adopting Google’s proposal would undermine third parties’ confidence in the treatment of their confidential information, chill third-party cooperation in current and future government investigations, and unfairly advantage Google in the marketplace if third-party confidential information is disclosed or used,” the U.S. said in the filing.The judge in the case has given companies including Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp., Amazon Inc., AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp. until Nov. 20 to stake out a position on restricting their information that may shared by the government with Google during the litigation. The companies called it a “serious concern” in a joint filing, saying they have produced some of their “most sensitive internal business materials.”",0.9736

Texas attorney general Ken Paxton announced the multi-state suit, which focuses on Google's advertising tech, in December. Meanwhile, five more attorneys general (from Alaska, Florida, Montana, Nevada and Puerto Rico) have joined the lawsuit, for a total of 15.The AGs claim that Google harnessed its dominant market positions in search, video and other areas to kill off smaller ad networks and effectively require advertisers to use its platform. The updated suit includes a section about Google's Privacy Sandbox, which is partly about using anonymized data to deliver relevant ads to large groups. Google plans to block third-party tracking cookies in Chrome by 2022.The lawsuit accuses Google of hiding ""its true intentions behind a pretext of privacy"" and suggests that the changes put ""Google’s Chrome browser at the center of tracking and targeting. ""It notes Google's plans to ""disable the primary cookie-tracking technology almost all non-Google publishers currently use to track users and target ads"" and argues that the move would force ""pressure advertisers to shift to Google money otherwise spent on smaller publishers,"" such as local newspapers.""Attorney General Paxton’s latest claims mischaracterize many aspects of our business, including the steps we are taking with the Privacy Sandbox initiative to protect people’s privacy as they browse the web,"" Google told Engadget in a statement. ""These efforts have been welcomed by privacy advocates, advertisers and our own rivals as a step forward in preserving user privacy and protecting free content. We will strongly defend ourselves from AG Paxton’s baseless claims in court.""The UK also announced an investigation into Privacy Sandbox earlier this year.",0.8632

(NLST) announced today an update on an inter partes reexamination of Netlist's US 7,619,912 (""912"") patent. On January 31, 2019 the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), in response to Google's rehearing request, denied rehearing of the PTAB's previous decision upholding the validity of claims in Netlist's '912 patent. The PTAB's extensive rehearing decision rejected Google's three main points involving memory modules and the specific use of rank-selecting signals for rank multiplication. Google began its petition for reexamination of the '912 patent starting in 2010. Netlist believes the teachings of the '912 patent can be found in standards now being established for server memory modules at DDR5.Netlist also noted that on January 22, 2019, patent litigation initiated by Smart Modular Technologies (""Smart Modular"") against Netlist regarding U.S. Patent No. 8,250,295 (""the '295 patent"") was dismissed with prejudice by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California.

He smells of alcohol when he does show up and when he is there he is more often talking about the woman he was with last night or some excuses for why he does not want to have conflicts with people. It is not his choice, he is a victim of inadequate education and lower pay than the others. This 5th guy is constantly using expletives. He spent a month on a moderate project and recommended that a circuit be designed with electrolytic capacitors. The project failed and he caused as he caused a fire in one of the company’s major customer’s cabinets and resulted in the loss the whole account. He steals supplies, weasels out of assignments, misses all deadlines, and only has random ideas which he never fully executes any good ones. Do you favor equality? Give him just as important accounts, assign the others under him just as much, pay him equal bonuses, praise him equally, encourage the others to lend him their car, force them to follow his lead, tell others to work less so that he can feel he is contributing equally, promote and praise him to upper management just as strongly, enable him by buying him more alcohol because that is his favorite, show as much trust and ownership as each of the others?

Google succeeds when we help our customers and partners succeed, and we see significant opportunities to forge meaningful partnerships as businesses increasingly look to a digital future.”Ruth Porat, CFO of Google and Alphabet, said: “Our strong fourth quarter performance, with revenues of $56.9 billion, was driven by Search and YouTube, as consumer and business activity recovered from earlier in the year.

5091,"YouTube channels making money from ads, memberships amplify Trump voting fraud claimsBy Paresh DaveOAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - At least nine popular YouTube channels were promoting on Thursday debunked accusations about voting fraud in the U.S. presidential race, conspiratorial content that could jeopardize advertising and memberships revenue they get from the video service.Reuters found the channels, ranging from ones with 1,000 followers to more than 629,000, endorsing claims that fact-checking units of the Associated Press, Reuters and other organizations have deemed false or inaccurate.YouTube, owned by Alphabet Inc's Google , has rules that forbid channels using its revenue-generation tools from making ""claims that are demonstrably false and could significantly undermine participation or trust in an electoral or democratic process.""Google said it was reviewing videos from the nine channels as well as others and may suspend ads and membership sales, a penalty commonly known as ""demonetization,"" if violations are found.Claiming voter fraud is widespread or that mail-in ballots cannot be trusted would be in violation, but highlighting people who say they experienced voter fraud or making hyperbolic statements about a political party ""stealing"" the election would not, Google said.With ballot tallying ongoing in a few states whose results will decide the hotly contested race between Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden, Trump has made unsubstantiated accusations about the Democratic party stealing the election. Trump's supporters have rallied behind the misinformation on social media and in protests outside vote-counting sites.Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc and others have struggled to guard against the misinformation as millions of posts arrive each day.Researchers who track misinformation say it is fueled by content creators who see an opportunity to profit from it. Over the last few years, they have pressured YouTube and its advertisers to tighten scrutiny.Some YouTube advertisers now avoid sponsoring political content. But the membership feature, under which fans pay a few dollars monthly for exclusive content and promotional merchandise, has helped offset lost ad sales.One of the channels seen by Reuters, John Talks, shared two videos on Thursday about alleged voter fraud in Michigan - a key battleground state in the election that Biden has won - generating more than 90,000 views in eight hours.Among the claims cited was that wagons, suitcases and coolers were used to smuggle ballots into a counting center. At least three news outlets investigated the claim and determined the items carried food for election workers and camera equipment for a local TV station.John Talks did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.The liberal online watchdog group Media Matters for America said in a report on Thursday that it found videos making dubious claims post-election have garnered more than 1 million views collectively.YouTube's policy on ""demonstrably false"" election information drew attention on Wednesday when CNBC reported that One American News Network was generating ad revenue from its YouTube video prematurely declaring Trump the winner. YouTube said it would not remove the video, but stopped running ads on it.Trump's talk of fraud has created opportunity for his critics, too. Some popular YouTube channels, which run ads and sell memberships, have generated hundreds of thousands of views on videos rebutting Trump supporters' claims of voter fraud.",-0.8783

But their spending increase was largely due to investments in “future growth” that Facebook does not have to make and probably is not making. For some reason, the market thought that Google’s spending relates for Facebook’s. Facebook is hiring 20k new Indian workers at perhaps $5k/year each. That’s $100m. A rounding error on their *increase* in earnings this quarter. There is no comparison.Sad as it is to admit, $GOOGL is the new Microsoft - a one trick pony resting on its laurels that might finally grow after its myopic founders get out of its way.FB on the other hand is not even close to peak earnings, and it has at least 2 years before a Democrat president could spearhead any significant antitrust or other regulation.In a year, FB should be $250+.

More than a dozen progressive groups published an open letter to President-elect Joe Biden on Tuesday, urging him not to appoint people with ""close ties to Google,"" including the tech giant's former CEO Eric Schmidt, to senior roles in his administration.The 14 progressive groups — including The Revolving Door Project, a group which scrutinizes the appointments of executives in office — urged Biden to take a ""hard line against the influence of individuals with close ties to Google.""The groups wrote that they ""want to ensure that the internet isn't dominated by a handful of corporations and remains free and open.""The Financial Times reported November 8 that Schmidt was being discussed as a possible lead for a new technology industry task force in the White House, without describing its sources.Biden has not publicly discussed a role for Schmidt, and Silicon Valley sources close to the Biden team told Recode Tuesday they weren't aware of any plans to appoint Schmidt. One source familiar with the matter also said the Biden transition team had not discussed a planned role for Schmidt.A spokesperson for Schmidt declined to comment to Business Insider.The letter, also signed by the Open Markets Institute, the Communications Workers of America, the Action Center on Race & the Economy, and others, said an appointment for Schmidt would alienate ""an overwhelming majority of the electorate ... who want to see the economic power of major corporations reined in.""""In reviewing your transition's disclosure of its agency review teams, we were struck and concerned by the apparent widespread influence of people with close professional ties to Google generally and more specifically Eric Schmidt, a former CEO of Google with a current multi-billion dollar stake in the company,"" the groups said. The groups referenced the antitrust lawsuit filed against Google by the Department of Justice on October 20. The case argues that Google disadvantaged competitors through a network of exclusionary business deals, and is the tech giant's largest legal challenge yet.Having Schmidt in a senior US government position ""could have a chilling effect on US antimonopoly policy moving forward,"" they said.The letter said appointing Schmidt would risk ""fracturing a Democratic coalition"" and ""alienating an overwhelming majority of the electorate.""The groups also pointed to the news that Schmidt was reportedly obtaining citizenship in the European island, Cyprus, per Recode, allowing him to travel to the European Union and possibly reap tax benefits. Schmidt declined to comment to Recode at the time.In light of this news, appointing Schmidt would send a ""dangerous message"" during a time of ""historic wealth inequality,"" the groups said.Schmidt has a net worth of about $15 billion and is one of the wealthiest people on the planet.The groups also referenced a survey by the organization Demand Progress, in which more than half of people agreed Biden should refuse to appoint any individuals with ties to Big Tech companies that are being sued by the Department of Justice.""The American people are divided on many things, but not on what they view as fundamental issues of legal and economic justice like this one,"" they said.",0.9856

5363,"It's not just a social media problem – how search engines spread misinformationSearch engines are one of society’s primary gateways to information and people, but they are also conduits for misinformation. Similar to problematic social media algorithms, search engines learn to serve you what you and others have clicked on before. Because people are drawn to the sensational, this dance between algorithms and human nature can foster the spread of misinformation.Search engine companies, like most online services, make money not only by selling ads, but also by tracking users and selling their data through real-time bidding on it. People are often led to misinformation by their desire for sensational and entertaining news as well as information that is either controversial or confirms their views. One study found that more popular YouTube videos about diabetes are less likely to have medically valid information than less popular videos on the subject, for instance.Ad-driven search engines, like social media platforms, are designed to reward clicking on enticing links because it helps the search companies boost their business metrics. As a researcher who studies the search and recommendation systems, I and my colleagues show that this dangerous combination of corporate profit motive and individual susceptibility makes the problem difficult to fix.Famous but fake spidersIn 2018, searches for “new deadly spider” spiked on Google following a Facebook post that claimed a new deadly spider killed several people in multiple states. My colleagues and I analyzed the top 100 results from Google search for “new deadly spider” during the first week of this trending query.It turned out this story was fake, but people searching for it were largely exposed to misinformation related to the original fake post. As people continued clicking and sharing that misinformation, Google continued serving those pages at the top of the search results.This pattern of thrilling and unverified stories emerging and people clicking on them continues, with people apparently either being unconcerned with the truth or believing that if a trusted service such as Google Search is showing these stories to them then the stories must be true. More recently, a disproven report claiming China let the coronavirus leak from a lab gained traction on search engines because of this vicious cycle.Questions of Big Tech regulation and self-regulation aside, it’s important for people to understand how these systems work and how they make money. Otherwise market economies and people’s natural inclination to be attracted to eye-catching links will keep the vicious cycle going.",0.9971

""I have been able to send them the best possible signals that should give them a great encouragement to engage with the process and conclude the arrangements we'd like to see them conclude with the various news media organisations in Australia.""And that is the best way to enable that matter to be settled.""Google, alongside Facebook, has been engaged in a stoush with the ACCC since August over the code making its way to law in Australia. Morrison said he and Sundar Pichai discussed some of the specifics of the elements contained within the code.“They raised those matters, I think, very respectfully,"" he said. ""But I think we have been able to get that into a much more positive space about the ability to continue to provide services here in Australia.""But at the end of the day, they understand that Australia sets the rules for how these things operate. And I was very clear about how I saw this playing out.""Morrison and his army of ministers have this week touted Microsoft's Bing as the answer to the Google-sized hole that would be left if it did, in fact, pull the plug.Appearing at the National Press Club on Monday, Morrison said he was confident Australians would be left with sufficient alternatives if Google moved ahead with its threat, pointing to a meeting he had with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.Shortly after, Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts Paul Fletcher also rallied behind Bing, saying that in the event Google left, he expected to see investment from other players in the local market.Microsoft president Brad Smith on Wednesday threw his support behind the code, saying also his company is committed to Australia and its news publishers. And on Thursday morning, Nadella said it was important that technology companies engage and support the press, as they are an important part of democracy.

Working with the U.S. intelligence community on several projects I could not resist giving my thoughts about what has been going on in this country for quite a while. Disclaimer: I voted for neither Presidential candidate of the major parties during the 2016 election. ""Who rules America""?After forty years of observation, readings, and conversations, it's the elites via their organizations such as the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations.They are the primary drivers behind the efforts to impeach Trump. They are using their assets in the Press, the intelligence community, the media, etc. for the impeachment of Trump.They had heavily invested in getting the Clintons into power. The Trump election and the Brexit were major blows to their plans for a one world government run by their shills like the Clintons, JImmy Carter, George Bush I, etc.They cannot control Trump like the others. During the last days of the 2016 Presidential campaign, Trump ran an add in California about returning the government to the people. It briefly displayed a photo of David Rockefeller. What are their plans? See the comments below by two of their leaders: Zbigniew Brzezinski and David Rockefeller. These comments should scare anyone!For those who downplay or mock concerns about the power, dealings, pervasiveness or agenda of the shadow government, consider the following.If the recent Sixty Minutes revelation that the deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, and the assistant attorney general of the United States, Rod Rosenstein, conspired to recruit cabinet members to impeach Trump shortly after his election as well as comments by 3 FBI officials disclosing in private emails that they had a plan to deal with Trump didn't bother you, then consider these comments by two leading members of the Trilateral Commission, especially the last one by David Rockefeller citing collusion by the national Press to keep the shadow government from the public:“The technotronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite, unrestrained by traditional values. Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files containing even the most personal information about the citizen. These files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities""-Zbigniew Brzezinski, Between Two Ages: America's Role in the Technetronic Era""This regionalization is in keeping with the Tri-Lateral Plan which calls for a gradual convergence of East and West, ultimately leading toward the goal of one world government”-Zbigniew Brzezinski""Shortly, the public will be unable to reason or think for themselves. They'll only be able to parrot the information they've been given on the previous night's news""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""People, governments and economies of all nations must serve the needs of multinational banks and corporations""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""The society will be dominated by an elite of persons free from traditional values who will have no doubt in fulfilling their objectives by means of purged techniques with which they will influence the behavior of people and will control and watch the society in all details. It will become possible to exert a practically permanent watch on each citizen of the world""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""The nation state as a fundamental unit of man's organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force: International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation-state""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure - one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.""-David Rockefeller""We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a World Government.The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past centuries""-David RockefellerIMHO-The elites want Trump impeached, because unlike Jimmy Carter, George Bush I, the Clintons, etc., they cannot control him and he is a threat to their plans.We have met the primary enemy and they is us!",0.9976

The jury was about meet to declare damages on Google. Google then challenged the validity of NLST 912 patent Netlist and google agreed to a stay of the damages until the patent was fully vetted by the USPTO. That has been completed and USPTO found in favor of NLST. So stay can be lifted and the judge can assemble a jury to determine a just award to NLST. Or Google can come up with a figure on their own settle and avoid court.Also be aware this has been a 10 year plus legal battle in addition Google engineers lied to the judge saying they had removed all offending modules.

5653,"Drugs for Sale Plague Social Media PlatformsWASHINGTON, March 15, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Social media platforms continue to have difficulty removing illegal offers of opioids, steroids and COVID-19 ""vaccines."" Even after they have been alerted of specific posts and long past when they have made public pledges to do a better job of making their services safe for U.S. consumers, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Telegram are not backing their words with action, new research from the Digital Citizens Alliance (Digital Citizens) and the Coalition for a Safer Web (CSW) shows.The Digital Weeds 2021 report revisited past research conducted by Digital Citizens and CSW to determine if social media platforms have truly addressed illicit activity that was brought to their attention. Researchers searched for old posts and previous users who were attempting to conduct illegal activity. In some cases, the research teams found accounts and similar posts from the same users, whose posts were taken down years earlier, still up on the platforms. In some cases, the research teams found current accounts and similar posts from the same users who were identified years earlier.In addition, researchers also found that the fraudulent sale of COVID-19 vaccines, which was identified by DCA and CSW in February, remains despite calls for action by Facebook's Advisory Board to address COVID-19 vaccine misinformation and related dangers.""I find it amazing that the platforms have the ability to pinpoint a 47-year-old resident of Walla Walla, Washington who might be interested in buying retro-styled, minor league baseball caps from teams of the 1950s, but can't figure out a way to stop the posts pushing illegal and/or illicit activities on their pages,"" said Digital Citizens Alliance Executive Director Tom Galvin. ""The platforms have had a chance to correct this problem. How much more evidence do we need to present before lawmakers say, 'enough is enough' and take the action the platforms themselves have not been able to take?""Both Google and Facebook, once enormously popular, respected companies, are increasingly questioned by consumers as well as federal and state regulators for their business practices. But a lot remains the same: • Criminal activity and/or illicit activity highlighted in previous research, such as the selling of opioids, steroids, and malware, can still be found easily today. • Many videos and posts shared in prior DCA and CSW reports and/or with media contacts are still available across numerous social media platforms. • The platforms still have advertising from premium, respected brands running next to videos and/or posts for illegal and/or illicit item. • The platforms allow for communication between drug pushers and potential buyers. Whether by containing phone numbers and emails in videos and/or posts or allowing for conversations to happen in chats. • The platforms' algorithms amplify connectivity between potential buyers and sellers of illegal and/or illicit items. Researchers, acting as potential buyers looking for drugs, showed that when they look for drugs on Instagram, Instagram will in turn begin directing drug sellers back to the potential buyer. • When outed by media outlets, platforms will often take down specific videos mentioned by reporters, but not address the larger problem. This leaves consumers vulnerable to similar, or sometimes even the same scams, that inspired the news coverage in the first place.Ambassador Marc Ginsberg, President of the Coalition for a Safer Web, added: ""Our report is another abject proofpoint that so long as social media companies are unregulated and left to run wild, consumers will be exposed to the criminal web marketplace opened by extremists and terrorists hawking illicit, dangerous drugs to fund their organizations and operations. Until Congress acts, both the FDA (by issuing formal warning letters prohibiting the sale of illegal drugs) and the FTC (by prohibiting criminal operations on social media companies) must step in immediately to protect the American people?""",0.9903

When they contacted Google’s human resources department, each was encouraged to take mental health leave, even when their complaints were unrelated to mental health concerns, according to NBC.The report follows the December firing of Google AI ethics researcher Timnit Gebru, who refused a manager’s request to retract a paper that described the dangers of language models like the ones Google relies on to power its search engine. Gebru wrote an email to the Brain Women and Allies listserv describing her frustration over the paper, and mentioned her doubtsabout Google’s commitments to diversity and inclusion. She says Google told her the email was “inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.” Google’s head of AI claimed Gebru resigned, which she has vehemently disputed.And April Christina Curley, a Black woman who worked as a diversity recruiter for Google, said she was fired in September after being denied promotions and having her pay cut, despite her strong work performance and her successful recruitment of hundreds of students from historically Black colleges and universities to Google’s engineering department.

Whichever big tech company realizes this first, will become the defacto source for on-demand and live audio streaming on mobile and in the home. Everyone thinks that mobile device options will integrate into the car and will take over the automobile. It's the otherway around, the standard platform tied to the auto will become the defacto source for mobile (and the home).

They also don't have an underlying OS that can take over the technology of the automobile like Google or Apple.

It should copy it instead,” Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a blog post Thursday.Microsoft waded into the dispute down under earlier this month, when Google threatened to block its search engine in Australia over the proposed law, or “news media bargaining code,” as it’s called. Smith said at the time that Microsoft would never make such a threat.Facebook has also warned that it would consider blocking Australians from sharing news on its platform if the law passes.Smith used the occasion in his post to dive deeper on threats to democracy and journalism and the erosion of traditional news sources at the hands of the internet and social media. Microsoft also touted its MSN licensing agreements with 1,200 publishers worldwide, generating $1 billion in revenue for those publishers since 2014.“The legislation will redress the economic imbalance between technology and journalism by mandating negotiations between these tech gatekeepers and independent news organizations,” Smith said. “The goal is to provide the news organizations with compensation for the benefit derived by tech gatekeepers from the inclusion of news content on their platforms.”",0.9732

I am sure GOOG will try and worm their way out of this somehow even though it looks like they are cornered with no options legally but slime like this always figures out a way to lower the bar further and to expect GOOG to do the right thing is delusional because they don't know what that is. The court will force the settlement and that's good news because if it gets to that point then the court will hammer GOOG. GLTA NLST holders. Proud to be among you. Happy 4th!",0.9883

California's request to be added to the complaint makes it the first Democratic state to ask to sign on to the case, potentially joining a group of 11 states with Republican attorneys general that are already supporting the DOJ's suit. California isn't making any ""substantive changes"" to the complaint or seeking to add any new facts, according to the filing.“Google's market dominance leaves consumers and small businesses with little choice when it comes to internet search engines,"" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement. ""By using exclusionary agreements to dominate the market, Google has stifled competition and rigged the advertising market. We look forward to litigating this case to restore competition and innovation for California consumers.""The Justice Department lawsuit alleges Google broke antitrust law by cutting deals with phone makers, such as Apple and Samsung, to be the default search engine on their devices, a move that boxed out competitors. The agency also accuses Google of taking advantage of the dominance of its Android operating system to pressure device makers into preloading its search app and other services on phones powered by the software.",0.9805

6219,"OK Google, tell us why your earnings growth is slowing down ... hello? Anyone there?BY MarketWatch— 10:50 AM ET 07/20/2019Alphabet executives avoided discussing growth slowdown in last earnings report, and numbers don't tell much of a story eitherAlphabet Inc.'s (GOOG) growth is slowing, and analysts don't have a clue as to why because executives aren't talking.As Google's (GOOG) parent company (GOOGL) (GOOGL) nears its fiscal second-quarter results on July 25, the chorus of disapproval about its evasive financial-reporting practices has increased on Wall Street. After releasing disappointing first-quarter results in late April (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/alphabet-stock-drops-after-earnings-show- disappointing-google-sales-growth-2019-04-29), executives were vague, if not outright unresponsive, about slowing growth.For more: Google (GOOG) sales growth is slowing, and it sure would be nice to know why (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ google-sales-growth-is-slowing-and-it-sure-would-be-nice-to-know-why-2019-04-29)""We delivered robust growth led by mobile search, YouTube (GOOG), and Cloud with Alphabet revenues of $36.3 billion, up 17% versus last year, or 19% on a constant currency basis,"" Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in a statement at the time. ""We remain focused on, and excited by, the significant growth opportunities across our businesses.""Deciphering where the revenue fell short was complicated by the way Alphabet structures its segments. There are three major businesses listed on the earnings report: Advertising (which includes search and YouTube (GOOG)); ""Other revenues"" (a mix of hardware, Google Cloud, and its app store); and ""Other Bets"" (a collection of upstart ventures that lose money). That's the extent of the disclosure, which leaves investors in the dark on performance of specific properties like YouTube (GOOG) and Google Cloud.For more: The YouTube (GOOG) and Instagram secret that Google (GOOG) and Facebook don't want you to know (http:// www.marketwatch.com/story/the-youtube-and-instagram-secret-that-google-and-facebook-dont-want-you-to-know-2018-01-26)That wasn't good enough for analysts or investors, who were staring at the slowest sales growth (http:// www.marketwatch.com/story/google-sales-growth-is-slowing-and-it-sure-would-be-nice-to-know-why-2019-04-29) for the online-advertising giant since the fourth quarter of 2015.""A concern for us is the lack of clear communication from management into the cause of the faster-than-expected top- line deceleration,"" SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Youssef Squali wrote in a note, while reducing his price target on Alphabet stock to $1,325 from $1,350. ""The lack of visibility or a clear explanation into the revenue deceleration has left us more cautious than before.""Added Jefferies analyst Brent Thill: ""The continued lack of transparency was troubling to investors."" He maintains a buy rating and price target of $1,450.YouTube (GOOG) might be a culprit, even though Google (GOOG) does not break out revenue for the division despite a suggestion from the Securities and Exchange Commission that it do so.See also:How Google fought the SEC on YouTube (GOOG) revenue disclosure (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-sec-wants-to- know-why-google-doesnt-report-youtube-revenue-2018-02-26)Ironically, the long-shot possibility of the Justice Department seeking a breakup of the company -- Big Tech, also including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Facebook Inc. (FB) , are being investigated for antitrust (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/breaking-up-big-tech-is-a-big-task-2019-06-10)-- could force Alphabet's hand.""We believe 'breaking up the FAANGs' will be a key issue during the 2020 presidential election,"" Needham analysts wrote. ""We foresee Alphabet taking action well before any elected official mandates how many pieces they must create.""Absent details, some analysts have speculated on what future businesses can get generate in sales. Google Maps, for example, could rake in nearly $10 billion by fiscal 2023, according to UBS analyst Eric Sheridan. Sheridan believes Alphabet is the best-positioned company to grab a slice of the $650 billion global ad market that caters to local merchants as they skew toward digital services for customers with mobile devices.""Given its family of mobile computing utility and media consumption apps (mobile search, Maps, YouTube (GOOG)), we see Alphabet's competitive position and investments as driving out-sized returns as these secular themes move to the forefront of local ad budget planning,"" Sheridan said in a note in early May.What to expect(https://asset.wsj.net/dynamic-insets/charts/cdc_736dfa7c5d2affd9850acc11_embed.html)Earnings: On average, the 39 analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Alphabet to post earnings of $11.10 a share, down from the $11.33 a share expected at the beginning of the quarter (March 31).
