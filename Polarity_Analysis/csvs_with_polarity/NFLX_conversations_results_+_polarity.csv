94,"Netflixx to buy Viacom/CBS Netflix Should Buy ViacomCBS | About: ViacomCBS Inc. (VIAC), VIACA, NFLX, VIA, VIAB, Includes: AAPL, AMZN, BRK.A, BRK.B, DIS, FB, GOOG, GOOGL, TJune 2. 2020Paul Franke Paul FrankeContrarian, long/short equity, momentum, Deep Value(6,000 followers)SummaryThe Netflix business model is under competitive attack and risks becoming the next America Online boom/bust example of a changing technology landscape.Without free cash flow and a much larger library of media content, Netflix cannot win the coming streaming wars.Only a bold and masterful move by management to acquire a company like ViacomCBS will keep the Netflix stock quote around present levels.The Viacom-CBS business combination is almost complete and could be a long-term buy regardless of any Netflix moves.Netflix (NFLX) is in big trouble without a grand stroke of genius by management in coming months. I propose the company fix its two biggest competitive problems - the lack of both owned content and free cash generation - before it’s too late. Netflix’s middleman streaming business model between customers and media content assets will not cut it anymore. By acquiring the new ViacomCBS combined media enterprise as soon as possible, Netflix can turn lemons into lemonade. Purchasing a huge library of entertainment assets to broadcast over the internet, while immediately adding $3-5 billion in cash flow and earnings generation each year, would put the embattled Netflix stock quote back on track.Management at Netflix is rapidly coming to realize a stand-pat operating model of paying billions annually to create/rent streaming content, while its high subscription selling price per month is coming under attack by new competition, is a lose-lose proposition going into 2020. The only way forward is to make a bold move, specifically a transformative merger with an important media content owner.Sumner Redstone and his National Amusement entity hold about 79% voting control of the soon-to-be-merged CBS Corporation (CBS, CBS.A) and Viacom Inc. (VIAB, VIA). I think an all-stock Netflix deal to buy out ViacomCBS in late 2019 or early 2020 would be an ideal ending statement for his long career in entertainment ownership and production. Who wouldn’t want to become one of the largest shareholders in a reinvigorated, high-growth return Netflix? After subpar investment gains from his companies for several decades versus the media industry, a sellout to Netflix may prove to be his grandest and smartest achievement. Sometimes, the simplest answer is the best answer. Netflix’s board and management only have to negotiate with the Redstone family to work out a price.Below are graphs of some of the television/film content ViacomCBS owns.Source: CBS and Viacom Investor SlideshowDuring 2016, I outlined the argument on Seeking Alpha for Disney (DIS) to acquire Netflix when its quote was around $120 a share. The merger would have allowed Disney to quickly enter and basically control the world of streaming video/entertainment content all over the world. Apparently, Disney’s CEO, Bob Iger, did not like the steep entry fee back then, around $50 billion to buy out the premier global streaming company. Of course, feeling left behind a few years later, Mr. Iger decided to purchase $70 billion in Fox content assets, and will likely spend tens of billions more building out Disney’s streaming service about to begin in November.Now the big boys are all coming to play in Netflix’s backyard. Everyone is entering the streaming business and spending billions to become even bigger players. Disney+, Google’s Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and YouTube, Apple (AAPL) TV, Amazon (AMZN) Prime, Facebook (FB) and AT&T (T) Time Warner have all announced media content investments or new spending sprees in the tens of billions to roll out greater streaming options for consumers globally. The competitive environment for Netflix could easily turn it into the America Online situation of the 1990s tech bubble peak. Basically, AOL grew at an astounding clip to become the largest and only truly functioning Microsoft Windows (MSFT)-compatible online access company for U.S. consumers between 1993 and 1999. Then, competition and a changing Internet access landscape showed up and ran AOL into the ground. Could Netflix suffer the same fate? I have openly wondered about Netflix’s business fortunes past 2019, and have been short the stock off and on this year.Netflix is Expensive, ViacomCBS is CheapThe argument for an all-stock deal, where Netflix just mints new shares to hand out to Sumner (and a few others) for ownership of ViacomCBS, is compelling right now. CBS and Viacom are late to the game in streaming, planning to spend future cash flow and earnings to catch up. Why not join forces with the world’s largest streaming service, filling your business model void overnight, while helping Netflix to plug its major gaps? Talk about a win-w",0.9988

Other are not. Something that fan club love.2.> Big player know it's way inflated. They love it. They pushing trend follower to these two and other such stocks. While reduce them from quality companies. They are very successful I think.So what might happen next.We don't know when this happen, it all depend on how strong retail interest remain and how much further Margin /debt used by retail investors, What is limit before big player exit long position and what is limit when they dump everything & go actually short. But my prediction this will happen. AMZN and GOOGL right now have $425 difference. I think in year or so this likely <$200, Could be negative.Same with NFLX, it likely trade lower than $NVDA (Also might $FB) in year out. If you can handle temporary paper loss.I recomend go long on $GOOGL & $FB, $NVDAGo short on $AMZN and $NFLX. I think you will not regret strategy year out.

More and more insurance companies are buying into importance of CGM capabilities in reducing medical complications. The total costs related to diabetes costs just in America annually is Hundreds of billions of dollars each year. It’s much cheaper for insurance companies to pay upfront fees to get CGM implanted then pay for treatments for leg amputations, diabetes blindness, end stage kidney failures, cardiac complications secondary to untreated diabetes. There are many more conditions causing billions of dollars in Medicare due to uncontrolled diabetes. CGM device is literally life savers for millions of people around the world. Currently there is vast untapped markets for both internal and external CGMs in India, China, Middle East, Far East, South America. CGM growth will be exponential over the next decades. Lastly, Medicare will be paying Providers almost twice more to implant Eversense CGM then Dexcom CGM. Main reasons for this? It cheaper in the long run to implant Eversense CGM.

624,"How is a single ""TV channel"" with 1/5 of the revenue and 1/20 of the profit be worth 90% of Disney? Is al this hype really about content? That is absurd, and while Netflix is a fine company, it is way overvalued. If it is all about content then Disney should be 5X the market cap of Netflix. Disney has a TV channel, plus they produce blockbuster films, they own Marvel, Star Wars (Lucas Films), Pixar, ABC and ESPN (additional channels that produce their own content); plus Disney has real assets - namely two theme parks that throw off billions in profits annually and the real estate itself is valued at $3-4 billion. But business is not all about content. That is just moronic hype. Business is about making money, period. Disney has multiple streams of income and much of it is all integrated. Make a princess movie that makes $100-300 million in profit, sell gobs of profitable toys and costumes of said princess along with other profitable royalties, then charge families $400 so their daughter can dress up like the princess and eat chicken tenders with her in a castle in Orlando. Netflix has none of those highly profitable additional income streams. Any media company could easily start competing with Netflix just by streaming their content. Netflix doesn't own the pipe to its customers like Comcast who sells content and high-speed internet over the same cable, two income streams. Amazon does what Netflix does but its service costs less and you get free 2-day shipping on just about anything you order. Netflix is absolutely overvalued and I think will trade below $100 within 2-3 years. It may have peaked recently and the options market definitely is bearish on this stock. CBO market is not always right in the short-term, but often has a pretty good read on the overall prospects for a companies future stock price.",0.9928

Overeas given 150 country launch, it's hard to determine but I think last Quater it's clear, cost is raising very quickly.Now why they keep spending more on advertisement in domestic.simple:- They have to replace all customer who they losing. Otherwise it will look they start losing subscriber instead gaining and stock will tank. If stock tank, it will much harder to finance spending & also retain talent. They likely offering stock as part of their content deal as well.In otherword, This is how you can hide serious problem with either Churn Rate or harder to get new customer.It's also possible that many are keep cancelling and resigning.

1133,"Here is reason stock raise $10 for nearly flat market.After revisiting expectations for Netflix Inc.'s (NFLX) international subscriber growth, Pivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak upped his 12-month price target to $400 from $300. Shares of Netflix, after hitting a record close on Monday, were up more than 1% in early Tuesday trade. Wlodarczak increased his long-term international subscriber forecast, expecting the streaming giant to hit 250 million international subscribers by 2024, up from 230 million. In its most recent fourth-quarter earnings report, Netflix said it had 62.8 million international subscribers. ""The company appears to operate in a virtuous cycle, as the larger their subscriber base grows the more they can spend on original content, which increases the potential target market for their service and dramatically increases barriers to entry,"" Wlodarczak wrote in a note. ""All else being equal with the broader markets, as long as Netflix continues to beat and raise on subscribers we believe the stock will continue to work."" Wlodarczak also raised his long-term expectations on average revenue per user as Netflix displayed pricing power after its most recent price hike had little to no negative impact on subscriber growth. Shares of Netflix have gained 122% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 index is up roughly 15%.Here are red flags on his analysis:-This analyst see 250Million subscriber suddenly jump from already increase 230 Million count for no reason. Now from 67M to 250 Milion in 6 year, each year they need to add 30M+ subscriber. Now looking into US short history, This is unlikely. Remember Most english speaking developed Foreign country reaching saturation point. Non English speaking, There isn't much content and with licensing cost increases and focus on own content that gap will get wider not smaller.Now Value:- Clearly reaching 250M mean not much growth left. And then company likely issue $30B+ stocks over 6 year period. at current price that mean it will value at $160B + likely $20B debt so $180B enterprise value.with 250M international you will have 320M total (70M is beyond peak I think but just get over optimistic) $10M = $36B revenue, They likely spending $20B on content (Only way they can reach 320M subscriber is spend lot more on content) , $5B on marketing , $5B on servers and $2b-3B on other = $33BIn other word still generate $3B profit. Even if we raise subscription by 20% it still likely <$10B profit in 2024..If you give 20 PE and discount 35% (Growth rate), You still comeup with <$150 fair market price.",0.9943

However, recently Netflix has seen a major pullback as investors started to worry about rising competition.In just two months, NFLX stock has seen its share price fall nearly 20% after the company’s second-quarter results underwhelmed the market. To be sure, Netflix isn’t flying as high as it once was, but the firm’s commitment to creating quality content is likely to keep the service from succumbing to the increasing competition in the streaming space. Plus, although NFLX is nearing saturation in the U.S., the firm still has a huge growth opportunity in India, where its content has been well-received so far. So, while the Q2 results were admittedly disappointing, this pullback in NFLX stock makes for a buying opportunity.",0.9958

I figured Netflix would start losing US subscribers, but I didn't think it would happen immediately.And after a disastrous quarter, the CEO blames analysts for bad projections? So it is good to be losing US subscribers? Face it, the CEO is doing absolutely everything wrong. He wanted to be the new cable tv and a one-stop shop for everyone. People don't want that?

Especially when market is at all-time highs and due for sharp NATURAL pullback. Investors dont worry, just hold...but swing traders, wait for 228 to break (or come close, below 330) before getting back in this beast. Now, if NFLX does NOT go back down, then we will just wait for higher resistance swing levels, and start our shorts again for quick 5-10 pullbacks.

1670,"Hilarious. Netflix is basically Blockbuster....with a $150 BILLION market cap! Debt is soaring, content acquisition costs are soaring, future content commitments are in the BILLIONS, the company has NEGATIVE $500 million in cash flow. Meanwhile, the company only loses as ""little"" as it does because it pushes the cost of broadband onto ALL broadband customers, not just Netflix customers. The big cable companies still have tons of cash and lots of very powerful political connections. And they don't appreciate subsidizing their competitor. The political risk to Netflix is high. If the cable company lobbyists ever succeed in allowing differential internet access pricing based on bandwidth usage, Netflix will be crushed. Meanwhile, there are 4X more TV shows produced per year now than just 15 years ago. So Netflix's original content is less of a special selling point because there is a content glut out there. Meanwhile, guess who is Netflix's biggest competitor? Amazon! LOL. Betting on a company to beat Amazon or even survive the onslaught from Amazon would be risky enough at a cheap valuation. But Netflix trades at like 300 TIMES EBITDA. I think Netflix the company will survive, but there is a very real chance of the equity getting wiped out to zero at some point in the next 5 years. LOL. This valuation is absolutely hilarious. Even a run of the mill correction of 20% in the stock market will take overvalued Netflix down by 50%.Right now the stock is as high as it has ever been. Everyone has been excited about Netfix for years. But today's price shows people more optimistic than they have EVER been on ANY other day. Buyer beware!",0.9878

1749,"For the naysayers (and the longs who know a good company and investment when they see one):Netflix is a positive cash flow company, they are making money hand over fist. They currently owe more than they make, but as they gain subscribers (projected 200+ million by 2020) and pay the debt down NFLX will become one of the wealthiest companies on the planet. Companies borrow money all the time, even blue chip companies, to invest in growth and infrastructure. FB borrowed a ton of money before they were net positive, so did Sirius XM and AMZN. The math is there, and it's simple, that's why the stock price is what it is, with 79%+ institutional investment. The institutional investment wouldn't be so high if the banks didn't see a golden goose. Shorties just want to try and drive the price down with nonsense so they can make a 4-5% gain here or there, while us longs are already up over 100% on the year. I know what side I'd rather be on with this stock. The shorts are going to get burned and then cry that it's manipulation or some other nonsense. It's hilarious how no matter how well a stock is doing, there is always the ""sky is falling"" types that cry doom and gloom. If they'd care to take a look at numbers, NFLX only has a 4.5% short interest on its share float. That's literally like saying 4.5 out of 100 people think the stock is going to go down in the short term. That's extremely low. Most shorters don't have the stomach to watch a 5-10% rise above their short price, and they close with a loss; that is going to happen with the short float leading up to earnings, and we might get a nice little 2-3% squeeze on top of the next rally. If you shorties were confident in your position you wouldn't be on here day after day, hour after hour, posting non-stop ""armageddon is coming"" nonsense. But hey, good luck.",0.9958

In a survey of over 1,500 U.S. consumers, 57% of respondents said they used Netflix (NFLX.NaE), up from 55% in May 2018 and 53% in September 2017. The survey also showed that 68% of Netflix (NFLX.NaE) subscribers were ""extremely"" or ""very satisfied"" with their experience. A hefty 84% percent of subscribers said they were ""not at all likely"" or ""slightly likely"" to cancel in the next three months, though that figure was below the 87% average of the last five quarters. In the U.K., 56% of respondents said they used Netflix (NFLX.NaE), up from 49% last year. Eight percent of subscribers in the U.K. said they were ""extremely"" or ""very"" satisfied with the service, and churn levels in the U.K. were at a record low; a record 71% said they were ""not at all"" or ""slightly likely"" to cancel in the next 3 months. ""We believe that Netflix (NFLX.NaE) has achieved a level of sustainable scale, growth, and profitability that isn't currently reflected in its stock price,"" wrote RBC analysts, led by Mark Mahaney, in a note to investors. He said he also sees potential in Netflix's (NFLX.NaE) push into India. ""India could well be a source of millions of new Netflix (NFLX.NaE) subscribers over the next few years,"" he wrote, ""but the company has a lot of work to do."" An RBC review of local Indian news sources suggested Netflix (NFLX.NaE) was off to a good start; its original series ""Sacred Games"" has become highly popular in the region. Mahaney also reiterated the company's outperform rating. Netflix (NFLX.NaE) shares have gained 80% so far this year, while the S&P 500 has gained 7.6%.",0.9917

It is strange because you see companies like roku crowdstrike google snowflake etc hitting new highs. Then you have companies like amzn nflx zoom which seem to be stuck despite great earnings. Zoom I understand more because of valuation. But then how can you explain snowflake. If snowflake is this high then zoom should be higher. If roku has run 30% in a few weeks then nflx should have seen some reaction along with that. So I just see a lot of disconnects which makes it harder to invest.

But as soon as this wave is over i assure you that everyone here who is saying netflix will be below 200 will be running away with their pants down. Because when this stock decides to rally it will wipe away all these leachers. The selling has been excessive especially for NFLX. But that is what you get with this stock it is 2x more volatile than other FAANGS. Longs - Q3 couldn’t have been better for us hold on to it because that is the biggest assurance you will receive and it is good. A lot of companies have disappointed earnings this season but NFLX. Haha it made a blowout. Hold on tight longs we will take off. Nothing has changed about NFLX growth and it will bounce back just got to be able to stomach this turbulence.,0.963

Target announced: By Trey Williams, MarketWatchNetflix's valuation is the elephant in the roomInvestors shouldn't worry about Netflix's rapacious spending -- but should be concerned about its ability to grow overseas, say analysts who started coverage of the streaming company on Tuesday.Analysts at Evercore initiated their coverage of Netflix Inc. with an in-line rating and a $210 12-month price target, which represents a roughly 14% premium to current trading levels.Lead analysts Vijay Jayant and Anthony DiClemente wrote in a note to investors that there are a lot of aspects of Netflix's story that are no longer debated. Internet TV is here to stay and the growth runway is massive. Within that, they wrote, Netflix (NFLX) has a huge head start.""The platform has reached near ubiquity with the help of an effective original content strategy, and a global mass market has emerged with streaming becoming the consumer's preferred way to consume video content,"" Jayant and DiClemente wrote",0.9862

Just download the app on your phone, use invitation code ""celebration26"" when registering (it's by invitation only), and make sure to use your legal name as when they assign the coins to your wallet in the future, they will verify that if you are the person who you said you are.As far as my progress, I have mined so far about 10k coins which unofficially are worth about $8k and possibly can be worth much more when the mainnet is officially launched and the pi starts trading on crypto exchanges officially.",0.9959

Will Netflix survive? Sure, quite possibly. But should Netflix trade at the most expensive valuation of any company in the market? LOL. Just ask Excite, MySpace, Nokia, and Barnes and Noble! Competing against any ONE of Google, Facebook, Apple, or Amazon tends not to be fun or fruitful. Competing against all of them at once is REALLY not fun! I wonder if Netflix could possibly revisit its 2017 levels? In 2017 the stock traded in the 100s all year. Now, just 15 weeks later, it's trading in the 300s! Is this a permanent change?

And the pleasure that people get from watching what this company puts out literally costs them less then 50 cents a day. If people want to add Hulu or Disney+ along the way then they'll simply pay $10 to add a second streaming service. That's under $25 a month for multiple streaming services. People spend that at Starbucks during the course of a week or the first 2 hours at a bar on a Saturday night. Like you said... no one is cancelling their NFLX subscription to redirect 15 freaking dollars elsewhere for a different streaming platform. Bottom line: Stay long, ride the subscription wave to 200 million worldwide, ride the 800 pound gorilla that will start printing money within 3 years which every analyst under the sun has been saying. Sometimes the easiest money can be made in the simplest of stories. The NFLX story is as simple as they come.

It was clear that the bulls were trying to squeeze the shorts big time, but then a very big seller came in, and unloaded 1MM shares in the last 20 minutes. Why would someone do that?

So This should drop as much as $CAT drop.2.> Internet Regulation:- This again impact most to Amazon. Amazon is E-commerce giant and regulation means it will not able to do lot of thing it currently doing.3.> Internet Privacy:- This is third item:- When people think about Privacy most matter is their blogging/personal post (FB), Their Shopping ($AMZN) , Listening their home conversation ($AMZN/$GOOGL), Ability to let anyone one ($AMZN recent doorbell idea to let package deliver inside),Their TV Watching Pattern ($AMZN, $NFLX, $GOOGL).So each item has major negative impact for $AMZN and yet Amazon is least impact stock even after so much run up.This is call way over optimism.

Look for Netflix google trends, traffic analysis, and mobile app ranking overtake. In conclusion, I found that October wasn?t a smacking hot month for unique visitors. November got better. I will pause here and let you know that story changes from here. December was Netflix?s best traffic month ever in history thanks to the holidays and yes i have to give credit to bird box and bundersnatch for making that happen. Few days back a moron analyst price cut netflix from SunTrust who said it will miss. Now yes, October and November wasn?t as hot as i hoped it would be but the dude based his full conclusion from google trends. Thats the biggest mistake he made as there is a lot that google trends misses and did I point out he didn?t check December #$%$! He should be fired in my opinion or at least investigated. His words can have an impact as we live in an age of computers trading and crowd following traders we saw a 4% drop that day but later closed neutral. Google trends does not know how many people are visiting netflix domain without a G search secondly if you log in from an app it wont be able to catch that. So I also checked traffic analysis for the domain as well as app downloads. October and November again showed decent progress but nothing out of the ordinary as 9.4 million subscribers is a huge ask. Which i was worried at first but after December we might actually make it and it still could fall short.

""We continue to view Netflix as the large cap with the most potential for market cap appreciation over the next three to four years,"" Sanderson wrote in a note to investors. Sanderson said he expects Netflix to add 20.6 million subscribers next year, which is roughly in line with FactSet consensus of 20.9 million, but would be down from 2017 consensus of 22.0 million subscriber additions. This year was expected to be the streaming service's peak for subscriber additions, but Sanderson said it's more likely to come in 2019 or 2020.

3486,Yesterday CNBC focussed on Needham?s downgrade. There are all kinds of views but what I find disingenuous is that cnbc only published the negative one. There are four other updates from analyst. Bernstein at 422 yesterday. JP Morgan at 425 yesterday and stifel at 400 day before. piper jaffray today at 400. No mention of those at all. It also falls pre mkt because a network knows CNBc is going to focus on the negative one and starts shorting. Easy money. The flaw in Needham?s analysis is that she is treating the mkt as finite ie people will leave Netflix to go to Disney. But Disney and Apple did not get into this business to take customers from Netflix. They got in because they see a massive #$%$ in future years to streaming. So the point is all will win. The second flaw in Needham?s view is that she wants Netflix to introduce an ad model other wise they r in trouble. So now Laura from Needham wants to teach Reed Hastings the pioneer of streaming how to run his business when he does not see a problem.. just yesterday Sarantos at the UBS conference said business is intact. If he were losing subs he could easily do that. Short term because of these fears price can fall over next one year but don?t bank on it staying down.

3595,A couple years ago I bought some shares of NFLX at the $82 range and sold at the $92 range. I locked in a good $10/ share of gains and was very happy with my trade. Following my gains I saw the stock climb to $350 range. I was heartbroken and disappointed that I wasn't strong enough to hold on for the ride. However a couple years later ( Tuesday before the bell) I decided to participate and open a good position on NFLX. I'm very happy I did and I don't think a quick $10 - $20 bump up is enough to get out and lock in gains this time. Same thing happened to me with TSLA- I saw a $100 gain / per share and got out. Way too early now that I look back. After I got out of TSLA the stock rallied another $200+ a share.,0.9851

But I find it so entertaining to see how people can criticize a massive company’s finances from their basement desk about debts and “bad” financial strategies as if Netflix itself doesn’t have the intelligence to manage its company with such global presence and worth billions. This hit is not targeted to Netflix. And I’m sure in couple years the prices will recover and in 10 years you will retire with more money,0.376

Given high penetration in many developed market, Growth isn't great matrix but how many Subscriber left who might subscribe.Here is NFLX Subscriber peak analysis and it's scary.For No. purpose I am using 30% more household due to Common netflix account sharing. Which likely conservative.Current Subscriber count:- 125MWith Sharing About 165MTotal World house hold (Ex- China which clearly not going to launch anytime soon except licensing deal with limited extra income.):- 600M80% world population live on <$10/day, most of them can't even afford. Normally those household much bigger and so I assume 40% house hold can't afford Netflix like service more than month or two/year So Let's Reduce 35% house hold = 390 left.Now let's assume on average 50% of that 390 subscriber (Which actually mean 65%-70% penetration with sharing. This is very very high number because even USA they can't reach there and their marketing cost already balloon in USA just to keep current growth rate) = 185M.My prediction, Peak around 160-170M , after reach 150M, Growth will stall or even go negative. Growth likely slowdown in quarter or two as well.If price raised within 2 month, we might see 2-3 Quarter of growth Stall and peak reduce by 10% at least.If you are retail long, this is best time to take profit (Atleast some profit) peak is not far from here on growth. Normally stock react few month advance. So recent quick raise is due to expected growth near peak which almost always certain for popular services like Netflix, HBO ,DIS (HBO experience peak even in 2014 and so Disney on their current business Line).Only difference between HBO , DIS and Netflix is, unlike DIS and HBO who generate real profit, Netflix still spend $2B-$3B /year and add debt. Also not other businesses to balanced out.",0.996
3689,have you seen how much NFLX drops after it surges? Almost equally. Great to swing trade or if you are seriously long then we all know you got in wayyy before these price points. Point is I can't say it's a bad company but anyone buying in now or pretty much above 500s is taking huge risk IMHO. Then again a lot of the market is the same but NFLX surged way too high wayy too fast so it will correct before anything else does.

4089,"Netflix Inc.'s stock price target was cut to $458 from $463 by analyst David Miller at Imperial Capital, after the streaming video giant tapped the junk-bond market for the ninth time in six years. Meanwhile, Miller reiterated his bullish outperform rating, saying Netflix has a history of using the bond market effectively. The stock rose 0.9% in morning trade. Earlier this week, Netflix said it was offering $2 billion worth of U.S. and euro denominated debt, which Moody's rated at Ba3, which was three notches below the investment-grade rating threshold. As Miller said, the U.S. portion of the issuance will launch at 5.375% and the euro portion will launch at 3.875%, for a blended rate of 4.475%. In comparison, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.20% during the April 25 week. Miller said that Netflix has showed that tapping the debt markets has resulted in ""clear-cut, tangible, global subscriber growth and retention,"" as he assumes the proceeds from the latest debt issuance will go toward content acquisition, mostly on the self-produced side. The stock has climbed 18.4% over the past 12 months while the S&P 500 has gained 9.8%.",0.3175

Cash & equiv over the same timeframe only went from $2.1 bill to $3.8 bill. For year-ending 12/31/18, Netflix showed net inc of $2.68/sh diluted. The problem is that they're cash flow negative.

While the equity market is painting a rosy outlook for the internet entertainment and digital content company, the outlook from the rating agencies and bond market is less optimistic. Netflix's new ten-year debt carried a 5.875% coupon, a 291bp spread over Treasuries at issuance. The interest cost on Netflix's debt is roughly 2% higher than where high-quality, low-levered, A-rated companies issue debt in today's market.When we look at the companies in the high-yield corporate bond market (HYG, JNK) with the largest equity market caps, Netflix certainly stands out.

The company last night reported a ""nicely better than expected"" Q4 subscriber and financial results, conservative Q1 subscriber guidance and better than expected Q1 financial forecast, Wlodarczak tells investors in a research note. Further, management officially confirmed they no longer need outside capital to fund their business, and raised their 2021 free cash flow forecast to flat from negative $1B, adds the analyst.

Another article seemed to point to Google's Youtube, Apple streaming, Amazon, and others having had time to become a force of resistance. Add in the high debt and it seems to me the odds are NFLX has seen its high for quite some time. jmhoI like to back out and look at longer time periods. Seems to have a message. The 4 year chart has $130 for support. If it goes to the 313-315 range again (I forgot the low), it will be the third time, I'm thinking it breaks through to the downside then. 385 to 316 or so was a nice shortdoesn't mean it is necessarily even going down from here or bouncing and then going down. I just think it is likely. ................To me, they are losing money. Someone pointed out that they went more in debtt for new content, then they made in revenue. That's scrary, but they do have the potential to bring in revenue for years on the content. It seems to me they jumped in very heavily into massive debt trying to fend off the competition, before the competition made them irrelevant.You know one serious issue is that Apple and Amazon and maybe others are willing to basically give away their streaming service just to get the subscribers to help them sell product in their stores. That's a touch one for NFLX to work against. They have been quite creative though. Maybe they will bring on the education thing or something else. They could start selling things, compete agains Amazon and Apple, fight fire with fire. It's possible they could come up with some ingenious ideas to keep growing.I think they won't or it will be too little to late.

4689,"Why No One Can Catch NetflixBY MarketWatch— 6:44 PM ET 08/26/2018Knocking Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) is easy. Critics say the streaming company can't grow without big spending, making it impossible to turn a profit. But that assessment misses the key insight driving Netflix's ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) success, and why the stock is likely to climb again after last month's tumble.What Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) understands is that getting subscribers and, just as important, keeping them, is everything in the new media environment. The definition of success has shifted from how many eyeballs a channel can grab on a given night to how effectively a piece of content helps retain subscribers month after month. That insight has propelled Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) far ahead of Hulu and prompted the costly takeover battle between Comcast(CMCSA) and Walt Disney(DIS) for 21st Century Fox(FOXA) assets.It is also why Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) is sweeping up Hollywood talent. Earlier this month Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) wooed Kenya Barris, the creator of ""Black-ish,"" away from Disney, signing him to an exclusive, multiyear deal. Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) has also nabbed producers Ryan Murphyfrom 21st Century Fox (https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-signs-producer-ryan-murphy-to-multimillion-dollar- deal-1518588414) and Shonda Rhimesfrom Disney (https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-signs-scandal-creator-shonda-rhimes- away-from-abc-as-battle-for-talent-escalates-1502683261). It is expected to book $8 billion in expenses this year, though it will likely spend closer to $12 billion, according to Michael Morris, a media analyst at Guggenheim Securities. To some, those numbers seem excessive, but by spending to have the best content, Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) is locking in its subscribers and locking out its competitors.Netflix's ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) great advantage over its rivals is it doesn't need to show profits, as long as the subscriber numbers keep climbing. Profits can come at Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) when it has locked in enough subscribers who keep paying for content at higher prices.The major risk for Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) is that it somehow miscalculates what its subscribers want and doesn't draw in as many as expected. That happened last quarter (https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-reports-weaker-than-expected-number-of-new- subscribers-1531771717), when the stock tumbled 14%. But Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) has had many tumbles over the years, and strong growth has resumed. Thanks to its algorithm, Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) knows better than anyone else what kind of content it needs and when to launch it to keep subscribers happy.Disney's streaming services, set to launch next year, are the only possible threat to Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...). But Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) has a giant lead; it will take Disney years to catch up, in part because lots of Disney content is still licensed to Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...).Admittedly, the bar for Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) shares is higher now, and investors are nervous about whether it can keep growing at the same levels. But Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) has plenty of eyeballs still to sweep up--not only in international markets such as India and South America, but also at home, where cord-cutting continues apace.Netflix's ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) big lead may be its most important strength. It can keep bringing in talent, which will bring in new subscribers and keep existing ones happy. It will take a powerful competitor to break that cycle.",0.998

The stock value is about 80 times more than the revenue, we feel confident in that, price target higher than todays value.I wanna give you a tips. a streaming site, Mavshack, that has been active as long as the Netflix was active until 2011 had a stock value not even three times more then the revenue until a few days ago. In 2011 Netflix was worth as most 48 dollars, only a year later in 2012 it went down to $7, even though Netflix had 26 million subscribers, it was increasing in subscribers. Netflix was worth in its bottom only $7.00. Today 2020 Netflix is worth around $500. That means that Netflix increased its stock value with more than 7000% since its bottom in 2012. Mavshack have had a similar road until now as Netflix had its first 10 year on the market until 2012. Mavshack is increasing alot in the amount of subscribers. But the stock value have not shown its true value. The stock value has been very volatile and also has been on a down side for a long time. many investors been sceptical an pessimism have been around the stock for a while.But now its going to be a change, December 3rd 2020 it was announced that Mavshack will start Europe's largest shopping studio in collaboration with the NEP the world's leading technical production company for live productions and events. together with an EP marshak Salma has created the market's most elegant and cost effective VR studio. the market cap of Mavshack is only around 12 million American dollars. the stock is around its bottom. I can't see it getting much lower than it is now.. Now many feel like it's abiously that the stock is going to increase. With more good news about the streaming, live-sport coming up after realease of corona-restrictions and also the live shopping studio this stock can increase very rapidly and high in stock value. My own price target for this stock is around 400% for the upcoming year. I have been following this company for a long time and now I see a bright future for the company, its been an annoying ride until now. Please do your own anilyses and look this up. I feel very sure about that this stock is going to increase a lot upcoming years even though nothing in this world is totally sure. Maybe you would like to invest little in mavshack to get a big opportunity to get a big return out of it . I would still say Netflix is a more safe option but Mavshack is a great spice to it. Have a lot more potential to grow away higher in percentage. Have a pleasant day",0.9973

4814,"BTIG Rich Greenfield repeated his Buy recommendation on Netflix (ticker: NFLX) shares and lifted his price target to $630 from “a very stale” $375.Greenfield notes that he picked up coverage of the company in October 2019, when there were growing fears about competition from Disney+, Apple TV+,AT&T ’s HBO Max, and Comcast ’s Peacock. “Netflix not only shrugged off competition, the Covid-19 pandemic has pulled forward industry change, breaking the theatrical business just as Netflix’s theatrical investments are starting to bear fruit,” he writes in a post on the Lightshed website.Greenfield offers a list of six reasons to own Netflix shares:Unprecedented industry scale: He thinks the company will reach over 300 million subscribers by 2023 and over 400 million in 2026. Greenfield thinks that will translate to over $70 billion in revenue by 2026, with Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margins in the rante of 35% to 40%.Accelerating cord-cutting: Greenfield says that while the addition of new streaming services has not hurt Netflix, it has dinged the cable and satellite TV businesses. “Outside of sports, legacy media companies are essentially telling consumers that there is no reason to subscribe to multichannel television anymore,” he writes. “It’s over. Multichannel video subscriber declines rose from low-single digits in early 2019 to mid-single digits by late 2019 and will end 2020 in the high-single digits.”Covid has accelerated industry transformation: “With so little fresh content on TV and without sports for several months, consumer adoption of streaming hit warp speed. Once consumer behavior shifts, it is very hard to shift it back, especially when the “experience” of streaming TV is so far superior to linear live TV,” he writes.Studios unwilling to shift film economic models: Most major studios are unwilling to shift to a streaming-first model, he notes. And Greenfield finds that puzzling. He notes that Walt Disney (DIS) had a huge hit streaming Hamilton, but the pay-per-view model adopted for Mulan has been a “financial failure.” That miss, along with the weak reception for the theatrical release of the Christopher Nolan film Tenet, has major studios delaying major releases until summer 2021 or later, while shifting smaller budget films to streaming services. In contrast, he points out that Netflix has a hit in the newly released film Enola Holmes, and has 18 or more movies lined up for October release. Greenfield writes: “As consumers begin to appreciate the steady stream of high quality films on Netflix at no additional cost, it makes Hollywood’s [pay per view] ambitions even harder to achieve and it likely means that theatrical attendance will never rebound to prior levels whenever the pandemic is behind us. The longer Hollywood studios remain focused on the sequential release pattern for movies that starts with theatrical, the more it advantages Netflix.”Competition lacks global ambition: “When we look at the major streaming competition, we see limited interest in having global subscriber scale, let alone producing local content all around the world that can be utilized by all subscribers,” he writes. “Netflix’s global content scale increasingly feels like even larger strategic advantage than its domestic programming spending.”Feature animation at Disney scale: “Netflix has been investing aggressively in animation for the past couple of years, but the animated feature lead time means the output is just beginning ...The first Netflix animated feature film that feels Disney-like is Over the Moon, which will be released next month ...It remains far too early to judge Netflix’s animation strength, but in success it could meaningfully increase the value perception of a Netflix subscription and make it even harder for families to cancel their subscriptions.”",0.9895

While Q2 expectations have ""run up significantly ahead of already high guidance,"" the key driver is likely to be Q3 guidance where expectations are ""relatively subdued"" due to company commentary earlier in the year and a tough comp versus Stranger Things last year, Venkateshwar tells investors in a pre-earnings research note.

The current P/E ratio is still way too high by all means. I have never said that NFLX doesn't have a good product, it just that the market cap is twice as to what it should be. They have grown by given its product at prices that doesn't sustain their business bottom line. When they increase the price to become profitable the customer base will decrease. So they are in a very tough position. In addition, competition by Disney, Apple, Google and others will only intensified down the road. If you still have profits sell and run for the hills and if you have losses sell now to minimize further loses.

In order to realize its heady targets, NFLX must penetrate and be the top one or two streaming services in a large percentage of countries.

So he is using the dynamic duo (Obama/Rice) to assuage the world and ensure NFLX can succeed in these countries.The fact that NFLX would be willing to take the risk of angering 1/2 of the USA in order to build int'l bridges for NFLX tells me that Hastings and co. are desperate for the subscriber growth that will only happen if the world embraces NFLX. This is not a good sign.So, my thoughts have evolved on this. Sure, Hastings is a Lib, has a vehicle for spreading the message, and can use the dynamic duo to do so.

The growing popularity of subscription services, particularly across media, has been key to these names’ success.“They are essentially trading on the fact that they are growing their subscriptions. It really doesn’t matter how profitable they are; it almost doesn’t even matter how much revenue they have. It’s the subscription growth that really attracts them, because then it makes them a candidate for M&A for, probably, old media,” he said Thursday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.”“Until and unless their subscription growth rate slows down, I think it’s very dangerous to short them at this point. That’s the dynamic that’s really driving them, and that’s the dynamic that could push them even higher as we go from this point,” he added.https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/06/streaming-stocks-are-on-a-tear-and-its-not-just-netflix.html?__source=yahoo%7Cfinance%7Cheadline%7Cstory%7C&par=yahoo&yptr=yahoo",0.9667

Increased competition may not take subscribers away from NFLX, but it will make it harder to raise subscription prices, and it commits NFLX to massive debt funded content spending.

5025,"Why Netflix could surprise to the upsideThere are number of reasons why Netflix could deliver better-than-expected results next Tuesday. The COVID-19 pandemic was a key driver of the surge in the first half of the year when it added 25.9 million subscribers. In October, when the company offered that guidance, the pandemic was much more controlled than it is today. In the U.S., daily new cases went from about 60,000 to more than 200,000 today, while new infections similarly spiked in Europe, prompting lockdowns in countries like France and the U.K., as well as incremental measures in parts of the U.S., like Southern California and New York.That rise in cases is likely to have driven similar growth in subscriptions the way the initial outbreak in the spring did.The company also said it would�raise prices�in the U.S. at the end of October from $12.99/month to $13.99/month on its most popular membership option. While that move was widely expected, it shows management's confidence in both its long-term growth trajectory and the performance in the fourth quarter. A 2019 price increase caused Netflix to report a slight decline in subscribers in the second quarter, but that was during a seasonally slow quarter. Also, it was a larger price hike, as prices went up by $2 then compared to just a $1 hike last year. It also proved to be a temporary speed bump as it returned to steady growth in the following quarter.Additionally, there's evidence of a streaming boom across the industry in the fourth quarter.�Disney�reported that it added 13 million subscribers in the two months leading up to the beginning of December, while streaming aggregator�Reelgood�noted ""massive growth across the board,"" though it did say Netflix's leading market share declined from 25% to 22% among Reelgood's 2 million users.Finally, Netflix rolled out another strong slate of content in Q4.�The Queen's Gambit�was a surprise hit globally, sparking a surge in chess interest around the world, and the company also seems to have scored victories with the first season of�Emily in Paris, which was already renewed for its second season, and Season 4 of�The Crown, one of its strongest franchises. Towards the end of the quarter on Dec. 25, the company also released the first season of�Bridgerton, Shonda Rhimes' first production for the service, which has also received critical acclaim.Data from Reelgood shows that five of the top 10 streaming movies in the fourth quarter were released on Netflix, including�The Haunting,�Hubie Halloween,�Mank,�The Trial of The Chicago 7, and#$%$ Elegy.",0.9966

5138,"How can Netflix stay up at least 180 points too high? Read the details, Hbo all series are quality, this is a game changer, they are trend setters!In year one, there will be 31 original series on HBO Max, growing to 50 series in 2021 (in addition to originals for legacy HBO), according to Kevin Reilly, chief content officer, HBO Max and president, TBS, TNT, and truTV. Underscoring HBO Max’s focus on “content that matters to viewers,” Reilly said the top 100 titles on streaming services drive half the total usage. Translation: HBO Max is focused on quality, not raw tonnage of content.As previously announced, HBO Max is getting its hands on the entire runs of “Friends,”“The Big Bang Theory,” “The West Wing” and “Pretty Little Liars,” among others; the entire Studio Ghibli film catalog; the full library of “Sesame Street” as well as the next five seasons; and CW dramas produced by Warner Bros. starting with the fall 2019 season (30 days prior to the TV premiere of the next seasons of the shows).HBO Max will have 1,800 movies at launch. In the first year, the film selection will include all the films in “The Matrix,” “The Hobbit” and “The Lord of the Rings” franchises as well as all titles in the last 10 years from DC Entertainment, including every Superman and Batman movie ever made. Recently released hit “Joker” starring Joaquin Phoenix will be available at launch.After the initial U.S. launch, AT&T will take HBO Max international — in 2021, it plans to debut localized versions of HBO Max in Latin America and Europe, according to Stankey.AT&T told investors Monday that it expects to spend $1.5 billion to $2 billion on HBO Max next year and invest a billion in each of the following two years, before hitting profitability in 2025.In 2021, WarnerMedia expects HBO Max to generate $1 billion in incremental revenue from the U.S. — over and above HBO — stepping up by a billion each year through 2025 to $5 billion. Those forecasts include ad revenue, expected to come in starting in 2021.It’s unclear how the so-called streaming wars will shake out, but Netflix investors in particular have been unnerved at the prospect of competition with content powerhouses like WarnerMedia, Disney and NBCUniversal. Some analysts believe it’s not a zero-sum game, with room for several big streamers to gain traction — likely at the expense of pay television.",0.9683

Now we are at 400 all time high and 500 is new target. Price will dump at least 10% BEFORE going higher...350-360 range will hit again soon. Don't read the hype on this stock...its being swing traded by big-cap on and off wall street. So, NFLX will dump soon BEFORE GOING MUCH HIGHER then 400...watch an learn....we swing traders make way more in long-run. We lock in profits on each run. Mostly we go LONG till new highs break, take profits, then capitalize on pullbacks with shorts... then hop right back in LONG at lower levels. PLUS, we dont risk losing large portions of our gains if something really bad happens. Much safer to swing trade...just need a good coach and trading group.",0.9675

Keeps neutral rating.Goldman Sachs (Heath Terry)“Netflix has outperformed the best-fit-line in each of the last four quarters suggesting that the company is getting incremental leverage on its content investments.”Because subscriber additions continue to exceed expectations and the company is approaching “an inflection point in cash profitability, we believe shares of NFLX will continue to significantly outperform.”Raises price target to $450 from $420 “to reflect faster subscriber growth, particularly in international markets.” The firm maintained its buy rating and kept Netflix on its conviction list.RBC Capital Markets (Mark Mahaney)Global paid subscriber growth continues to accelerate, and the “pulling of pricing lever should be successful,” which “means accelerating revenue growth & operating margin expansion.”Raises price target to $480 from $450, not far below the Street-high target of $500.

Now, let me give you an anology. If you have a starting five such as the golden state warriors and for years you are close to making the playoffs but then you lose in the first round if you do make it. Now, you trade some players or aquire all stars such as adding super all star Kevin Durant. You win the championship. Now, going back to Netflix is that they are not staying competitive and when Walmart which is way bigger than netflix will ever be starting their streaming service or how google is buying up the Virtual Reality sector you will see why Netflix will not compete.

5484,"Let me tell you all something. NFLX is a good company. you want to buy it by all mean buy it. by the next year this time, it could be $600 a share or could be $100 a share. A company that gains or losses 30 billion $ in market cap in one week, is not an investment, is more of a gambling. Up until now, not much competitions for Netflix, but other companies now getting more serious or increase their exposures in this area, such as Amazon, Apple, Disney, AT&T, Hulu. With the current evaluations that Netflix has, it better be no competitions around. There is no room for errors. Don't just think because it dropped from $400+ to $360, now is a burgain. Once the trend breaks, the down fall is fast and furious",-0.1548
