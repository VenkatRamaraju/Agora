Only 20% or 87 million shares worth 36 billion are owned by individuals (source: NASDAQ). These institutions usually rebalance their portfolio every June. So June has passed. These institutions are not prone to sell-off. For example with the GE stock; Vanguard maintains to own 600 million shares of GE, and BlackRock maintains to own 500 million shares of GE even GE fell from $26 to $13. Why they did not sell them. There was no SEC records that Vanguard or BlackRock bought or sold GE stocks. So will these institutions be triggered for a NFLX sell-off thus spiralling the NFLX price to half? It's a possibility but the chances of not happening is greater. In May 2002, NFLX = $1.21 and it has survived the Great Recession and reached this far to $418.

187,Yesterday CNBC focussed on Needham?s downgrade. There are all kinds of views but what I find disingenuous is that cnbc only published the negative one. There are four other updates from analyst. Bernstein at 422 yesterday. JP Morgan at 425 yesterday and stifel at 400 day before. piper jaffray today at 400. No mention of those at all. It also falls pre mkt because a network knows CNBc is going to focus on the negative one and starts shorting. Easy money. The flaw in Needham?s analysis is that she is treating the mkt as finite ie people will leave Netflix to go to Disney. But Disney and Apple did not get into this business to take customers from Netflix. They got in because they see a massive #$%$ in future years to streaming. So the point is all will win. The second flaw in Needham?s view is that she wants Netflix to introduce an ad model other wise they r in trouble. So now Laura from Needham wants to teach Reed Hastings the pioneer of streaming how to run his business when he does not see a problem.. just yesterday Sarantos at the UBS conference said business is intact. If he were losing subs he could easily do that. Short term because of these fears price can fall over next one year but don?t bank on it staying down. Too big a mkt and the suggestion they Netflix will lose 4 mn subs is complete nonsense with the pipeline of programmes.,0.9822

For year-ending 12/31/18, Netflix showed net inc of $2.68/sh diluted. The problem is that they're cash flow negative.

So, NFLX will dump soon BEFORE GOING MUCH HIGHER then 400...watch an learn....we swing traders make way more in long-run. We lock in profits on each run.

(VIAC), VIACA, NFLX, VIA, VIAB, Includes: AAPL, AMZN, BRK.A, BRK.B, DIS, FB, GOOG, GOOGL, TJune 2. 2020Paul Franke Paul FrankeContrarian, long/short equity, momentum, Deep Value(6,000 followers)SummaryThe Netflix business model is under competitive attack and risks becoming the next America Online boom/bust example of a changing technology landscape.Without free cash flow and a much larger library of media content, Netflix cannot win the coming streaming wars.Only a bold and masterful move by management to acquire a company like ViacomCBS will keep the Netflix stock quote around present levels.The Viacom-CBS business combination is almost complete and could be a long-term buy regardless of any Netflix moves.Netflix (NFLX) is in big trouble without a grand stroke of genius by management in coming months. I propose the company fix its two biggest competitive problems - the lack of both owned content and free cash generation - before it’s too late. Netflix’s middleman streaming business model between customers and media content assets will not cut it anymore. By acquiring the new ViacomCBS combined media enterprise as soon as possible, Netflix can turn lemons into lemonade. Purchasing a huge library of entertainment assets to broadcast over the internet, while immediately adding $3-5 billion in cash flow and earnings generation each year, would put the embattled Netflix stock quote back on track.Management at Netflix is rapidly coming to realize a stand-pat operating model of paying billions annually to create/rent streaming content, while its high subscription selling price per month is coming under attack by new competition, is a lose-lose proposition going into 2020. The only way forward is to make a bold move, specifically a transformative merger with an important media content owner.Sumner Redstone and his National Amusement entity hold about 79% voting control of the soon-to-be-merged CBS Corporation (CBS, CBS.A) and Viacom Inc. (VIAB, VIA). I think an all-stock Netflix deal to buy out ViacomCBS in late 2019 or early 2020 would be an ideal ending statement for his long career in entertainment ownership and production. Who wouldn’t want to become one of the largest shareholders in a reinvigorated, high-growth return Netflix? After subpar investment gains from his companies for several decades versus the media industry, a sellout to Netflix may prove to be his grandest and smartest achievement. Sometimes, the simplest answer is the best answer. Netflix’s board and management only have to negotiate with the Redstone family to work out a price.Below are graphs of some of the television/film content ViacomCBS owns.Source: CBS and Viacom Investor SlideshowDuring 2016, I outlined the argument on Seeking Alpha for Disney (DIS) to acquire Netflix when its quote was around $120 a share. The merger would have allowed Disney to quickly enter and basically control the world of streaming video/entertainment content all over the world. Apparently, Disney’s CEO, Bob Iger, did not like the steep entry fee back then, around $50 billion to buy out the premier global streaming company. Of course, feeling left behind a few years later, Mr. Iger decided to purchase $70 billion in Fox content assets, and will likely spend tens of billions more building out Disney’s streaming service about to begin in November.Now the big boys are all coming to play in Netflix’s backyard. Everyone is entering the streaming business and spending billions to become even bigger players. Disney+, Google’s Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and YouTube, Apple (AAPL) TV, Amazon (AMZN) Prime, Facebook (FB) and AT&T (T) Time Warner have all announced media content investments or new spending sprees in the tens of billions to roll out greater streaming options for consumers globally. The competitive environment for Netflix could easily turn it into the America Online situation of the 1990s tech bubble peak. Basically, AOL grew at an astounding clip to become the largest and only truly functioning Microsoft Windows (MSFT)-compatible online access company for U.S. consumers between 1993 and 1999. Then, competition and a changing Internet access landscape showed up and ran AOL into the ground. Could Netflix suffer the same fate? I have openly wondered about Netflix’s business fortunes past 2019, and have been short the stock off and on this year.Netflix is Expensive, ViacomCBS is CheapThe argument for an all-stock deal, where Netflix just mints new shares to hand out to Sumner (and a few others) for ownership of ViacomCBS, is compelling right now. CBS and Viacom are late to the game in streaming, planning to spend future cash flow and earnings to catch up. Why not join forces with the world’s largest streaming service, filling your business model void overnight, while helping Netflix to plug its major gaps? Talk about a win-w",0.9988

Investors dont worry, just hold...but swing traders, wait for 228 to break (or come close, below 330) before getting back in this beast. Now, if NFLX does NOT go back down, then we will just wait for higher resistance swing levels, and start our shorts again for quick 5-10 pullbacks. Again, we DO NOT guess direction, we instead wait patiently on sidelines till price comes to us. Way less stress and we ALWAYS get a damn good entry with this strategy. But there is far more to Day Trader Josh's strategy then what I just mapped out here. But at least you get the framework.

I figured Netflix would start losing US subscribers, but I didn't think it would happen immediately.And after a disastrous quarter, the CEO blames analysts for bad projections? So it is good to be losing US subscribers? Face it, the CEO is doing absolutely everything wrong. He wanted to be the new cable tv and a one-stop shop for everyone. People don't want that?

In order to realize its heady targets, NFLX must penetrate and be the top one or two streaming services in a large percentage of countries. IMO, Hastings apparently feels Trump damages American prestige, and in turn, NFLX prospects. So he is using the dynamic duo (Obama/Rice) to assuage the world and ensure NFLX can succeed in these countries.The fact that NFLX would be willing to take the risk of angering 1/2 of the USA in order to build int'l bridges for NFLX tells me that Hastings and co. are desperate for the subscriber growth that will only happen if the world embraces NFLX. This is not a good sign.So, my thoughts have evolved on this. Sure, Hastings is a Lib, has a vehicle for spreading the message, and can use the dynamic duo to do so.

While reduce them from quality companies.

I get that they are spending boatloads to create content which is amounting to significant cash burn resulting in negative CFO. Seems as though management is confident this is necessary to keep subscribers growing and will lay the groundwork for a strong stream of income into the future. That sounds great if it works out but this almost seems to good to be true. Questions that come to mind are: how long will it take to be cash flow positive, especially with the burn rate increasing rather than decreasing? What if popular shows fall out of favor in the distant future, get pirated, or too many new shows flop? What about competition? This just seems to me like a very aggressive strategy and that no matter how many subscribers they can get, the ultimate sustainability of the business will depend on being able to generate cash flow which can only mean higher prices which will attract more competition at some point. This reminds me a little bit of the flaws of Pandora’s model in a way where they had to spend more and more on royalties to keep up with subscriber growth.

Ive seen that a lot of times. The effect isn't here yet, they are still messing with it. They can use it to kill shorts, the hedge funds I mean.But eventually, and obviously, the cost comes to NFLX that is already heavily debt burdened.

In a survey of over 1,500 U.S. consumers, 57% of respondents said they used Netflix (NFLX.NaE), up from 55% in May 2018 and 53% in September 2017. The survey also showed that 68% of Netflix (NFLX.NaE) subscribers were ""extremely"" or ""very satisfied"" with their experience. A hefty 84% percent of subscribers said they were ""not at all likely"" or ""slightly likely"" to cancel in the next three months, though that figure was below the 87% average of the last five quarters. In the U.K., 56% of respondents said they used Netflix (NFLX.NaE), up from 49% last year. Eight percent of subscribers in the U.K. said they were ""extremely"" or ""very"" satisfied with the service, and churn levels in the U.K. were at a record low; a record 71% said they were ""not at all"" or ""slightly likely"" to cancel in the next 3 months. ""We believe that Netflix (NFLX.NaE) has achieved a level of sustainable scale, growth, and profitability that isn't currently reflected in its stock price,"" wrote RBC analysts, led by Mark Mahaney, in a note to investors. He said he also sees potential in Netflix's (NFLX.NaE) push into India. ""India could well be a source of millions of new Netflix (NFLX.NaE) subscribers over the next few years,"" he wrote, ""but the company has a lot of work to do."" An RBC review of local Indian news sources suggested Netflix (NFLX.NaE) was off to a good start; its original series ""Sacred Games"" has become highly popular in the region.

Look for Netflix google trends, traffic analysis, and mobile app ranking overtake. In conclusion, I found that October wasn?t a smacking hot month for unique visitors. November got better. I will pause here and let you know that story changes from here. December was Netflix?s best traffic month ever in history thanks to the holidays and yes i have to give credit to bird box and bundersnatch for making that happen. Few days back a moron analyst price cut netflix from SunTrust who said it will miss. Now yes, October and November wasn?t as hot as i hoped it would be but the dude based his full conclusion from google trends. Thats the biggest mistake he made as there is a lot that google trends misses and did I point out he didn?t check December #$%$! He should be fired in my opinion or at least investigated. His words can have an impact as we live in an age of computers trading and crowd following traders we saw a 4% drop that day but later closed neutral. Google trends does not know how many people are visiting netflix domain without a G search secondly if you log in from an app it wont be able to catch that. So I also checked traffic analysis for the domain as well as app downloads. October and November again showed decent progress but nothing out of the ordinary as 9.4 million subscribers is a huge ask. Which i was worried at first but after December we might actually make it and it still could fall short.

2046,"Netflix Inc.'s stock price target was cut to $458 from $463 by analyst David Miller at Imperial Capital, after the streaming video giant tapped the junk-bond market for the ninth time in six years. Meanwhile, Miller reiterated his bullish outperform rating, saying Netflix has a history of using the bond market effectively. The stock rose 0.9% in morning trade. Earlier this week, Netflix said it was offering $2 billion worth of U.S. and euro denominated debt, which Moody's rated at Ba3, which was three notches below the investment-grade rating threshold. As Miller said, the U.S. portion of the issuance will launch at 5.375% and the euro portion will launch at 3.875%, for a blended rate of 4.475%. In comparison, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.20% during the April 25 week. Miller said that Netflix has showed that tapping the debt markets has resulted in ""clear-cut, tangible, global subscriber growth and retention,"" as he assumes the proceeds from the latest debt issuance will go toward content acquisition, mostly on the self-produced side. The stock has climbed 18.4% over the past 12 months while the S&P 500 has gained 9.8%.",0.3175

2280,"Being a customer of NFLX, I think there is room to add other streaming service as long as the monthly total budget is less than $20. You paid a lot for cable shows in the old days. I cancelled my cable (50+ Mbps) and switch to AT&T fiber (300 Mbps), about half the price and 6x the speed. It's no brainer. So cable companies are in trouble since they used to be the only ones in my area gave you decent internet connection speed. I subscribed to cable for internet only and the cable shows I rarely watched and not subscribed with the bundle do not save much. With the saving, I'll add DIS+ to my streaming service. I believe the package is about $6.99 per month. I'll try out for one year and if I find value in them, I'll keep both. If I don't have time, I'll just keep one. So if most people think like me, then NFLX subscribers loss will be capped somewhat. Their dangers lie in adding new subscribers and future pricing increase. People new to streaming service will likely pick a cheaper package with good contents and DIS will win in this space. NFLX will have difficulty to further increase price to offset its production cost. They will be under more pressure to give up shows that don't immediately perform instead allow them time to play out more. Based on above thesis, I will not touch NFLX until one or two quarters into DIS+ have been turned on. In this market no need to take extra risks when you see it coming.",0.978

It seemingly delivered, creating a consistent stream of interest and buzz around original titles,” Maria wrote.You can count the roaring success of Tiger King, crime drama Ozark, dating reality series Too Hot to Handle, and Michael Jordan docuseries the Last Dance among the titles which have kept sofa bound consumers tuned into Netflix. Add to that children content which got a meaningful boost during schools’ closures and a sizeable library of reality TV shows and docuseries, “with the two genres representing over 20% of the top 10 most popular TV series during Q2,” and you get Ripps’ point. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-original-content-library-separates-005355727.html",0.9831

2432,"Why Netflix could surprise to the upsideThere are number of reasons why Netflix could deliver better-than-expected results next Tuesday. The COVID-19 pandemic was a key driver of the surge in the first half of the year when it added 25.9 million subscribers. In October, when the company offered that guidance, the pandemic was much more controlled than it is today. In the U.S., daily new cases went from about 60,000 to more than 200,000 today, while new infections similarly spiked in Europe, prompting lockdowns in countries like France and the U.K., as well as incremental measures in parts of the U.S., like Southern California and New York.That rise in cases is likely to have driven similar growth in subscriptions the way the initial outbreak in the spring did.The company also said it would�raise prices�in the U.S. at the end of October from $12.99/month to $13.99/month on its most popular membership option. While that move was widely expected, it shows management's confidence in both its long-term growth trajectory and the performance in the fourth quarter. A 2019 price increase caused Netflix to report a slight decline in subscribers in the second quarter, but that was during a seasonally slow quarter. Also, it was a larger price hike, as prices went up by $2 then compared to just a $1 hike last year. It also proved to be a temporary speed bump as it returned to steady growth in the following quarter.Additionally, there's evidence of a streaming boom across the industry in the fourth quarter.�Disney�reported that it added 13 million subscribers in the two months leading up to the beginning of December, while streaming aggregator�Reelgood�noted ""massive growth across the board,"" though it did say Netflix's leading market share declined from 25% to 22% among Reelgood's 2 million users.Finally, Netflix rolled out another strong slate of content in Q4.�The Queen's Gambit�was a surprise hit globally, sparking a surge in chess interest around the world, and the company also seems to have scored victories with the first season of�Emily in Paris, which was already renewed for its second season, and Season 4 of�The Crown, one of its strongest franchises. Towards the end of the quarter on Dec. 25, the company also released the first season of�Bridgerton, Shonda Rhimes' first production for the service, which has also received critical acclaim.Data from Reelgood shows that five of the top 10 streaming movies in the fourth quarter were released on Netflix, including�The Haunting,�Hubie Halloween,�Mank,�The Trial of The Chicago 7, and#$%$ Elegy.",0.9966

2854,"NFLX is a great idea and a great company. It is just that it's stock price has become bloated. This is just a modern version of a cable network (TW or Comcast but does not own the pipe to your home so can't sell other services), so it is more like a broadcasting company ABC or NBC with less content, albeit perhaps more entertaining. So how does it garner a market cap equal to 75% of Disney's who's content rakes (as well as other streams of revenue) 5 times the top line revenue of NFLX and 6 times NFLX earnings.

2914,"People investing based on wrong matrix called Growth. Given high penetration in many developed market, Growth isn't great matrix but how many Subscriber left who might subscribe.Here is NFLX Subscriber peak analysis and it's scary.For No. purpose I am using 30% more household due to Common netflix account sharing. Which likely conservative.Current Subscriber count:- 125MWith Sharing About 165MTotal World house hold (Ex- China which clearly not going to launch anytime soon except licensing deal with limited extra income.):- 600M80% world population live on <$10/day, most of them can't even afford. Normally those household much bigger and so I assume 40% house hold can't afford Netflix like service more than month or two/year So Let's Reduce 35% house hold = 390 left.Now let's assume on average 50% of that 390 subscriber (Which actually mean 65%-70% penetration with sharing. This is very very high number because even USA they can't reach there and their marketing cost already balloon in USA just to keep current growth rate) = 185M.My prediction, Peak around 160-170M , after reach 150M, Growth will stall or even go negative. Growth likely slowdown in quarter or two as well.If price raised within 2 month, we might see 2-3 Quarter of growth Stall and peak reduce by 10% at least.If you are retail long, this is best time to take profit (Atleast some profit) peak is not far from here on growth. Normally stock react few month advance. So recent quick raise is due to expected growth near peak which almost always certain for popular services like Netflix, HBO ,DIS (HBO experience peak even in 2014 and so Disney on their current business Line).Only difference between HBO , DIS and Netflix is, unlike DIS and HBO who generate real profit, Netflix still spend $2B-$3B /year and add debt.

The computer services company is credited with developing JavaScript and had an incredibly rewarding IPO as its stock soared from $28 to more than $75 on the first day of trading. At its peak, Netscape Navigator's market share was over 90-percent. November 24, 1998 would prove to be the turning point in the company's history as AOL announced it would acquire Netscape for over $4 billion.

3505,"BTIG Rich Greenfield repeated his Buy recommendation on Netflix (ticker: NFLX) shares and lifted his price target to $630 from “a very stale” $375.Greenfield notes that he picked up coverage of the company in October 2019, when there were growing fears about competition from Disney+, Apple TV+,AT&T ’s HBO Max, and Comcast ’s Peacock. “Netflix not only shrugged off competition, the Covid-19 pandemic has pulled forward industry change, breaking the theatrical business just as Netflix’s theatrical investments are starting to bear fruit,” he writes in a post on the Lightshed website.Greenfield offers a list of six reasons to own Netflix shares:Unprecedented industry scale: He thinks the company will reach over 300 million subscribers by 2023 and over 400 million in 2026. Greenfield thinks that will translate to over $70 billion in revenue by 2026, with Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margins in the rante of 35% to 40%.Accelerating cord-cutting: Greenfield says that while the addition of new streaming services has not hurt Netflix, it has dinged the cable and satellite TV businesses. “Outside of sports, legacy media companies are essentially telling consumers that there is no reason to subscribe to multichannel television anymore,” he writes. “It’s over. Multichannel video subscriber declines rose from low-single digits in early 2019 to mid-single digits by late 2019 and will end 2020 in the high-single digits.”Covid has accelerated industry transformation: “With so little fresh content on TV and without sports for several months, consumer adoption of streaming hit warp speed. Once consumer behavior shifts, it is very hard to shift it back, especially when the “experience” of streaming TV is so far superior to linear live TV,” he writes.Studios unwilling to shift film economic models: Most major studios are unwilling to shift to a streaming-first model, he notes. And Greenfield finds that puzzling. He notes that Walt Disney (DIS) had a huge hit streaming Hamilton, but the pay-per-view model adopted for Mulan has been a “financial failure.” That miss, along with the weak reception for the theatrical release of the Christopher Nolan film Tenet, has major studios delaying major releases until summer 2021 or later, while shifting smaller budget films to streaming services. In contrast, he points out that Netflix has a hit in the newly released film Enola Holmes, and has 18 or more movies lined up for October release. Greenfield writes: “As consumers begin to appreciate the steady stream of high quality films on Netflix at no additional cost, it makes Hollywood’s [pay per view] ambitions even harder to achieve and it likely means that theatrical attendance will never rebound to prior levels whenever the pandemic is behind us. The longer Hollywood studios remain focused on the sequential release pattern for movies that starts with theatrical, the more it advantages Netflix.”Competition lacks global ambition: “When we look at the major streaming competition, we see limited interest in having global subscriber scale, let alone producing local content all around the world that can be utilized by all subscribers,” he writes. “Netflix’s global content scale increasingly feels like even larger strategic advantage than its domestic programming spending.”Feature animation at Disney scale: “Netflix has been investing aggressively in animation for the past couple of years, but the animated feature lead time means the output is just beginning ...The first Netflix animated feature film that feels Disney-like is Over the Moon, which will be released next month ...It remains far too early to judge Netflix’s animation strength, but in success it could meaningfully increase the value perception of a Netflix subscription and make it even harder for families to cancel their subscriptions.”",0.9895

Read the details, Hbo all series are quality, this is a game changer, they are trend setters!In year one, there will be 31 original series on HBO Max, growing to 50 series in 2021 (in addition to originals for legacy HBO), according to Kevin Reilly, chief content officer, HBO Max and president, TBS, TNT, and truTV. Underscoring HBO Max’s focus on “content that matters to viewers,” Reilly said the top 100 titles on streaming services drive half the total usage. Translation: HBO Max is focused on quality, not raw tonnage of content.As previously announced, HBO Max is getting its hands on the entire runs of “Friends,”“The Big Bang Theory,” “The West Wing” and “Pretty Little Liars,” among others; the entire Studio Ghibli film catalog; the full library of “Sesame Street” as well as the next five seasons; and CW dramas produced by Warner Bros. starting with the fall 2019 season (30 days prior to the TV premiere of the next seasons of the shows).HBO Max will have 1,800 movies at launch. In the first year, the film selection will include all the films in “The Matrix,” “The Hobbit” and “The Lord of the Rings” franchises as well as all titles in the last 10 years from DC Entertainment, including every Superman and Batman movie ever made. Recently released hit “Joker” starring Joaquin Phoenix will be available at launch.After the initial U.S. launch, AT&T will take HBO Max international — in 2021, it plans to debut localized versions of HBO Max in Latin America and Europe, according to Stankey.AT&T told investors Monday that it expects to spend $1.5 billion to $2 billion on HBO Max next year and invest a billion in each of the following two years, before hitting profitability in 2025.In 2021, WarnerMedia expects HBO Max to generate $1 billion in incremental revenue from the U.S. — over and above HBO — stepping up by a billion each year through 2025 to $5 billion. Those forecasts include ad revenue, expected to come in starting in 2021.It’s unclear how the so-called streaming wars will shake out, but Netflix investors in particular have been unnerved at the prospect of competition with content powerhouses like WarnerMedia, Disney and NBCUniversal. Some analysts believe it’s not a zero-sum game, with room for several big streamers to gain traction — likely at the expense of pay television.",0.9683

Even higher than Q4 last year. 2.> Revenue per subscriber raise is lower when you compare history and recent price hike. Without hike it was going 1.5%-2% up as people subscriber higher quality plans. With Raise last Quarter with most not raised until near end of year, it's up only 4.8%.3.> Content spend is getting crazy. I think If they hit unexpected peak for subscriber, Those content cost very hard to pay for.

Internet TV is here to stay and the growth runway is massive. Within that, they wrote, Netflix (NFLX) has a huge head start.""The platform has reached near ubiquity with the help of an effective original content strategy, and a global mass market has emerged with streaming becoming the consumer's preferred way to consume video content,"" Jayant and DiClemente wrote",0.9862

Another article seemed to point to Google's Youtube, Apple streaming, Amazon, and others having had time to become a force of resistance. Add in the high debt and it seems to me the odds are NFLX has seen its high for quite some time. jmhoI like to back out and look at longer time periods. Seems to have a message. The 4 year chart has $130 for support. If it goes to the 313-315 range again (I forgot the low), it will be the third time, I'm thinking it breaks through to the downside then. 385 to 316 or so was a nice shortdoesn't mean it is necessarily even going down from here or bouncing and then going down. I just think it is likely. ................To me, they are losing money. Someone pointed out that they went more in debtt for new content, then they made in revenue. That's scrary, but they do have the potential to bring in revenue for years on the content. It seems to me they jumped in very heavily into massive debt trying to fend off the competition, before the competition made them irrelevant.You know one serious issue is that Apple and Amazon and maybe others are willing to basically give away their streaming service just to get the subscribers to help them sell product in their stores. That's a touch one for NFLX to work against. They have been quite creative though. Maybe they will bring on the education thing or something else. They could start selling things, compete agains Amazon and Apple, fight fire with fire. It's possible they could come up with some ingenious ideas to keep growing.I think they won't or it will be too little to late.

3978,"Netflix is maybe worth $30 right now... Everyone living in this imaginary land where Netflix can keep growing as much as they want. Fact is they need cash to operate and grow which they don't have, last year before financing Netflix cash flow was negative 2 billion dollars, just losing more and more every year. Bonds funding this debt start maturing 2021, price of them is already dropping. Who would buy 10 year junk bonds from Netflix at 5.5% when 10 year treasury notes could be yielding 4% next year?They are going to have to up yield of the bonds they issue in hopes someone will buy them. But if they up the yield of the bonds it means they need to increase their profit margin which is already way below the rate they are paying on current bonds. They can't afford more expensive debt. Its irrelevant how many more subscribers they get or how great the shows are unless they start getting positive cash flow very soon.Fact is Netflix future is in their creditors hands, Netflix has no control. Why invest in a company that can't control its own destiny when there are positive cash flow growth companies like AMZN, GOOG or FB? Makes no sense to invest in Netflix when you have much better options out there. So many places to get just as much upside without the huge risk Netflix has. Maybe they pull a rabbit filled with cash out of their hat and make the business work but they can pop at any moment and then everything is gone...If you want to invest in hype just invest in Bitcoin more upside with less risk as Bitcoin doesn't have creditors lol.",0.9567

Now, I have been researching this sector for years and I am a subscriber to Netflix but I don't use it. Now the reason why will shock you? They have the same shows on their since I started service. Now, let me give you an anology. If you have a starting five such as the golden state warriors and for years you are close to making the playoffs but then you lose in the first round if you do make it. Now, you trade some players or aquire all stars such as adding super all star Kevin Durant. You win the championship. Now, going back to Netflix is that they are not staying competitive and when Walmart which is way bigger than netflix will ever be starting their streaming service or how google is buying up the Virtual Reality sector you will see why Netflix will not compete.

4094,"For the naysayers (and the longs who know a good company and investment when they see one):Netflix is a positive cash flow company, they are making money hand over fist. They currently owe more than they make, but as they gain subscribers (projected 200+ million by 2020) and pay the debt down NFLX will become one of the wealthiest companies on the planet. Companies borrow money all the time, even blue chip companies, to invest in growth and infrastructure. FB borrowed a ton of money before they were net positive, so did Sirius XM and AMZN. The math is there, and it's simple, that's why the stock price is what it is, with 79%+ institutional investment. The institutional investment wouldn't be so high if the banks didn't see a golden goose. Shorties just want to try and drive the price down with nonsense so they can make a 4-5% gain here or there, while us longs are already up over 100% on the year. I know what side I'd rather be on with this stock. The shorts are going to get burned and then cry that it's manipulation or some other nonsense. It's hilarious how no matter how well a stock is doing, there is always the ""sky is falling"" types that cry doom and gloom. If they'd care to take a look at numbers, NFLX only has a 4.5% short interest on its share float. That's literally like saying 4.5 out of 100 people think the stock is going to go down in the short term. That's extremely low. Most shorters don't have the stomach to watch a 5-10% rise above their short price, and they close with a loss; that is going to happen with the short float leading up to earnings, and we might get a nice little 2-3% squeeze on top of the next rally.

However, recently Netflix has seen a major pullback as investors started to worry about rising competition.In just two months, NFLX stock has seen its share price fall nearly 20% after the company’s second-quarter results underwhelmed the market. To be sure, Netflix isn’t flying as high as it once was, but the firm’s commitment to creating quality content is likely to keep the service from succumbing to the increasing competition in the streaming space. Plus, although NFLX is nearing saturation in the U.S., the firm still has a huge growth opportunity in India, where its content has been well-received so far.

4333,"LOL @ Netflix. When your biggest competitor is Amazon.com, should your stock trade at 300 times earnings? Nope! You should have a bankruptcy lawyer on speed dial. It's hilarious that Netflix trades like a world-beating monopoly. When in fact they compete against the deadliest and richest competitors on the planet: Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon. Will Netflix survive? Sure, quite possibly. But should Netflix trade at the most expensive valuation of any company in the market? LOL. Just ask Excite, MySpace, Nokia, and Barnes and Noble! Competing against any ONE of Google, Facebook, Apple, or Amazon tends not to be fun or fruitful. Competing against all of them at once is REALLY not fun! I wonder if Netflix could possibly revisit its 2017 levels? In 2017 the stock traded in the 100s all year. Now, just 15 weeks later, it's trading in the 300s! Is this a permanent change?

4681,I have a question. I'm looking at the nasdaq right now and looking at the 3 year/weekly chart. I see that when there is a huge negative event that occurs that the nasdaq corrects to the 200 sma line. 2 events I see were 12/24/18 & 3/23/20. If the treasury yields rises to very high levels does that mean at the very least that the nasdaq will correct the 50 sma line? The 50 sma and 200 sma line are stretched extremely far apart right now which is telling me that assets are hyper inflated as well. Wouldn't these 2 lines eventually snap back closer together?

4936,"NFLX TARGET RAISED TO $310.Netflix Poised to Extend Lead Despite Content Glut -- Barron's Blog2/2018- DJNFBy Jon SwartzDespite an increasingly crowded field for content, Netflix (NFLX) is poised to extend its content and distribution tentacles over the next 12 to 18 months.GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives bases his bullish assessment on Netflix's ""competitive moat,"" franchise appeal, ability to increase international streaming customers through 2020, and originalcontent. He gives it a Highly Attractive rating and raised its price target from $255 to $310 to reflect stronger-than-expected net subscription additions and international growth through 2018.Shares of Netflix are up 3% to $273.91 today.Ives expects Netflix to spend $7 billion to $8 billion on content this year, up about $1 billion from its spending trajectory for 2017. About one-third will go toward original content in 2018, with a long-term target of 50% by 2020.As more consumers eschew cable for streaming delivery, Netflix should anticipate heightened competition from larger media players such as Disney (DIS) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA), pure-play competitors such as Amazon.com (AMZN), and new potential entrants like Apple (AAPL).""The holy grail of incremental growth (and profitability) going forward will be from international customers as we believe Netflix has a [total addressable market] of over 700M subs by 2020,"" Ives wrote in his note. ""With the company spending major resources over the last two years building out a global distribution arm and customer base in over 100 countries, we believe the fruits of this labor will start to be fully realized in 2018 and beyond as evidenced again by the strong international performance in 4Q.""",0.9887

MKM analyst Rob Sanderson raised his subscriber outlook for Netflix for 2018, saying the company has yet to reach its peak year for total subscriber additions. ""We continue to view Netflix as the large cap with the most potential for market cap appreciation over the next three to four years,"" Sanderson wrote in a note to investors. Sanderson said he expects Netflix to add 20.6 million subscribers next year, which is roughly in line with FactSet consensus of 20.9 million, but would be down from 2017 consensus of 22.0 million subscriber additions. This year was expected to be the streaming service's peak for subscriber additions, but Sanderson said it's more likely to come in 2019 or 2020.

And let’s not forget that unlike Disney and Amazon, Netflix doesn’t have any plans to entice subscribers with other offerings such as live sports."" And then, as any fundamental investors knows the balance sheet matters, ""Plus, Amazon, Disney, and Apple all have much more money to pour into content."" (which I have been stating in debates with garolou over and over. So while NFLX has to borrown junk bonds at a high rate to produce this content, these other firms have cash sitting on their books.

5106,"How is a single ""TV channel"" with 1/5 of the revenue and 1/20 of the profit be worth 90% of Disney? Is al this hype really about content? That is absurd, and while Netflix is a fine company, it is way overvalued. If it is all about content then Disney should be 5X the market cap of Netflix. Disney has a TV channel, plus they produce blockbuster films, they own Marvel, Star Wars (Lucas Films), Pixar, ABC and ESPN (additional channels that produce their own content); plus Disney has real assets - namely two theme parks that throw off billions in profits annually and the real estate itself is valued at $3-4 billion. But business is not all about content. That is just moronic hype. Business is about making money, period. Disney has multiple streams of income and much of it is all integrated. Make a princess movie that makes $100-300 million in profit, sell gobs of profitable toys and costumes of said princess along with other profitable royalties, then charge families $400 so their daughter can dress up like the princess and eat chicken tenders with her in a castle in Orlando. Netflix has none of those highly profitable additional income streams. Any media company could easily start competing with Netflix just by streaming their content. Netflix doesn't own the pipe to its customers like Comcast who sells content and high-speed internet over the same cable, two income streams. Amazon does what Netflix does but its service costs less and you get free 2-day shipping on just about anything you order. Netflix is absolutely overvalued and I think will trade below $100 within 2-3 years. It may have peaked recently and the options market definitely is bearish on this stock. CBO market is not always right in the short-term, but often has a pretty good read on the overall prospects for a companies future stock price.",0.9928

Shares of Netflix, after hitting a record close on Monday, were up more than 1% in early Tuesday trade. Wlodarczak increased his long-term international subscriber forecast, expecting the streaming giant to hit 250 million international subscribers by 2024, up from 230 million. In its most recent fourth-quarter earnings report, Netflix said it had 62.8 million international subscribers. ""The company appears to operate in a virtuous cycle, as the larger their subscriber base grows the more they can spend on original content, which increases the potential target market for their service and dramatically increases barriers to entry,"" Wlodarczak wrote in a note. ""All else being equal with the broader markets, as long as Netflix continues to beat and raise on subscribers we believe the stock will continue to work."" Wlodarczak also raised his long-term expectations on average revenue per user as Netflix displayed pricing power after its most recent price hike had little to no negative impact on subscriber growth. Shares of Netflix have gained 122% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 index is up roughly 15%.Here are red flags on his analysis:-This analyst see 250Million subscriber suddenly jump from already increase 230 Million count for no reason. Now from 67M to 250 Milion in 6 year, each year they need to add 30M+ subscriber. Now looking into US short history, This is unlikely. Remember Most english speaking developed Foreign country reaching saturation point. Non English speaking, There isn't much content and with licensing cost increases and focus on own content that gap will get wider not smaller.Now Value:- Clearly reaching 250M mean not much growth left. And then company likely issue $30B+ stocks over 6 year period. at current price that mean it will value at $160B + likely $20B debt so $180B enterprise value.with 250M international you will have 320M total (70M is beyond peak I think but just get over optimistic) $10M = $36B revenue, They likely spending $20B on content (Only way they can reach 320M subscriber is spend lot more on content) , $5B on marketing , $5B on servers and $2b-3B on other = $33BIn other word still generate $3B profit. Even if we raise subscription by 20% it still likely <$10B profit in 2024..If you give 20 PE and discount 35% (Growth rate), You still comeup with <$150 fair market price.",0.9943
