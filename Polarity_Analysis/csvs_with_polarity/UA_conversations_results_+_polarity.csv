I could've taken my 15% profit and ran, but I see this stock easily hitting $25 by year's end - ESPECIALLY after next quarter earnings and seeing the uptick in shoe sales after the company's recent arrangements and efforts to globalize take effect.

Now, 2 months later, he downgrades the stock to a sell and says that it should be at $11. His reason is that UA is selling to discounter like Kohls and DWS, and its branding is staying with the athletic and not expanding towards leisure.

Numbers will be record levels for UA $25 IS COMING WE KNOW02:16 PM EDT, 04/06/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Athletic footwear sales are continuing to grow at the fastest clip in the industry, with March sales up a ""historic"" 40% to 50% year over year, UBS said in a note April 6.The US fiscal stimulus is likely responsible for two-thirds of the growth spurt with reopening of the economy from coronavirus restrictions accounting for another 25%. Sales for 2021 should grow 10% over 2019 with the back-to-school period providing a boost.The brokerage's report is based on a call it hosted with the CEO of a privately held footwear retailer.""The expert's conclusion is fiscal stimulus is boosting all parts of the business and thus reopening probably only explains a portion of the acceleration,"" UBS said. ""As reopening becomes a bigger factor, dress category and store-level sales will rebound more sharply, while [e-commerce] and athletic sales growth rates normalize.""UBS raised full-year 2021/22 EPS estimates for most footwear stocks in its coverage universe: Boot Barn(BOOT) , Columbia Sportswear(COLM) , Crocs(CROX) , Designer Brands(DBI) , Deckers Outdoor(DECK) , Foot Locker(FL) , Steven Madden (SHOO), Skechers (SKX), Under Armour(UAA) , V.F.

Take that out of the equation and just look at the business fundamentals. The Current Ratio is above 2.0, the Debt Ratio just sits under .50 and the company has been profitable for the last 5+ years. Only this year there has been a loss the first 2 quarters but there is still a profit for Q3. Q4 we don't know but we do know is that even if they lose money for 2017, it will not impact the company's financials. They are sitting on so much cash that another loss for 2018 won't harm them. If anyone has run a business before, they know what to look for and Kevin Plank is not a fool. Look at all the CEOS and Co-founders of companies on Fortune 500 companies. Most of them are 60+ years old while Kevin is in his 40's. He takes risks but that is what a young business leader does if he wants to take his business to the next level. Look at his YouTube interview videos and how his business principles align with Under Armour's. All you guys saying company is going bankrupt and UA going under needs to do more due diligence.Company is still growing in annual sales. JUST NOT wall street expectations. BUT who gives a #$%$ about what wall street thinks! Take that out of the equation and you got a company growing in annual sales 7-10% is still #$%$ good. This stock is getting beaten but if you are looking for a long term value (I mean 10+ years), right now is a good time to load up and if dips more, then re-load up.

People are not going to pay $100-150 for shoes that are considered ""uncool"" and deemed as the laughing stock of shoes. If you go on Under Armours website and browse what they have available, you can tell why their shoes sales have been lagging for several years now. The competition is fierce as ever before with Nike and Adidas who are hiring the best designers and putting the best product out on the floor. UA has a golden opportunity with Steph Curry and I do mean GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY. He is among the top 5 most popular players this game has ever seen. He is right up their with MJ, Kobe, and Lebron in terms of his global footprint. If Plank cant advantage of this once in a lifetime opportunity with Steph then I dont think he will ever be able to do it with another superstar.",0.9924

Why continue to bash??? Read this good advise from last month authored by a current basher prior to dumping your shares.Johnlast month$UA conversationThink about this...everyone was falling over their feet for this company and stock up till now while stock was hitting all-time highs. Now, the stock is at a 70% discount and people hate it. This is CLASSIC. What really fundamentally changed other than the price of the stock? If someone were to offer you a dollar for a dollar, that isn't a great deal(UA at all-time high's and everyone loved this deal apparently as it was happening)....now the dollar within a year becomes a quarter and everyone thinks a quarter for a dollar or two over the next 7 years is a horrible deal. Long story short...people will never learn. Look at 2008....stock market sold off 60%....ppl were selling their stocks at lows....nobody liked the market....hated it...now the market hits all-time highs ever single day...PPL love it. lol. Suckers are born every single day. This stock is becoming more of a bargain every day now that it has sold off 70%. It isn't going bankrupt. It is GROWING. One should study oneself. I personally have no money invested in this anymore. But am thinking about getting back in as it continues to bottom out. Company has done what noboddy has predicted in 72 months. The stock price will sort itself out in time. Fools selling at these prices while buying high. Should not play the game. -ZJohnJohnlast monthReplied to a reaction$UA conversationso if someone bought at $25/share and 10 years from now...the stock is at 200/share....he lost what? Exactly. Warren Buffet and other smart money managers don't catch bottoms...they buy when a stock gets cheap understanding it can get cheaper. That's why people who are long term investors DCA....they aren't trying to sell when it goes lower if the company they like gets cheaper, they continue investing. All those who sold Amazon or even Apple during sell-offs...where are they now? Not as wealthy or wealthy period. Those who held or invested more....well you know where they are. That's how it works. Short term is impossible to predict. But UA's stock got ahead of itself...but the impacts its made in the sporting world in the last 72 months...tremendous and going to continue to reap rewards as the company learns from its current mistakes and gets better.

2636,"Curry, the Golden State Warriors’ two-time NBA MVP, has a endorsement contract with Under Armour running through 2024 that’s reportedly worth more than $4 million a year.On Tuesday, Plank told CNBC that Trump was good for American business. “To have such a pro-business president is something that is a real asset for the country,” he said. On Wednesday, the company released a statement that stressed it was focused on business issues, not Trump’s controversial actions. “We engage in policy, not politics,” the statement said.In an interview with the San Jose Mercury News, Curry said he was surprised that Plank had praised Trump, but that didn’t mean he would leave the sneaker and apparel company — yet. “It’s a fine line but it’s about how we’re operating,” Curry said, “how inclusive we are, what we stand for.”But Curry said he would leave if that fine line were crossed. “If I can say the leadership is not in line with my core values, then there is no amount of money, there is no platform I wouldn’t jump off if it wasn’t in line with who I am.”Losing Curry would be a disaster for Under Armour UAA, +2.98% . Curry is the company’s most important athlete endorsement, with Morgan Stanley pegging his value to Under Armour at $14.1 billion in 2016.

The average consumer of UA products isn't going through anything unless it's the doors of a McDonald's restaurant. UA lacks the critical ability to identify its core consumer because they're not athletes. They're average Joes and Janes who just want something cool to wear. Unfortunately, UA as a brand is not cool when their branding is this corny. UA's sneakers are also corny. Listen to the kids on the street. No one buys UA sneakers for this reason.

3008,"Insider selling to be investigated:Plank last sold Under Armour shares amounting to 1.05 million in a series of transactions from Apr. 21 to Apr. 29 last year. The sales were well-timed. Jut six months later, Under Armour's red-hot growth came to a screeching halt in the third quarter amid a fresh wave of department store closures and the bankruptcy of The Sports Authority. In effect, those harsh new realities removed vital places for Under Armour to hawk compression shirts and joggers and led to a groundswell of discounted inventory at off-price channels such as TJX Companies (TJX) . Under Armour's lackluster third quarter along with a major long-term profit warning sent shares plunging by over 20% on Oct. 25.",-0.2214

Mr. Plank said Under Armour is in the execution stage of the company's business model - hopefully us shareholders will be rewarded. They sold out their 3D shoes at the beginning of this quarter. The design your own shoe is unique and will increase shoe sales. Also, I believe the move into Kohls is a good thing - as a previous poster mentioned, Adidas and Nike also sell at Kohls - This is a BUY before earnings.
