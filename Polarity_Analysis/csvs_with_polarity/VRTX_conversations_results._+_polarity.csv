So, by inhibiting the checkpoint with VX-970, tumor cells can enter the G2 phase without completing the DNA replication. This has catastrophic consequence because daughter cells would not have a complete set of chromosomes. http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6404/806?utm_campaign=toc_sci-mag_2018-08-23&et_rid=16759399&et_cid=2306314When ATR and DRPK inhibitors were licensed to Merck-Germany last year it was thought that they were merely inhibitors of DNA repair inhibitors.

I think investors simply do not anticipate a catalyst to the upside and may be just cashing out for the fear that it may keep going down. The Trump drug price control publicity also is not helping.As I have said before, The BOD should initiate an up to a 10 million share buyback in open markets. Buy backs do not pose any legal issues for the company as long as they stop the buyback when material information becomes available to the company. Examples are new revenue stream agreements, new drug efficacy results, offers to take over the company etc. Also an open market repurchase announcement need not be completed if the PPS becomes too expensive based on below:""1. Open market stock buybackA company buys back its shares directly from the market. The transactions are executed via the company’s brokers. The buyback of shares generally happens over a long period of time as a large number of shares must be bought. At the same time, unlike other methods, stock buybacks via open market do not impose any legal obligations on a company to complete the buyback program.Thus, a company enjoys the flexibility to cancel the stock buyback program at any time. The primary advantage of the open market stock buyback is its cost-effectiveness because a company buys back its shares at the current market price and doesn’t need to pay a premium.""https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/strategy/stock-buyback-methods/So no new development pending, and the pps getting hammered most days lately, it seems to me an open market buyback send a message to investors that the BOD and the management have confidence in the company.",0.997

Clearly a strong motivator for patients not yet on Orkambi to get started and stick with it until next gen treatments prove to be more effective. Should boost compliance and persistence on treatment as well as motivate new starts in the 2000 US patients who have not yet started treatment. Should also improve pricing negotiation outcomes ongoing in the EU Canada and Australia where approvals for Orkambi payment are ongoing or about to get started. Benefit of Orkambi in 508dd pediatric patients ages 6-11 also reported today in Phase 3 trial results with little initial respiratory adverse effects reported and positive efficacy should promote rapid uptake in the US over the next 2 quarters and Orkambi approval in this younger population in the EU next year. /The significance of this data will likely be highlighted in tonight's conference call, along with the news from yesterday's announcement of the initiation of triple therapy phase 2 clinical trials using second gen correctors in combination with 661 (tezacaftor) and Ivacaftor, offering hope for effective treatment of the underlying cause of CF in the largest remaining and most challenging CF subpopulation (het-min group) still awaiting this kind of treatment.",0.9972

First of all, what's beyond CF in terms of trends to find disease areas really is, we think, consistent with what we've learned in CF. That is we're really only interested in transformative medicines in serious diseases that we can sell into these specialty areas with relatively low SG&A, which will then allow us to recycle most of our OpEx back into R&D. That's the model, and we're going to stick to that model as we move beyond CF. And then we view internal research and BD as essentially complementary, often even looking at the same diseases using some internal programs and some external programs. And so for instance, we've talked about sickle cell disease as a program that we're interested in because it does fit that profile. We have an internal small molecule program or several of them actually in sickle cell disease. We have our collaboration with CRISPR in sickle cell disease, and we may even look at additional outside programs.

118,"Earning Likely to Double: Based in Boston, Vertex is a pharmaceutical company that specializes in treatments for cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is a progressive, genetic disease that causes persistent lung infections and – over time – limits the ability to breathe. More than 30,000 people in the U.S. are living with cystic fibrosis, more than 70,000 worldwide. Those who survive into adulthood generally don’t live past the age of 38. Among drug companies, Vertex is an anomaly. While it has plans to treat other rare diseases like sickle cell and genetic liver conditions, its pipeline is almost solely cystic fibrosis drugs. The company currently treats 31,000 patients worldwide with its two cystic fibrosis drugs: Kalydeco and Orkambi. Those two drugs – alone or in combination with a drug known as lumacaftor – serve the vast majority of those receiving treatment. Vertex expects to soon get approval of a third treatment that combines its two drugs with the drug tezacaftor. Beyond that, it wants to use gene editing to treat the last 10% of cystic fibrosis patients who don’t respond to existing medications.In adults who already have lung damage, the new combination improves lung function within two weeks. But the company’s goal is to also prevent infants with the genetic disorder from ever developing the disease.We’ll see the next earnings report here January 31. I expect Vertex earned $1.97 a share for 2017 – and those earnings are likely to double this year.",0.9808

122,"April 9, 2021 07:11 AM EDTUpdated 08:17 AM PharmaRegulatoryCBO: Congressional action on drug prices will make R&D spending less attractiveZachary BrennanSenior EditorThe greed of pharmaceutical companies has long been one of the reasons Congress has sought to reign in the industry’s high price tags for new drugs.But a new report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on Thursday pours cold water on the idea that large pharma companies are pumping all their profits into share buybacks, marketing, and CEO salaries. In fact, the CBO notes that pharma spending on drug R&D ramped up by nearly 50% between 2015 and 2019, and now outpaces what other similar industries, like software and semiconductor companies, spend on R&D.Smaller companies are also shouldering some of that increase in R&D spending in recent years. Companies with annual revenues of less than $500 million now account for more than 70% of the nearly 3,000 drugs in Phase III clinical trials, the CBO says.“The share of R&D funded directly by revenues has declined in recent years because an increasing amount of R&D is now conducted by research-oriented drug companies with few or no products on the market,” the report notes. “Over the past decade, small or emerging drug companies have developed a rising share of new drugs. Those companies have relatively little revenue (some have none at all), and most of them must seek outside financing, such as venture capital, and collaborative agreements with larger drug companies.”",0.995

Morgan -- AnalystHey, good afternoon, guys and thank you for taking my questions. Two of them for you. On the AAT program, has the IDMC been taking regular looks at the 864 safety database and would you characterize this is a situation where no news is good news on the safety front or is that still premature where you are in enrollment? And then also in this program, I think, what's the -- in terms of relative levels of functional serum AAT, what would give you conviction that you're on to something here and provide added confidence going into the next stage of development? Thank you.Reshma Kewalramani -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentHey, Cory, this is Reshma. Let me take both of those questions for you. The AATD program is indeed followed very carefully as we do all of our programs honestly from a safety perspective, and that is just part of what we do. So that is ongoing. With regard to levels and maybe broadly speaking, what are we really looking for from this VX-864 Phase 2 proof-of-concept study really three things, the first is safety. This is the first time that VX-864 is going to patients with AATD. The second is PK and exposure and the third is increases in functional AAT levels. I'm also going to be looking to see if there is a dose effect relationship. The key here remember is that, this is our first time to close the loop on cracking the biology.That's to say, if we see levels of functional AAT increase in this study, we see a dose effect. What that tells us, is that the mechanism that we projected to be the mechanism that could target both lung and liver raise AAT level, we got it. And as I always say we divide drug development, Vertex into two parts, cracking the biology, pouring on the chemistry.",0.9942

Kymera is now trading at around $30.""In May 2019, Vertex entered into a collaboration agreement with Kymera (amended on August 27, 2020 as to terms not material to this description, the “Collaboration Agreement”). As initial consideration for the collaboration, Vertex paid Kymera $70 million upfront, which included a non-refundable upfront payment of $50 million and an equity investment in Kymera through the purchase by Vertex of 3,059,695 shares of Kymera Series B-1 preferred stock at a purchase price of $6.5366 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $20 million. In connection with its equity investment, Vertex holds certain rights to invest, in its sole discretion, in future private placements or public securities offerings by Kymera on a pro rata basis, subject to certain conditions. The Series B-1 preferred stock held by Vertex converted to Shares of common stock at the IPO Closing.Under the Collaboration Agreement, the parties established a joint advisory committee that will, among other responsibilities, review and oversee certain strategic activities performed under the Collaboration Agreement, including reviewing the research plan and budget for the research activities and reviewing the research activities performed by each party.The initial research term of the collaboration is four years, extendable for an additional one-year period upon mutual agreement by the parties and payment by Vertex of certain per-target fees.The Collaboration Agreement may be terminated by Vertex either in its entirety or on a target-by-target basis upon prior written notice to Kymera. Either party may terminate the Collaboration Agreement upon the other party’s material breach, subject to specified notice and cure provisions, or upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or winding up of the other party. Kymera also has the right to terminate the Collaboration Agreement with respect to a certain target upon 30 days’ prior written notice in the event that Vertex ceases all research, development and commercialization activities related to such target for a certain period of time, provided that the cessation is not the result of events outside of Vertex’s control.In March 2020, Vertex purchased 887,311 shares of Kymera’s Series C preferred stock at a price of $6.5366 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.8 million.

However, the new drug if it is successful is a complementary drug to VRTX and not a competing drug. I think lost of investor are just reacting to headline and not reading the text, if at all.California-based Synedgen has spun out its experimental cystic fibrosis treatments into a new biotech to be based in the Boston area, with an eye toward complementing existing drugs for the lung disease.The new company, called Synspira, launched on Thursday with $8 million in financing from an anonymous investor and an exclusive license to privately-held Synedgen’s preclinical program for cystic fibrosis. Synspira is operating virtually — the CEO, Synedgen chief operating officer Shenda Baker, is its only current full-time employee — but the company is looking for physical office space in the Boston area. The best-selling drugs for cystic fibrosis, made by Boston-based VertexPharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: VRTX), target the underlying cause of the disease — a wide range of genetic mutations. Synspira, by contrast, is developing treatments that target the buildup of mucus and bacteria in the lungs. Doing so could boost the effectiveness of antibiotics and improve lung function, the company believes.The drugs are made of modified sugar molecules, which are designed to loosen mucus and prevent the buildup of bacteria on the surface of the lungs — a condition that can act as a shield to antibiotics. Synspira's most advanced drug is expected to enter a Phase 1 study in 2018, Baker said in an interview.“There are dozens of different (genetic) defects, and it's hard to target them all,” she said. “As Vertex’s drugs and others’ move forward, our drug will be able to assist in pulmonary decline, by clearing out and removing infections that make lungs function less effectively.”Among local firms, Norwood-based Corbus Pharmaceuticals is also developing a cystic fibrosis drug that is designed to manage the potentially deadly inflammation caused by the disease.

268,"An update on VRTX Parion partnership that dates back to 2015 to explore use of Enac inhibitors in the treatment of CF.In January this year, VRTX sold back the rights to develop the Parion Enac inhibitors in the treatment of CF and PCD (because of lack of sufficient efficacy). Maybe ARWR Enac inhibitors will work better in CF? Maybe not..... Trikafta sets a very high bar.... Parion Sciences Reacquires Rights to Epithelial Sodium Channel InhibitorsDurham, NC (January 23, 2020) – Parion Sciences, a company dedicated to the development ofnovel treatments for pulmonary diseases, announced today that it has reached an agreementwith Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to reacquire the pulmonary rights to epithelial sodiumchannel (ENaC) inhibitors developed under a collaboration announced between the parties in2015. Under this agreement, Vertex is eligible to receive future undisclosed royalties basedupon commercial success.During their collaboration, the companies evaluated P-1037/VX-371 in multiple Phase 2 clinicalstudies as a potential treatment for cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia patients. Inclinical studies, P-1037/VX-371 was generally well tolerated.“Parion appreciates Vertex’s support over the course of our collaboration by progressing P1037 into multiple patient populations.” said Paul Boucher, President, Parion Sciences. “At thistime, Parion is evaluating scenarios for P-1037’s continued development as a potential therapytreating those patients who suffer from diseases as a result of mucus obstruction.”About ENaC Inhibitors and P-1037Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) inhibitors are designed to block the sodium channels on theairway surfaces. In pulmonary diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cysticfibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia, where there is a build-up of excessively concentratedmucus, preclinical models have demonstrated that blocking ENaC hydrates the mucus on thelung surface. Hydration of airway mucus restores airway clearance and improves lung function.P-1037 is a novel, long acting ENaC Inhibitor that was well tolerated at the doses tested inmultiple clinical trials in healthy volunteers and patients with either cystic fibrosis or primaryciliary dyskinesia.About Parion SciencesParion Sciences is a development stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to research,development and commercialization of treatments to improve and extend the lives of patientswith innate mucosal surface defense deficiencies of the airways. Parion has a diverse pipelineof pre-clinical and clinical candidates for the treatment of these diseases via distinctivemechanisms of action and approaches. Parion is at the forefront of ENaC development and isleveraging our scientific expertise in epithelial biology to expand our platforms and novelchemical compounds into new indications to treat mucosal defects. Parion has receivedsupport and grant funding from the National Institutes of Health and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc.

274,"3rd qtr conference call gave a lot of new information. Pain meds e.g. VX 150, and additional Na1.8 inhibitors likely to be marketed by a small VRTX sales force directly to specialty markets for some acute pain indications. To treat chronic pain due to OA/chronic back pain, they plan on partnering it to a larger pharma with a large primary care sales force for that indication. (This would be a cost effective way to maximize profitability from this treatment by limiting size of needed sales force while still profiting from partnering the drug for sales to primary care market for chronic pain indications.) Crisper cas 9 data for SCA and thalassemia apparently going to be available in 2019 (not 2020 as originally projected). Likewise AAT clinical trials starting at the end of year will have data likely available in 2019. Positive data from these early clinical trials will open the door to rapid enrollment in mid-stage trials and add huge potential value to VRTX. FSG patients will also likely have treatments entering clinical trials to treat this terrible chronic kidney disease in 2019. In the meantime, triple drug CF Phase 3 trials will be reporting starting the end of this year into first quarter 2019 with NDA filing for at least one triple CF treatment to be filed with the FDA no later than mid-2019 to treat potentially 90% of all CF patients affording them potentially normal life expectancy with normal lives if treatment is started early enough. Competition from GLPG and PTI did not seem to be a concern to VRTX management, who cited competitors needing to surpass the 'high bar' established by VRTX triple drugs, soon to be approved, and the time it will take for competitors to develop viable proven drugs with long term data to demonstrate both safety and efficacy. (Not just 2 weeks of interim data in a handful of patients recently reported). Long term investors in VRTX should feel confident in this company's pipeline and record of success.

Rather than correcting the disease-causing mutation in gene directly, the therapy targets a region of DNA that acts like a brake on production of a form of hemoglobin that the body usually stops making after the first months of life, called fetal hemoglobin. In the rare cases when a genetic variant keeps production turned on well into childhood and even adulthood, even people with β-thalassemia (or sickle cell) have enough healthy hemoglobin to avoid the worst symptoms of those sometimes-fatal diseases.The CRISPR therapy being tested is called ex vivo, meaning that blood cells are taken from a patient and altered in the lab (much like CAR-T cancer therapy) and then returned to the patient. In this case, CRISPR molecules are introduced to the blood cells via electroporation, and the genome editor alters the fetal hemoglobin “brake.” If all goes well, the CRISPR’d cells will then produce red blood cells that contain fetal hemoglobin.“This is one important step of many toward bringing the promise of this new technology to patients with serious diseases like sickle cell and beta thalassemia, and we are thrilled to be at the forefront of what we believe may be a fundamental change in the treatment of disease,” Vertex spokesperson Heather Nichols said.In May, CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex announced that the Food and Drug Administration had placed a “clinical hold” on the companies’ application to test CTX001 in sickle cell in a U.S. study, but that the planned Phase 1/2 trial in Europe in adults with β-thalassemia was on track. That is the trial that is now recruiting patients. ...]]",0.9855
312,"I think we have lead program beta thalassemia and sickle cell. We’re enrolling patients. I’ll talk more about this program and we’re partnered with Vertex Pharmaceuticals on this program 50-50, and we’re jointly advancing this program in what could be the best-in-class medicine for these patients suffering from thalassemia and sickle cell.A few words on hemoglobinopathies, these diseases are devastating blood diseases, both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia results in significant co-morbidities and early death. In the case of sickle cell disease, where you have as a root cause is a mutation in the beta-globin gene. In the case of thalassemia, there is a mutation in many parts of the gene, which could result in a deficiency of beta-globin, which is a subunit of adult hemoglobin and in both these cases, you have significant morbidity and mortality, but not only that, there is a very heavy burden on patient care,, the cost of managing severe sickle-cell patient in the US is over $300,000 per year as shown by recent publications release from CMS.In these indications, what we’re doing is recapitulating nature. There have been a number of studies across populations around the world, which showed that if patients or people I should say have high fetal hemoglobin even if they have the genetics of sickle-cell thalassemia they’re asymptomatic or their symptoms go down the higher the fetal hemoglobin. Now what’s happening here?We have two copies or two forms of the hemoglobin. One is adult hemoglobin and the second is fetal hemoglobin. We’re all born with fetal hemoglobin and within six months of being born, our body has a rail tree mechanism where the fetal hemoglobin is down regulated and the adult hemoglobin takes over. In some people because of their existing mutation are some other editorial elements, their fetal hemoglobin is never turned off and they have higher levels of fetal hemoglobin and even if you have the genetics of thalassemia or sickle-cell, they can overcome that with the high levels of fetal hemoglobin.These studies of patient populations, led us do this approach where we actually use CRISPR Cas9 to recreate the same mutation seen in nature to elevate fetal hemoglobin and overcome the deficiency or defectiveness of betaglobin gene. This was all supported by a number of preclinical studies that went into our R&D the CTA filings and then we started these two trials CLIMB-111 and CLIMB-121 trials and these were the pioneering Crisper trials where we’ve dosed more than 20 patients across both of these indications. The trials are designed in a way where while their Phase 1, 2, they could be registration trials for patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia and severe sickle cell disease. We’ve started these trials in patients of age 12 to 35 but we’ve indicated that we’ve expanded this our chronic status into pediatric populations as well as we see efficacy and safety in the early patients that we’ve treated.I’ll talk more about the patients in each of these, but essentially, we showed data first in November of 2019 and then subsequently at [indiscernible] Nash Conference last year and this data on Slide eight showed data from TDT transfusion-dependent thalassemia and what you’re seeing in these data are that within a couple of months of being treated with CTX001 you’re seeing significant elevation of HVF which is fetal hemoglobin and while you’re seeing this chart is a dark blue is HBA. This is adult hemoglobin from the transfuse blood that these patients have and that decays over time, but then the fetal hemoglobin takes over and becomes the majority of that compartment and what you’re seeing are very high levels of fetal hemoglobin expression in these patients that render them transfusion independent.So you have patients coming in and it’s the first patient that was treated was a 19-year old female at the time who came in with requiring more than one transfusion a month significant burden on quality of life, significant anemia, all the risks of organ damage from severe thalassemia and after that patient has been treated, they have normal hemoglobin levels on account of the elevated fetal hemoglobin and that’s gone out now over 18 months. So this is a very durable therapy as well.",0.9903
313,"Barrons had a good article on p53 and gene-editing:https://www.barrons.com/articles/gene-editing-selloff-is-overdone-1529107202[[... The two papers in Nature Medicine showed that scientists could boost the efficiency of CRISPR gene correction by turning off a gene called p53, which is part of a cell’s natural safeguard against genetic damage. Because about half of all cancers involve an impairment of p53’s function, the Karolinska team warned that CRISPR developers should be careful not to gain efficiency in gene correction by crimping p53. The companion paper, by researchers at the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass., said that gene-edited cells should be tested to ensure they’ve got functional p53. Novartis told Barron’s it plans to pursue therapies based on CRISPR, “while thoroughly investigating safety.”The CRISPR companies each said last week they hadn’t found p53 to be a hindrance. Editas spokeswoman Cristi Barnett told Barron’s that p53 activity is vital to keeping cells from accumulating unwanted mutations and shouldn’t be inhibited to enhance a CRISPR treatment. In its preclinical work, Editas hasn’t had to inhibit it. “We can now achieve much higher targeted integration rates and gene correction without suppressing p53,” she said. Intellia CEO John Leonard said his company is beyond the laboratory stage of CRISPR described in the science studies. He also noted the Nature Medicine studies used special types of cells unlike those targeted by Intellia and its peers.Crispr Therapeutics peaked near $74 last month after the company and partner Vertex Pharmaceuticals(VRTX) filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the country’s first clinical trial of CRISPR.

If they are thinking about the underperforming sales, this has to do with compliance and safety. VX-661/Kal combo will rectify this issue somewhat, and a future triple combo will improve the treatment for heterozygous as well as homozygous 508 CF if it is safe.•The 661/Kalydeco double is also not likely to perform better than Orkambi.The duo of 661/Kal will be safer and more effective than Orkambi. If this were not the case, Vertex must have chosen a triple containing Lumacaftor not 661 for treatment of 508 CF.Furthermore, this duo can be used for the certain heterozygous 508 mutations. A 70% of gating and residual function mutations has 508 mutation in the other allele. This means that 661/Kal duo will be more effective than Kal alone for these mutations because 661 acts on 508 allele and Kal will work on gating and residual mutation allele.•Ongoing final stage program of 661 is not likely to yield any commercial upside.This is absurd because a better drug will have a better commercial value. •The expected triple combo continued to be far way.Nobody knows how far away.•Even if triple combo is successful, it could only be a replacement and not complement Orkambi.This is also an absurd statement. A triple combo can be effective for all heterozygous 508 CF mutations as well as for the homozygous mutation. Orkambi is not effective against most heterozygous 508.•The previous M&A thesis is at its lowest point of any likelihood.Who needs M&A! This stock can double from here if the triple is safe.",0.9976

Vertex replied to Benzinga, ""We do not comment on market rumors or speculation. Vertex's Board of Directors and management are focused on continuing to create significant value for our shareholders by executing our long-term strategy of delivering transformative medicines for people with serious diseases.""The part that says ""Vertex's Board of Directors and management are focused on continuing to create significant value for our shareholders...."" must be a joke. They have been at it with Boger and a while ago, Laden, at the helm since 1989 and have failed miserably.

These include sickle-cell disease, kidney diseases, antitrypsin deficiency (which can lead to liver and kidney disease) and acute pain. Since 2015, Vertex has grown its cash hoard from $1.0 billion to $3.2 billion, or 47% annually.Vertex also has been able to achieve financial success with a relatively low penetration of its existing market in the U.S., Europe and Australia. Currently, just 18,000 patients are on Vertex cystic fibrosis medicines against 37,000 who are eligible.Further, the company believes it can expand the eligibility pool in two ways. First, by ""expanding the label,"" Vertex can treat younger patients and increase the eligibility pool to about 44,000 patients.

585,"The diabetes 'cure' Vertex acquired in its 2019 Semma buyout? It's headed to the clinicMax GelmanAssociate EditorThe stem cell-derived therapy at the center of Vertex’s $950 million buyout of Semma Therapeutics in 2019, one that features prominently in the company’s overall cell and gene therapy push, is one step closer to reaching the clinic.Vertex is expected to launch a Phase I/II trial in the first half of this year after the type 1 diabetes treatment received IND clearance from the FDA on Thursday, the company announced. The program, dubbed VX-880, will be evaluated in type 1 diabetes patients with severe hypoglycemia and those who struggle to perceive the onset of hypoglycemia, like young children.Researchers will try to determine the safety and proper dosage in the study, which will be single-arm and open-label. Vertex plans to enroll about 17 patients. VX-880 itself uses stem-cell derived pancreatic islet cells to try to restore the body’s ability to produce glucose in combination with immunosuppressive therapy to protect the cells.The program has been described as a potential “cure” for type 1 diabetes and comes from research done by Harvard’s Doug Melton. In 2014, Melton published a study showing the potential for using stem cells to create insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells, inserted in bulk into mice, that were successfully protected from an immune response.That led him to launch Semma the next year with a $44 million Series A round, followed by a $114 million Series B in 2017 after his team figured out how to upscale the technology for humans. It involved creating an implantable, credit card-sized device containing the beta cells that function like a healthy pancreas.Melton said at the time that it proved challenging to develop such a membrane with pores large enough for molecules to pass through, but small enough to be protected from immune cells. He compared the membrane to a tea bag that couldn’t be overloaded, given that they would need some 150 million cells in order to provide the natural insulin.All that work led up to two studies that presented promising results in June 2019. In the first study, Semma’s stem cell-derived islets performed as hoped for, producing insulin, in a study involving non-human primates whose immune systems had been flattened to prevent a rejection. Then in a study in two pigs, a package of engineered islets contained in one of the implantable membranes successfully generated insulin without needing an immunosuppressant.About two months later, Vertex swooped in with their buyout offer to gamble on the curative potential on the treatment. It came as part of a string of flashy deals, one that saw the big cap biotech snap up Exonics’ gene editing approach to Duchenne and Ribometrix’s RNA drugging capabilities in 2019 collaborations.Stacked on top of a longtime partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics, Vertex’s dealmaking continued into 2020, leading to a pact with Skyhawk Therapeutics last month. The former had demonstrated landmark data in its sickle cell disease program, while the latter is another RNA drugging outfit.",0.9986

Separately, we are very interested in, and I'm sure others might be interested in understanding the impact of our small molecule correctors on lung function measured by imaging or something like a pulmonary function test, and those are all considerations that we continue to talk and think about. But the framework for our package really is functional AAT levels, antigenic AAT levels and the clearance of the polymers from the liver"".1) As mentioned augmentation therapy already exists. 2) If they were going to attempt to go the augmentation approval endpoint route, FDA would need to see clear benefit of the corrector over that SOC. Personal opinion, I don't see it showing substantiating improvement....why? the corrector by design has to perform multiple biologic complexity's just to turn the protein into what Augmentation therapy already is, a functional protein. Then is it safely correcting enough to be clinically significant. Sure augmentation therapy does nothing for the liver disease, but RNAi does with superb result at this point in time. I am by no means out to trash VRTX here just pointing out it appears their approach to this target is not only not competitive but I am viewing it as a lack of resources and a character flaw to their organization for continuing down this rabbit hole....for what?",0.9983

And that should give them an open door as they hustle through the clinical program.The move comes a little more than 5 months after researchers offered a snapshot look at positive results for the first patient in each of those 2 programs. And it follows close on the heels of an SEC filing noting that researchers here had to stop enrolling new patients due to the Covid-19 outbreak.advertisementIn the program, researchers extract hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from patients and then re-engineer them using CRISPR/Cas9 tech. Those cells are then infused back into patients.At the time, Vertex executive chairman Jeff Leiden heralded the snapshot results as evidence of its “potential to be a curative CRISPR/Cas9-based gene-editing therapy.”",0.9939

Price sponsored or co-sponsored dozens of health-related bills in the House during this time.. .It's legal for members of Congress to trade stocks — but it also introduces legal risks and thorny ethical conundrums, especially if the legislator is writing laws that can influence the sector. “Good judgment would be to stay out of health care stocks if you are on a health-care related committee,” Richard Painter, a former ethics lawyer with the George W. Bush administration and now with the University of Minnesota Law School, tells CQ Roll Call.… The Trump transition team said that, if confirmed, Price would comply with ethics laws that require him to sell his shares in companies that are regulated by HHS or recuse himself from relevant decision-making.Among the stocks that Price has traded: Aetna, Amgen, athenaHealth, Eli Lilly and Pfizer.… The Journal focuses on Price's August 2016 purchase of up to $100,000 in shares of an Australian biomedical firm, Innate Immunotherapeutics Inc. The company's majority shareholder is Rep. Chris Collins, a member of Trump's transition team. The House this year passed the 21st Century Cures bill, a wide-ranging packet of biomedical-related legislation that could benefit firms like Innate. The company's stock price has doubled since Price bought his shares, giving him an on-paper gain of between $50,000 and $100,000.… The issue of lawmakers playing the stock market isn't new, but ethics experts tell PULSE that some trades remain unseemly, especially when legislators are perceived to be profiting through a combination of specialized knowledge and lawmaking ability. One 2004 study found that U.S. senators outperformed the 1990s stock market boom by an average of 12 percentage points.

We expect to initiate Phase 1/2 clinical trials in 2018 to evaluate CTX001, which will be the first, or one of the first, clinical trials to evaluate a potential CRISPR/Cas9 drug candidate. Advanced our research program for alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency into late-stage pre-clinical development Janssen Pharmaceuticals, our collaborator, initiated Phase 3 development of pimodivir as a potential treatment for influenza Successfully outlicensed our oncology programs to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany",0.9979

738,"Reasons To Sell: Trikafta Launch May Cannibalize Sales of Other Drugs: On third/fourth quarter conference call, management said that a large proportion of patients currently on Kalydeco, Orkambi or Symdeko will switch to Trikafta over time. We expect that once Trikafta is fully launched in the United States and EU and gains necessarily reimbursement approvals in EU, there will be a rapid erosion of existing combinations.Also, even if Trikafta is eventually approved in EU in 2020, Vertex would need to seek government reimbursement on a country-by-country basis, in most European markets, which is a time consuming process and may limit ex-U.S. revenues of the drug.Competing Therapies in Development: Several companies like AbbVie, Eloxx Pharmaceuticals, Translate Bio and Proteostasis Therapeutics are developing medicines to treat CF. Even though Vertex enjoys a strong position in this market, the entry of additional competition would cut into revenues.Banking on CF Franchise: Although we are positive on Vertex’s decision to focus on the CF franchise, we remain concerned about the company’s dependence on just this franchise for growth. While the company does have other pipeline candidates targeting other therapeutic areas, it is too early to get excited about them.Pipeline/Regulatory Setbacks: Vertex has several studies ongoing with its CF product candidates and any negative development on the pipeline/regulatory front will have an adverse impact on shares. In October 2017, Vertex announced that it will not file regulatory applications for VX-661 - ivacaftor combination in CF patients with one copy of the F508del mutation and one copy of a gating mutation, as a phase III study evaluating VX-661 — ivacaftor use in such patients failed to meet the primary endpoint.In October 2018, Vertex discontinued development of VX-210 (acute cervical spinal cord injuries) due to futility.",0.994

The study met its primary endpoint of mean absolute within-group change in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) from baseline through 8 weeks of treatment, demonstrating a statistically significant 3.7 percentage point (p<0.0001)improvement in ppFEV1 in patients treated with TRIKAFTA compared to their baseline after a 4-week run-in of treatment on ivacaftor or tezacaftor/ivacaftor. The study met all secondary endpoints, including a statistically significant mean within-group reduction of 22.3 mmol/L from baseline in sweat chloride (p<0.0001). The regimen was generally well-tolerated, and safety data were consistent with those observed in previous Phase 3 studies with TRIKAFTA. The study is a post-marketing commitment in the U.S. and the results will be submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In the U.S., TRIKAFTA is already approved for use in people with CF ages 12 years and older who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation, which includes the populations evaluated in this study. In June, Vertex received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for the initial triple combination regimen application for people with CF ages 12 years and older with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation (F/MF) or two F508del mutations (F/F). Data announced today from this study will be submitted to the European Medicines Agency to support a potential indication expansion of the EU label, once European Commission approval has been granted for the initial triple combination application. Full study results will be submitted for presentation at a future medical meeting and/or publication. “The results of this study demonstrate that the triple combination provides significant additional benefit compared to existing CFTR modulator therapy for F/G and F/RF patients and adds to the robust body of evidence supporting the benefit of this medicine for patients with at least one F508del mutation,” said Carmen Bozic, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer at Vertex. “We look forward to submitting these data to the EMA in support of a potential indication expansion of the EU label following initial approval.” About the 445-104 Study The data announced today are from a global Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TRIKAFTA in people with CF ages 12 years and older who have one copy of the F508del mutation and one gating mutation (F/G), or one copy of the F508del mutation and one residual function mutation (F/RF). All participants had a 4-week run-in period of either ivacaftor or tezacaftor/ivacaftor. Following the run-in, patients were randomized to receive TRIKAFTA or to remain on their prior regimen of ivacaftor or tezacaftor/ivacaftor for 8 weeks. Baseline was measured at the end of the run-in period, prior to the start of the 8-week treatment period. A total of 132 participants received TRIKAFTA and 126 patients were in the control group that received either ivacaftor or tezacaftor/ivacaftor. The primary endpoint of the study, the mean absolute within-group improvement from baseline in ppFEV1 through 8 weeks of treatment with TRIKAFTA, demonstrated a statistically significant improvement of +3.7 percentage points in ppFEV1 (p<0.0001). The study met all secondary endpoints, including, in the order of statistical testing hierarchy, statistically significant mean absolute within-group change in sweat chloride of -22.3 mmol/L (p<0.0001) from baseline through 8 weeks in patients treated with TRIKAFTA, and between-group mean changes of +3.5 percentage points in ppFEV1 (p<0.0001) and -23.1 mmol/L in sweat chloride (p<0.0001) in patients treated with TRIKAFTA compared to the control group of those who received ivacaftor or tezacaftor/ivacaftor.

755,"Third quarter conference call highlights:Q&A were most informative on the progress of the CF franchise pipeline and the business plan for expanding the use of already approved Orkambi and Ivacaftor and hopeful approval of 661 (tezacaftor) next year.Triple therapy clinical trials starting this quarter and in 2017 (and potential quad therapy with EnAc inhibitors from Pharion) discussed in response to analyst questions. Clearly next generation correctors 440 and 152 entering phase 2 clinical trials this quarter in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor in het min and 508dd mutatations confirm management's optimism about extending Vertex CF treatments to 90% of all CF patients. Concerns about teratogenicity or nausea in 440 and 152 respectively, prompted management to advance a third next gen corrector, 659 into phase 1 clinical trials as well this quarter, with it being only six months behind 440 and 152 in it's development as an alternative drug for triple therapy should the first two next gen correctors have any significant problems in safety or efficacy. Vertex is obviously intent on not losing the CF market to competitors like what happened in hep C. No mention of non CF pipeline progress except the broad comments by Ian Smith about the long term growth of the company including new breakthrough drugs being developed for serious diseases. I expect some detail about the non CF pipeline at JP Morgan investor conference in early January. Investor conference this Thursday at NACF should give more details about the long term efficacy of Orkambi and Kalydeco in the approved CF populations, bolstering it's use by prescribers among CF patients still not yet on treatment specifically. the 2000 508dd CF patients in the US who have still not yet been started on Orkambi, and the ex-US 508dd population awaiting EU Canadian and Australian NHS payment authorization in patients 12 and older. Rapid uptake of Orkambi in 508dd CF children ages 6-11 will be likely in the next two quarters in the US and eventually in the EU after approval likely in 2017. Long term efficacy data to be presented at NACF meeting this week will bolster adherence and refill compliance rates once the word is out that after the initial first one or two months of chest tightness/adverse effects from Orkambi, the majority of patients should get improved quality of life and exercise tolerance, reduced incidence of hospitalizations and incidence of serious pulmonary infections, and hopefully will be proven to slow loss of lung function over time extending life expectancy. I suspect 661/tezacaftor with Ivacaftor will have even better results than Orkambi in terms of both efficacy and initial pulmonary side effects.Phase 2 clinical trial triple therapy in the Het min patients due out second half of 2017 will become the next major catalyst for Vertex.

854,"Thanks to Reykus 1. As you know, Vertex claims to have a 'small' setback: the FDA wants to see Phase 1 and Phase 2 monotherapy with the main component VX-561 from their CF-triple, once a day. VX-561 is the deuterated version of ivacaftor (brand name Kalydeco). Some commentators from the biotech world see this as an indication that at least an equally large delay will occur in the clinical trials of competitors of Vertex, in particular Galapagos. The FDA will also have to be so strict for others. 2. The Falcon study conducted exclusively by Galapagos in Europe is explicitly mentioned in this context. In this trial potentiator GLPG2451, C1-corrector GLPG2222 and C2-corrector GLPG2737 are tested. Given the limited size of the cohorts, this should never be the prelude to the necessarily much larger phase 3 trial. The FDA should not grant permission for this, no matter what the results may be, due to lack of statistical relevance. Also previous CF trials of Galapagos would include too few patients. 3. Vertex purchased the CFTR-potentiator CTP-656 in 2017 through an 'asset purchase agreement' from Concert Pharmaceuticals and renamed VTX-561. The deuterated molecule would be slowly metabolized in the liver and therefore ideally suited for once-daily administration, where ivacaftor itself must be administered twice a day. Concert reported on the properties: In a Phase 1 cross-over comparison of CTP-656 and Kalydeco, CTP-656 demonstrated a superior pharmacokinetic profile compared to Kalydeco including a reduced rate of clearance, longer half-life, substantially increased exposure and greater plasma levels at 24 hours. 4. Vertex had previously made the necessary attempts to find a superior potentiometer to be dosed once a day, but did not succeed sufficiently. This is evident simply from the fact that one has chosen - through the purchase of VTX-659 - for the 'quasi conversion' of ivacaftor, a molecule that undoubtedly has obvious, useful clinical properties, but has such a short half-life that twice a day dosing is inevitable. Vertex did not carry out any phase 1 and / or phase 2 research with VX-561 on a stand-alone basis. However, phase 2 studies have been done. This involved an investigation in combination with VX-659 and tezacaftor and one with VX-445 and tezacaftor. 5. Vertex may have hoped that FDA would not require a 'classic' PK / PD and dosing study for the deuterated molecule, but that a simple translation of the ivacaftor data would suffice. In my opinion, that was hoping against better knowledge. I take it for granted that the FDA regards VX-561 as a new chemical entity and wants to know what this molecule performs in a monotherapy and especially how it should be dosed. This requires extensive PK / PD research. Mind you, to my best knowledge, a never-deuterated molecule has been admitted to the market. Logical that the FDA does not want to go ice overnight. Some draw the far-reaching conclusion that competitors of Vertex can not just bring triples to phase 3 without extensive phase 1/2 monotherapy research. Among other things, it is explicitly suggested that the individual components of the Galapagos triple combination therapy have not been adequately studied. 6. In my opinion, two things are mixed up here. Firstly, Vertex's VX-561 is seen by the FDA as an NCE (New Chemical Entity) and must be treated as such, ie in any case phase 1 and (possibly limited) phase 2 research. Secondly: Galapagos has never had any reason or reason to treat their CF molecules as if they were not NCEs.",0.9994

904,"Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ARWR) today presented preclinical data at the 2019 North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference (NACFC) on ARO-ENaC, an inhaled RNAi therapeutic being developed as a potential treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF), which is a rare disease caused by genetic mutations that lead to mucus buildup in the lungs and pancreas. Arrowhead is currently conducting IND/CTA-enabling studies to support regulatory filings in the first half of 2020 for first-in-human studies.Bruce Given, M.D., chief operating officer and head of R&D at Arrowhead, said: “We view the epithelial sodium channel, ENaC, as an exciting target in the treatment of CF and one that is well suited to an RNAi-based intervention. Based on its mechanism of action, ARO-ENaC has the potential to provide clinical benefit to all patients with CF, regardless of genotype, and may prove useful in combination with existing or new CFTR-targeted therapies. The data presented today show that ARO-ENaC can accelerate mucociliary clearance in normal sheep and also preserve airway physiology in a sheep disease model of impaired mucociliary clearance. In addition, animal models indicate that ARO-ENaC can reduce ENaC activity in the lung but avoid impact in the kidney, which has historically been a key safety liability for prior investigational small molecule ENaC inhibitors.”ARO-ENaC is designed to reduce production of the epithelial sodium channel alpha subunit (αENaC) in the airways of the lung. In patients with CF, increased ENaC activity contributes to airway dehydration and reduced mucociliary transport. In CF lung disease, patients can have difficulty breathing and experience frequent and persistent lung infections. Various human genetic studies have validated ENaC as a potential therapeutic target for CF, but the development of inhaled small molecule ENaC inhibitors has been limited by on-target renal toxicity and short duration of action in the lung.Key points presented at NACFC 2019 include the following:Arrowhead's pulmonary epithelial TRiM-enabled delivery platform increased potency of RNAi trigger-mediated silencing of αENaC mRNA, and durably reduced whole lung gene expression in rodentsIn normal sheep, inhaled ARO-ENaC produced dose-dependent acceleration of mucociliary clearance, which is a lung physiology endpoint linked to pulmonary function in patients with CFInhaled ARO-ENaC preserves lung clearance in a sheep disease model of mucostasisARO-ENaC may offer a new renal-sparing, genotype-agnostic therapy for all patients with CF, and exhibiting the potential for an extended duration of action that should minimize treatment burdenArrowhead is also expanding its pulmonary delivery platform to address additional lung disease targets, particularly those that are inaccessible to traditional small molecule or antibody approachesA copy of the poster presentation can be accessed on the Events and Presentations page under the Investors section of the Arrowhead website.",0.9965

The goal of PRIME is to help patients benefit as early as possible from innovative new therapies that have demonstrated the potential to significantly address an unmet medical need. PRIME designation was granted based on clinical data from CRISPR and Vertex’s ongoing Phase 1/2 trial of CTX001 in patients with severe SCD.About CTX001CTX001 is an investigational, autologous, ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy that is being evaluated for patients suffering from transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT) or severe SCD, in which a patient’s hematopoietic stem cells are engineered to produce high levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF; hemoglobin F) in red blood cells. HbF is a form of the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin that is naturally present at birth, which then switches to the adult form of hemoglobin. The elevation of HbF by CTX001 has the potential to alleviate transfusion requirements for TDT patients and reduce painful and debilitating sickle crises for SCD patients.Based on progress in this program to date, CTX001 has been granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT), Fast Track, and Orphan Drug designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Orphan Drug Designation from the European Commission, for both TDT and SCD.CTX001 is being developed under a co-development and co-commercialization agreement between CRISPR Therapeutics ( CRSP ) and Vertex. CTX001 is the most advanced gene-editing approach in development for TDT and SCD.About CLIMB-111The ongoing Phase 1/2 open-label trial, CLIMB-Thal-111, is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of CTX001 in patients ages 12 to 35 with TDT. The trial will enroll up to 45 patients and follow patients for approximately two years after infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in a long-term follow-up trial.About CLIMB-121The ongoing Phase 1/2 open-label trial, CLIMB-SCD-121, is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of CTX001 in patients ages 12 to 35 with severe SCD. The trial will enroll up to 45 patients and follow patients for approximately two years after infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in a long-term follow-up trial.About the Gene-Editing Process in These TrialsPatients who enroll in these trials will have their own hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells collected from peripheral blood. The patient’s cells will be edited using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The edited cells, CTX001, will then be infused back into the patient as part of a stem cell transplant, a process which involves, among other things, a patient being treated with myeloablative busulfan conditioning. Patients undergoing stem cell transplants may also encounter side effects (ranging from mild to severe) that are unrelated to the administration of CTX001. Patients will initially be monitored to determine when the edited cells begin to produce mature blood cells, a process known as engraftment. After engraftment, patients will continue to be monitored to track the impact of CTX001 on multiple measures of disease and for safety.About the CRISPR-Vertex CollaborationCRISPR Therapeutics ( CRSP ) and Vertex entered into a strategic research collaboration in 2015 focused on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to discover and develop potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human disease. CTX001 represents the first treatment to emerge from the joint research program. CRISPR Therapeutics ( CRSP ) and Vertex will jointly develop and commercialize CTX001 and equally share all research and development costs and profits worldwide.",0.9991

I was reading the 4 principle metricts that he stated in the Jan earnings report. The third one was:""Third, we're only interested in discovering and developing transformative medicines for serious specialty diseases. Taken together, we believe this will allow us to identify rapid paths for clinical trials and registration just as we have in CF.""One wonders if such a concentration (in transformative medicines for specialty diseases) at the expense of highly used drugs for some of the common diseases that work better than the present ones would not be something VRTX should be aiming at.

This d-Ivacaftor is being tested with VX-445 (+Tez) and VX-659 (+Tex) in triple combos. It is noteworthy that the dosage used for d-Iva is only 50 mg while Kalydeco used in the same trials is 150 mg of Iva. This indicates that Vertex developers are confident that 50 mg of d-Iva (=VX-561) is at least as good as 150 mg of Iva (=Kalydeco) in efficacy and safety. I would say VX-561 is a second generation Kalydeco. It will be certainly safer than Kalydeco.",0.9405

The revenue from Tez/Iva also increases from the higher price (180K) of the combo and increase of 508 CFer staying on the drug (safer and 20% higher in the 1st year of launch). The expenditure will be about 1.5 B. 10% of the remaining 1.4 B would go to the CF Foundation. The earning per share is 1400 M X 0.9 / 260 M = $4.85, assuming the share number increases to 260 M. Because the development of 2nd gen correctors, one can give a P/E of 35. Then you get the share price of $170 three years from now. However, I suspect that the averaged rev from Tez/Iva would be much higher than 180K assumed above.If VX-440 is safe and effective as predicted from in vitro measurement and Phase 1, then the triple would be approved five years from now. A revenue of greater than 4 B is possible and share price much greater than 200 is likely.",0.995

In these Phase II studies, mean absolute improvements in ppFEV1 of 11.7 and 12.2 percentage points from baseline through week 4 of treatment were observed for the VX-445 and VX-659 triple combination regimens, respectively.The once-daily triple combination regimens were generally well tolerated, and the safety results were consistent with what we have observed in triple combination studies that included ivacaftor. While we believe that the results clearly support the hypothesis that VX-561 has a role in future once-daily triple combinations, the FDA has requested additional dose ranging for VX-561 including potential evaluations of monotherapy before allowing evaluation of VX-561 in late-stage development. We look forward to updating you on our progress with our triple combination regimens as we advance these programs.""So they have done phase 2 with VX-561 and the results are great. However, the FDA is considering 561as a new molecule, even though it is a slightly modified version of Kalydeco and they want a mono trial for its safety which should not take too long to do.

While management points out this includes new initiations as well as those patients transitioning from other Vertex therapies, we believe such transitions are not detrimental to the platform's overall commercial momentum. Most importantly, we point out this traction has occurred despite the larger context of the global COVID-19 pandemic, with management emphasizing an absence of impact on supply chain continuity. While we further discuss pipeline impact below, including paused screening and enrollment, we note key expansion opportunities in CF continue forward, specifically including: (1) ongoing review for triple combination approval in the EU for patients age 12 and older with at least one F508del mutation; (2) planned triple combination sNDA submission to the FDA in 2H20 for children ages 6-11 years old with at least one F508del mutation, pending readout from the fully enrolled Phase 3 trial, which we note could potentially address earlier stages of disease development; and (3) recent Kalydeco submissions for approval in infants ages 4 to less than 6 months old in both the U.S. and Europe, which we note would build upon its current approval in infants age 6 months.""",0.9939

Final data announced today from a 24-week Phase 3 study in people with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation and from a 4-week Phase 3 study in people with two F508del mutations will form the basis of these submissions. Vertex previously announced that both of these Phase 3 studies met their primary endpoints, and the company today announced the final results of these studies, including results for key secondary endpoints and safety data.In each study, treatment with the VX-445 triple combination regimen resulted in statistically significant improvements in all key secondary endpoints. Data from the 24-week study in people with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation showed a mean absolute improvement in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1) of 14.3 percentage points from baseline (p<0.0001) and a 63% reduction in the annualized rate of pulmonary exacerbations (p<0.0001) through week 24 in patients who received the VX-445 triple combination regimen compared to those who received triple placebo. The VX-445 triple combination regimen was generally well tolerated across the two Phase 3 studies. In the study in people with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation, 2 and 0 patients, respectively, who received the VX-445 triple combination or triple placebo discontinued treatment due to adverse events. There were no discontinuations for adverse events in either arm of the study in people with two F508del mutations.Vertex plans to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the third quarter of 2019 and a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the fourth quarter of 2019 based on these data in people with CF ages 12 years and older who have one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation and in people with two F508del mutations.“The substantial improvements in lung function and other measures of CF seen in these Phase 3 studies are unprecedented and represent a defining moment in the journey to provide medicines that treat the underlying cause of CF to the vast majority of people with CF,” said Steven M. Rowe, M.D., M.S.P.H., Director of the Gregory Fleming James Cystic Fibrosis Research Center, University of Alabama at Birmingham and co-chair of Vertex's Triple Combination Steering Committee.“People with CF who have one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation are the largest remaining group of CF patients without a treatment option for the underlying cause of their disease. The final Phase 3 data announced today represent a significant step toward bringing a disease modifying medicine to these patients, as well as toward providing significantly enhanced benefits to patients with two F508del mutations,” said Reshma Kewalramani, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer at Vertex. “We could not have achieved this important milestone without the support of the entire CF community, and we are particularly grateful to those who participated in the triple combination clinical trials.

However, the current valuation assumes that the earnings growth rate of only 35% annually; P/E = 180 / (1.3 X 4) = 35.Yesterday(2/6) Maxim Group downgraded VRTX on the basis of valuation. Let us see whether they are right. I’ll estimate the forward-looking revenue, earnings, and approximate share price at the end of 2021 after one year following a triple combo launch. An approximate revenue is the algebraic product of CF drug prices and number of people taking them; 193 K X 75 K X 0.9 X 0.5 = 6,514 MM.The drug price 193 K was calculated from the averaged current revenue from all three CF drugs assuming that the triple combo will be priced at the average price of current drugs. The 2018 Q4 revenue from CF drugs was 868 MM and the number of people taking the drugs was 18 K. So, the average revenue per person was: 868 MM X 4 / 18 K = 193 K. This is a good averaged effective price for the drugs; the prices in the US would be higher than other regions.The number of people taking them is computed by multiplying potential CFers 75 K X 90% times the fraction of people actually taking the drugs 50%. This figure 50% would be conservative considering the enthusiasm for the triples and Kalydeco.To compute the approximate earnings and share price, we need to estimate the expenditure. The current cost for R&D + SG&A is 1.97 B, but the annual increase for the cost is 0.15 B. I would say that the cost three years from now would be 2.4 B. We have to subtract the 10% royalty to the CF Foundation and the income tax which I would conservatively assume a 30%. (6.51 B – 2.4 B) X 0.9 X 0.7 = 2.59 BSo, the earnings per share would be assuming the share number increases to 270 MM: 2.59 B / 270 MM = $ 9.6If the pain medication and AAT programs go successfully, we may have to give a P/E of 50 or greater. Then, we may see a price near 500. This estimate does not take into account a possible success of gene-editing programs.",0.9957

1235,"https://www.barrons.com/articles/drug-price-legislation-2020-election-trump-senate-house-pelosi-51569417617?mod=hp_LEAD_2[[ With the 2020 election ticking closer and an impeachment process likely to suck up the remaining oxygen in Washington in the coming months, experts say time may have run out for drug-price legislation.Worries about federal government efforts to place limits on drug prices have depressed biotech and pharmaceutical stocks in recent months, as President Donald Trump and the Democrats have been in rare accord in supporting limits on drug prices.Despite a handful of proposals on the table, though, the time to get a bill through before the 2020 election may have passed.“There is a lot of industry spin around this right now, but that notwithstanding, it is very unlikely were are going to see major legislation go through” in the near term, said Dan Mendelson, founder of Avalere Health, a health-care consulting firm, and a former official in the Office of Management and Budget during the Clinton administration.In a note out Wednesday morning, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams also wrote that significant near-term policy changes seem unlikely, citing an interview with an unnamed health-care policy expert.“Too little, too late, for federal [government] action,” Abrahams wrote. “With the general election little more than a year away and other items on politicians’ agendas, [our expert] expects parties to focus more on optics than on effecting real changes.”Various proposals to limit drug prices have been put forward in recent months, including one from the Senate Finance Committee and one from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. President Trump has also pushed the issue. The S&P 500 Pharmaceuticals, Biotech & Life Sciences industry group is down 6.1% over the past 12 months, while the broader S&P 500 is up 2.4%. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (ticker: IBB) is down 15% over the same period, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 1.8%.Drug companies have been fighting the pricing legislation, as The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, with industry trade groups spending millions on ads opposing various legislative and regulatory efforts.Their efforts may be working. In his note, Abrahams wrote that significant policy changes were unlikely in the near term.Of the Senate Finance Committee bill, which Abrahams characterizes as “moderate,” he said that Senate Republicans oppose some aspects. “As such, short of a push by President Trump...it appears unlikely that Sen. Majority Leader McConnell would risk the potential embarrassment of bringing a bill, which would require substantial fleshing out and revision anyway, to a vote.”The Pelosi bill, Abrahams said, will likely pass the House, but fail to pass the Republican-controlled Senate. And while Trump has pressed the drug-price issue, Abrahams said the president is unlikely to place it “at the top of his agenda.”“While our [expert] felt given his predilection for negotiations President Trump may actually be inclined to support Pelosi’s House bill, given the optics around cooperation—especially now, in our view, with an impeachment investigation initiated—we believe this potentially highest-risk scenario for drugmakers is very unrealistic,” Abrahams wrote.Mendelson said that Democrats likely don’t want the drug-price issue resolved before the election. “I think that given the differences in the views of the [Democratic] caucus right now...I don’t see them coming to a full consensus on a bill.”He said some minor near-term changes were possible, such as a restructuring of Medicare Part D that would lower copays—a measure supported by drug companies. “That would be less about drug pricing and more about affordability for seniors,” he said.With near-term pressure relieved, the focus will turn to the postelection outlook. Members of both parties, in debates and policy discussions, highlight the issue as urgent, and many of the candidates would likely push for legislation if elected.”The central issue is affordability,” Mendelson said. “And they are not going to solve that before the 2020 election.”]]",0.9894

1245,"Updates by QdelfanA superb analysis of current status by Qdelfan. It was hidden in this new Yahoo board ""replies"". I take the liberty to bring it up. Glad to connect again with the 'old' VRTX chat board regulars despite what Yahoo has done to it's old discussion board format. I agree the data readout has been so slow, stoking concern by some investors voiced at the Leerink investor conference that the delay implied some kind of problem with second generation corrector candidates in Phase 1 clinical trials. Ian Smith's answer which was basically, ""We'll let you know in a press release when we have finished analysis of the data""(for the two candidates being tested over the past year in phase one trials to use in combination with VX 661 and Ivacaftor for possible treatment of the most difficult to treat CF mutations in a triple drug treatment regimen). I speculate that the fact there are two candidates to choose from creates a challenge for management to choose which of the two should be advanced to phase 2 trials to keep R&D costs down. ie they need to pick wisely in terms of likelihood of clinical efficacy and safety (The challenge being if the data is not that much different between the two choices slight theoretical difference need to be discerned based on the clinical and in vitro trials and then make one's best educated choice between the two and that is a time consuming process). I believe it's likely that we will hear about their final choice and the initiation of 3 drug clinical trials by the end of the month at either the 3rd quarter conference call or at an investor conference at the NACF meeting occurring the same week.I am hopeful that the phase 3 trial data for 661 and ivacaftor will yield superior results to Orkambi, allowing those patients not tolerating or benefiting sufficiently from Orkambi, a better alternative. Hopefully the non-CF drug candidates will get some announcements about their clinical trial progress as well, and a timeline as to when we can expect to hear about their prospects for advancing them into pivotal clinical trials which will likely add value to the company's stock price in the eyes of the analysts. My other observation that I speculate is hopeful, is that except for Josh Boger, there has been very little insider selling of stock options throughout the year as the biotech stocks have been taken down because of the political rhetoric of the presidential election. To me that suggests confidence by insiders about the growth prospects for Vertex. I suspect the fears over pricing are overblown for breakthrough drugs treating orphan diseases, and after the election the inherent value of the drugs will continue to be the predominant mechanism to establish prices for new drugs, and only price raises for older established and generic drugs that have already recouped their R&D investment by pharmaceutical companies will be the focus of any attempts at price controls (and a republican house majority will likely even slow that process). Here's to hoping for a better 2017, and I hope to hear your assessment of the data after the clinical trial data release I expect at the end of this month. Q",0.9993

1272,"You may be wondering how a new triple can beneficially treat 90% of all CF patients. Vertex uses the number 68K for the target population. 68K is indeed 90% of 75K which are all CF patients in the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia (if you include Latin America, more than 75K).CF is a recessive disease. By that, both alleles (remember that there are a pair of chromosomes) of CFTR gene must have mutation to have CF symptoms. All CF patients who have 508 mutation at least in one allele of CFTR gene (and another mutation in the other allele) constitute 70% of all in the major markets excluding Latin America. So, the chance that a CF patient has a 508 mutation in one allele of CFTR is 0.70. Then, the chance of a CFer to have 508 mutation in both alleles (= homozygous 508 CF) is 0.7 X 0.7 = 0.49. This means that the homozygous 508 patients constitute 49% of all CFers. They can benefit from Orkambi, Tez/Iva, or by any of triples.The chance of a CFer to have a heterozygous 508 mutation (508 in one allele, but another mutation on the other allele) is 2 X 0.7 X (1 - 0.7) = 2 X 0.7 X 0.3 = 0.42. ""2"" in front comes from the fact that there are two alleles; allele 1 can have 508 and the other has another, and allele 2 has 508 and the allele 1 has the other mutation. This means that 42% of all CF patients have heterozygous 508 mutation. Therefore, 49% + 42% = 91% of all CF patients are either homozygous or heterozygous 508 patients. All of them can benefit from a tripleHowever, not all of them NEED a triple. More than 10% of CF patients can get by with Ivacafter or with Tez/Iva.

Now this is just from the DARWIN 1, 2, and 3 extension studies, where we have about 1,700 patient years of exposure, but that rate was very low, only one patient in that presentation who had both a DVT and a PE. So the rate actually in that presentation was 0.06 per 100 patient years. But, Geoff, so far we've got thousands of patients in Phase 3. We've got a relatively small data set in terms of exposure, but that's what we have said so far. We continue to collect all of that information. The other point to raise about this was the discussion recently at the Advisory Committee and whether this is slightly or partly related to JAK-2. As you know, filgotinib is very selective for JAK-1. And in terms of JAK-2 specificity, we don't have that at all. So we don't see any changes in hemoglobin. When we see positive changes in hemoglobin, we don't see any increase in platelets. In fact, we see a small decrease in platelets. Whether or not that's related to thromboembolic phenomena, we don't know. And then I believe our fledgling programs that are now developing in full force in inflammation, with filgotinib in multiple diseases are becoming differentiated, exciting, and heading in the right direction, particularly with things such as the Verily collaboration.",0.9866

Yee"" Vertex (VRTX): Phase III Triple at High-end of Expectations and is Important De-risking EventRating BUYPrice Target $210.00Price $167.40Bloomberg NASDAQ: VRTXKey TakeawayPhase III triple data looks strong on efficacy and we expect the stock to bounce back up as the de-risking event removes a downside risk scenario.VRTX stock has been down recently along with the broader market as people trimmed going into the Phase III readout which had high expectations. To be clear, the study was generally already expected to be positive and in the current market environment investors felt there was a high bar to impress. Today, VRTX met or exceeded that high bar and matched the high-end of efficacy expectations, and since the stock has been down in front of it, we think it will bounce back, setting the course and pace to perhaps triple or quadruple earnings power over the next five years. VRTX is the only big growth story in large-cap biotech, making it a scarce equity and a name we recommend investors own in the current environment, given no major generic or biosimilar risks like some of its peers.Phase III in the all-important het-min (heterozygous) study showed positive stat sig (p<0.0001) FEV1 improvement of +14% vs pbo (+13% drug vs -1% pbo). This is the high end of the efficacy range of results that were shown in Phase II (e.g. 9%-14% amongst the various triples). No safety details were disclosed as the study remains ongoing for longer-term follow-up, but we believe results are likely clean enough in the big picture and are not concerned about this. '659 was also the one that had a relatively clean and pristine safety/tolerability profile in Phase II versus '445 triplet which had a billirubin case and more ALT increases. Phase III results for '445 will read out in Q1:19, and the study has completed enrollment and is yet another shot on goal that will likely have similar efficacy and perhaps relatively similar safety profile. Note today's '659 data appear to have a cleaner safety profile with similar efficacy and slightly better sweat chloride data than '445, so we predict this is probably the one they take forward - if we had to guess.In homozygous which is a market already well penetrated by Orkambi and Symdeko, this triple of '659 is meant to significantly improve FEV efficacy from a current +4% to +14%, which is a huge improvement and benefit for patients and will eventually replace Orkambi/Symdeko over time and creates a huge barrier to entry given the overall efficacy/safety profile of '659 in this population. The Phase III data today showed +10% added efficacy over the doublet alone (Symdeko). Thus, this yields a total +14% for the overall triple in homozygous patients. Note other competitors such as PTI are trying to show some triple data in homozygous patients, and the bar is fairly high, given VRTX is significantly years ahead in development and shows pristine safety profile and high +14% efficacy.The bear case is today's positive data was generally expected (but it is a de-risking event) and PTI (small market cap of $270M) will have preliminary data in Q4 on their proprietary triple using a slightly different mechanism of an amplifier. That company filed a shelf this week as well. Again, we think the bar is pretty high for PTI although investors point to +6% efficacy (+8% vs pbo) with their doublet in a small number of patients, which is modestly better than Orkambi/ Symdeko but arguably not clinically meaningful and the bar is very high for the triple to ultimately get to +14%",0.999

With its hepatitis-C business slowing, Gilead ""needs a transformational acquisition soon to prop up its falling revenue and growth outlook,"" claim Leerink's Geoffrey Porges and Bradley Canino. They explain why Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) makes the perfect target for Gilead: In our view, VRTX’s rare-disease portfolio and robust pipeline would satisfy all the critical attributes for a meaningful acquisition for Gilead - Shortage, Size, Security and Synergy. Gilead currently has ~$32bn in cash and a leverage ratio of ~1.2x, suggesting that the company has the potential to comfortably make a transformative acquisition such as Vertex. Our preliminary merger analysis indicates that an acquisition of VRTX in the range of typical premia of 20-40% ($153-178/share) would prove to be meaningfully accretive to Gilead in the long run with an internal rate of return of ~8-10% for Gilead’s shareholders.Shares of Gilead Sciences are little changed at $70.85 at 9:33 a.m. this morning, while Vertex Pharmaceuticals has gained 1.9% to $129.61.

Her success in these activities, rather than in clinical development, will determine whether Vertex has another phase of growth in its future….Vertex suggested to us that Dr Kewalramani has built strong relationships inside the company during her relatively short tenure at the company, and she brings to the position the physician-scientist profile that the company was seeking during its search for Leiden’s successor.

(US only as of 2017) --> double that to conservatively project worldwide patient poolDMD incidence is estimated at around 1/40002017 rev: ~$160m (projected)2018 rev: ~$368m (projected per RBC - do not believe this accounts for any EU revs - pending approval)2017 MC (as of 10/27/17): $3.06bEOY 2018? potential accelerated approval (US) for Golodirsen (x53)Would add an additional 8% of DMD population to patient poolCasimersen (x45) would add another 8%Further exons in developmentNext gen PPMO set to enter clinic by EOY '172 gene therapies set to enter clinic by EOY '17This is all very high level and admittedly roughly/quickly researched with no claims of 100% accuracy but I think it highlights how currently under-valued I feel SRPT is. While CF has roughly 2x the patient population as DMD I feel like SRPT pipeline is much more advanced at this point in time than VRTX was even 3 years into the launch of Kalydeco.

1464,"https://www.barrons.com/articles/mrna-is-the-next-frontier-in-treating-disease-but-will-it-work-51567205845?mod=hp_HEROThis weekend's Barrons Cover Story presents current status of mRNA therapy pursued by Vertex/Moderna collaboration and a serious competitor Translate Bio. For people who do not subscribe Barrons I quote a few passages from the Cover Story.[[Last year, one gene-therapy pioneer resigned from the scientific advisory board of a company over concerns about the risks posed by high doses of the virus used to deliver gene therapies. Other scientists have debated whether that virus could inadvertently integrate its own DNA into a patient’s chromosome, causing cancer.Some experts say these fears leave mRNA looking like a safer option. If a gene therapy goes wrong, there is no turning it off; mRNA, on the other hand, is dosed like a normal drug, so it can be stopped if it causes side effects. Plus, mRNA stays out of the nucleus, reducing the risk of accidental integration.“It is transient, which should clearly be safer,” said Philip Santangelo, a professor in the department of biomedical engineering at Georgia Tech who has received research grants from two of the mRNA companies. “It is easier to deliver than DNA, in many respects, because it only has to get to the cytosol,” or main body of the cell, and not into the nucleus itself.]]...[[ The Translate drug now in multiple-dose trials treats cystic fibrosis, a debilitating genetic lung disease. In late July, the company released data on the single-dose portion of the same trial. Analysts said the results were promising, but the stock fell 11% on the day of the release.]]The data showed a poor dose-response at best. Open the link below and read FEV1 changes at 24 mg dose vs. 8 mg dose.https://investors.translate.bio/news-releases/news-release-details/translate-bio-announces-interim-results-phase-12-clinical-trial[[“It is encouraging, but early,” said Josh Schimmer, an analyst who covers the stock for Evercore ISI. “Ultimately, more data are going to be required to discern how much of this was signal, how much of this was noise.” Translate said it will release results from the multidose portion of the trial next year, and will present some additional safety data on the single ascending dose portion of the trial at a cystic fibrosis conference that starts in late October.One of the reasons that investors like the mRNA companies is that the biological mechanisms they are targeting are generally well understood. The question around Translate’s cystic fibrosis drug, for example, isn’t whether it is instructing lung cells to make the correct protein, but rather whether it can make enough of the protein, and if it can do so safely.That thinking is key to Moderna’s strategy. If the science shows that what the drugs are trying to do should work, then maybe all it takes to get a result is to try it again and again.“There are so many shots on goal,” said Edward Tenthoff, an analyst who covers the stock for Piper Jaffray.Moderna is taking those shots from a factory in Norwood, Mass., where, in December 1994, Polaroid built its 150 millionth instant camera. Today, the facility is the showpiece of Moderna, which raised $604 million from its initial public offering late last year. Moderna’s framing of the outlook for mRNA therapies is binary: It is going to be huge, or it is going to be nothing.Company executives, needless to say, are banking on the former.“There’s no scientifically plausible way where this entire technology will only yield one drug or one vaccine,” said Tal Zaks, the company’s Israel-born chief medical officer, sitting in his small office in Cambridge, Mass. “It just doesn’t make sense. If it works for an application like a vaccine, it should work for more than one. That was what got all of us who joined here really excited.”In 2016, the health-care news organization STAT reported that a “caustic work environment” at Moderna had “driven away top talent.” The company’s CEO, Stéphane Bancel, had built a “culture of recrimination,” and a large number of senior executives had left, according to the report.At the time, Bancel acknowledged that the company had been an “intense place,” but said he had worked to address the criticisms of his leadership. Moderna now said that its turnover over the past 12 months is below the industry average, citing external data.Those concerns didn’t keep the company from attaining a market value of $6.1 billon after its first day as a public company, in December 2018. After a selloff, the company now has a market capitalization of $5 billion, with cash and investments worth a total of $1.4 billion. Moderna reported quarterly revenue of $13.1 million in early August, and a net loss for the quarter of $135.1 million.Without earnings, its valuation is difficult to measure, but Wall Street analysts have set an average price target of $30.25 on the stock, according to FactSet, ...]]",0.999

We expect to obtain clinical data from our AAT program in people with two Z mutations in 2020.And consistent with our approach of developing a portfolio of multiple potential medicines in each of our programs, we have also recently advanced a second AAT corrector, VX-864 into Phase I development; both VX-814 and VX-864 have received Fast-Track Designation from the FDA.In pain, we have established proof-of-concept for NaV1.8 inhibition in multiple Phase II studies in acute, neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain conditions. We have identified a number of selective NaV1.8 inhibitors and our plan is to obtain clinical data from multiple compounds in order to choose the best molecule or molecules to advance into late-stage developments.

Analyst Brian Abrahams believes that the current stock price has more than 20% upside potential in the near term and the long term growth outlook of the company is even more impressive.

1558,"With GLPG2222, 2737 and 2451, for example, regular phase 1 research in healthy volunteers was done separately and in combination, followed by follow-up research in patients. For example, the annoying metabolite of GLPG2451 (half-life one month) was discovered, which of course led to extra research. The C1-corrector GLPG2222 has meanwhile been investigated as monotherapy (in homozygous Class II F508del CF patients) • With the C2-corrector GLPG2737 has been tested in combination with Orkambi (also in homozygous CF patients). GLPG2451 is being investigated in the recently started Falcon study in part 1 in combination with C1-corrector GLPG2222, before being used as the basic component of the triple in part 2. Finally, a complete phase 2 study is performed with all three components. The two-step approach makes it possible to determine the merits of the C2 corrector by comparing part 1 with part 2. 7. Of course, critical followers are free to doubt the statistical evidence of the studies of Galapagos, especially where the quality of the 'dose ranging' part. The doubt mainly focuses on the Falcon study with the combination GLPG2451 / 2222/2737. Precisely because it is a combination of three active substances, finding the optimal effective doses with the most favorable side effects profile is not an easy task. In theory, a large number of options must be investigated. Fortunately, the state of clinical statistical research has progressed so far that 'dose ranging' has become almost a separate field of science. The number of options can therefore be greatly reduced. And besides, why would the Galapagos medical statisticians set up a rickety study with the near-certainty of capital destruction. Vertex, on the other hand, has been baffled by the FDA because it has not done any (published) research with the deuterated molecule. Allowing such a (controversial!) Variant to enter the market creates a strong precedent, also in view of the patent-law aspects. The FDA is well aware of that, it seems to me. 8. Meanwhile, we know that Galapagos wants to conduct its Phase 3 research entirely in Europe, thereby circumventing potential problems with the FDA and other major stakeholders in the United States. We do not know what these problems are. One has, among other things, obtained scientific advice in England. Furthermore, no permission is required from EMA - other than from FDA - to initiate phase 3 investigations. National committees in Europe only assess the ethical aspects of the study design. However, the advice of questions and consultations with UK and EMA authorities clearly required a great deal of time. 9. Of course, the USA market is one and a half times as big as the European CF market (mainly due to higher prices in relation to Europe). But a quick admission by EMA / European Commission in combination with the high price sensitivity of the national markets in Europe offers the Galapagos with its triple (s) unprecedented opportunities, now that Vertex is facing a serious delay. In the event of competitive pricing, just about three quarters of the market can be conquered within a few years. Success in Europe will undoubtedly put the FDA under light pressure to decide on quick admission. Perhaps the misunderstanding between the top of Galapagos and AbbVie can be traced back to various insights at the time about the strategy to be pursued: all R & D efforts on the AbbVie home market (and Vertex!) Or the efforts to focus first on the European Union with are more price-sensitive markets of the Member States. 10. I realize that here on the forum all attention goes to the molecules GLPG1690 (IPF) and GLPG1972 (OA). Galapagos itself has also shifted attention and emphasis on both experimental means. However, I was and is of the opinion that progress in the area of CF triples is much more appealing to the imagination among the institutional US investors in particular. The CF market is a well-known, large market with a single monopolist, whose value is well above $ 40 billion. As soon as you get the impression that Vertex is vulnerable, that will give great attention to the Galapagos share. Then the hateful undervaluation of the price may disappear as snow for the spring sun ....",0.9976

Laurence Powell is one such campaigner, calling for access on behalf of his son.LPNick Medhurst, policy manager for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust says the charity and the many CF campaigners feel a renewed sense of optimism about access to what they are sure is a transformative medicine for people with cystic fibrosis.“The news that the parties are sitting down again, and with pronouncements from both the company and the secretary of state that talks have been constructive, makes us optimistic,” he said. “But unfortunately we've been optimistic before, so we won’t count our chickens just yet.”The CF Trust believes that some sort of outcomes-based deal, drawing on its own registry of CF patients, could help unlock a deal. There is extra pressure on NHS England to arrive at a solution after Vertex recently reached agreement with Scotland for access to Orkambi and Symkevi.""",0.9991

It would end drug innovation in the pharmaceutical industry with the risk of drug development costs not being worth the uncertain payoff if drug price controls thwart profits needed to fund the research and pay off those taking the financial risk. Providing health insurance for the uninsured does not require destroying the progress made in medical advances that require an adequate profit to take the financial risk to develop new medical breakthroughs. The success of the medical and pharmaceutical industry provides large numbers of high paying jobs that provide huge tax revenue for states and the federal government. Who is going to make up that tax revenue if many of those jobs disappear with socialized medicine? The overall cost of medicare for all would not be made up for by eliminating the health insurance industry. Medicare for all would then have to become rationed healthcare for all since the budgetary shortfalls would have to be made up for by restricting healthcare. As an example, check out restrictions on treatments in countries like the UK with NHS refusing to pay for most of VRTX CF drugs as an example, even if discounted more than 50%. CF Children's lives in the UK will not be valued more than an additional 10 thousand dollars a year to pay for breakthrough VRTX CFTR corrector drugs based on the NHS most recent offer.

But then again there are those traders on wall street that do things that supposedly make them lots of money. If I just knew their methodology--I could become very rich or very poor. Hummmm,0.8909
