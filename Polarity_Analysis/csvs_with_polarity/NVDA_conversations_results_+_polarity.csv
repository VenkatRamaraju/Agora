510,"Something to read and digest....""The company is set to release the January quarter results today after the bell, and Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann expects Nvidia to post a “beat and raise.”“We see the January quarter being driven by strength in Gaming, Professional Visualization, and a continued recovery in Automotive offset by a sequential decline in Data Center,” the 5-star analyst said. “While the outlook will likely see continued adoption of Ampere and the recently announced Ampere featured laptops, strength in AI and cloud computing verticals, better than expected Gaming, and Automotive growth.”Mosesmann expects sales in the longer 14-week quarter to be above his and the Street’s forecast for low single-digit sequential growth, with EPS also coming in higher than his $2.80 forecast and the consensus estimate of $2.81.Nvidia’s main breadwinner, Gaming, should rise mid-single-digits quarter-over-quarter, driven by “continued ramp of the RTX 30 series, products, work-from-home demand dynamics, and game console SoCs.”Of the company’s fast-growing division, Data Center, the analyst anticipates a cooling off period with a pause to its rally and a sequential low single-digits decline. The outlook for the segment is a key area to watch on the earnings call, where Mosesmann will be keen to learn about the likely duration of supply chain shortages, which the analyst believes will continue beyond F2Q21, and “controls on cryptocurrency mining using GPUs.”Additionally, over the next several quarters, the data processing unit will continue to be a focal point and is noted as another tailwind. All in all, Mosesmann makes no bones about his long-term prospects for the GPU heavyweight.“We see NVDA as the best managed and strategically positioned semiconductor company,” the analyst summed up.""",0.9908

All three models can also be fitted with the hardware required for full self-driving, including lidar sensors, 15 cameras, Nvidia's Drive Orin computer, and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. Vinfast hasn't said when its vehicles will be ready for full self-driving, though....Vinfast's main plant is located in Hai Phong, Vietnam.

It also recently acquired the proving ground of General Motors' former Australian subsidiary, Holden.Unlike other new companies promising to bring EVs to the market, Vinfast has deep pockets. It's part of Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup, which specializes in construction and real estate development but is also involved in agriculture, healthcare, retail, tourism and numerous other sectors.

Even if NVidia just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem.

There are many to choose from.✓ option your stock If you are concerned about capital gains or have chosen to hang on long-term.✓buy the March 29 $50 Puts and close that position at 25% gain before next Friday (control your greed and take your profits even though it will probably double this coming week) You will see a minimum of 25% appreciation in those puts by Tuesday at 10: 45 at latest.This is not a pitch to improve my personal position It is out of concern for those who are too attached to this particular stock and face steep losses.

1495,"As disability awards grow, so do concerns over the veracity of veterans’ PTSD claimsBy Alan ZaremboOctober 16, 2014The 49-year-old veteran explained that he suffered from paranoia in crowds, nightmares and unrelenting flashbacks from the Iraq war. He said he needed his handgun to feel secure and was worried that he would shoot somebody.The symptoms were textbook post-traumatic stress disorder.But Robert Moering, the psychologist conducting the disability examination at a Veterans Affairs hospital in Tampa, Fla., suspected the veteran was exaggerating. Hardly anybody had so many symptoms of PTSD so much of the time.As disability awards for PTSD have grown nearly fivefold over the past 13 years, so have concerns that many veterans might be exaggerating or lying to win benefits. Moering, a former Marine, estimates that roughly half of the veterans he evaluates for the disorder exaggerate or fabricate symptoms.Depending on severity, veterans with PTSD can receive up to $3,000 a month tax-free, making the disorder the biggest contributor to the growth of a disability system in which payments have more than doubled to $49 billion since 2002.“It’s an open secret that a large chunk of patients are flat-out malingering,” said Christopher Frueh, a University of Hawaii psychologist who spent 15 years treating PTSD in the VA system.Diagnosing PTSD can be difficult in the best of circumstances. Experts have long debated how to define the condition. One person can suffer crippling anxiety from an experience that would not faze someone else.Assessing PTSD becomes even more difficult in a VA system that gives veterans a financial incentive to appear as sick as possible, former and current VA mental health clinicians said. The number of veterans on the disability rolls for the disorder has climbed from 133,745 to more than 656,000 over the last 13 years.",0.61

Gaming has become the world's largest media and entertainment industry, and will grow to be much larger. And again gamers will create, will play, they'll learn, they'll connect. The medium of gaming can host any type of game and eventually evolve with the countless metaverses.So I'm for placed on for work. Gaming at simultaneously a great technology and a great business driver for our company. This year, we also closed our Mellanox acquisition and successfully united the amazing talent of our companies. Combined we possess deep expertise in all aspects of computing and networking to drive the architecture of modern data centers. Crowd computing and hyperscalers have transformed the data center into the new unit of computing. Chips on servers are just elements of the data center scale computers now.With our expertise in AI computing full stack accelerated computing, our deep network to computing expertise and cloud to edge platforms, Nvidia is helping to drive a great computer industry transformation. And our planned acquisition of Arm, the world's most popular and energy efficient CPU company will help position and video to lead in the age of AI. This year was extraordinary.The pandemic will pass, but the world has been changed forever. Technology adoption is accelerating across every industry. Companies and products need to be more remote and autonomous. This will drive data centers, AI and robotics. This underlies the accelerated adoption of Nvidia’s technology.

Let's start with Jensen Huang and Nvidia. The quarter just reported was superb, as usual, but the conference call brought out lingering fears of 2018, where Nvidia ended up with some slowing end markets, crypto and data center. The latter soon accelerated, but because of an oddity of not knowing whether its cards were being used in gaming or mining, the company saw an inventory glut when bitcoin crashed.This time around the data center spend is accelerating, because of the move to the cloud, and the company has a real hand on crypto, which could be a good business and Nvidia will have its own Ethereum mining chips that can be monitored. The market was wrong on both counts. Can Nvidia close on the Arm Holdings deal giving it the best full suite of chips for every fast growing market? After doubting Jensen on the ability to close on Mellanox, I am not going to make the same mistake this time around. This stock is way too cheap versus next year's numbers-not this year's-and it's a buy.""",0.9897

Meanwhile, the RTX 2060 launched on the market in early 2019 for $350, but can be found on NewEgg from $800 to $1,644, not exactly an affordable price point for most gamers.New NVIDIA 3000-series GPUs are all but impossible to find, simply because NVIDIA can’t get enough GPUs to keep up with demand.",0.9692

2086,"Qualcomm, Microsoft and Google are being just a LITTLE bit hypocritical. Qualcomm has paid their share of anti-trust fines, and both Microsoft and Google have their history of buying up other companies and trying to crush competition. Aside from pushing AI forward - Nvidia is already a leader in AI without Arm - they'll be competing with Intel. As for Intel, they're getting into graphics cards. Nvidia and Intel are also competing in cloud data. The real battle shaping up here seems to be between Nvidia and Intel.Jensen has said that he would maintain Arm's neutral licensing model. Moreover, not only has he said he would maintain Arm's current operations in the UK, but expand it. The Nvidia website states:""Opening the AI research facility for collaboration with UK industry leaders addressing the world’s most pressing challenges.""""Expanding research partners within the UK through research fellowships and partnerships via the AI research centre.""""Helping UK start-ups grow through access to the Arm supercomputer, NVIDIA experts, technical training and marketing promotion.""Seems pretty clear that he would agree to stipulations that would address most concerns. As for export control, which would be China's concern, Arm CEO Simon Seegar stated that it is ""...governed by where the technology is created in the first place. That doesn't change with the change of ownership of Arm.""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8HTfQi548The US would not be able to restrict China's access to Arm because it is British. In other words, this is a non-issue. The US could ask the UK to restrict Chinese access, but that's politics and could happen with or without the deal. The US and UK are close allies. That is something China will just have to accept.",0.9953

Me, a few years back after downsizing ,and being retired looked around for some good growth stocks to enhance my remaining years found NVDA and a few others. By remaining long with NVDA and its 1,500 shares my profits to date exceed over $700,000. Could I have increased that gain by playing 'shorts'over those few years? I doubt it and the stress and risk of wrong short term decisions over that time would no doubt have destroyed the joy of retirement......better to head to the casino as at least it would have been fun playing. Anyway, longs stay firm as NVDA is a great company with the best products. AMD, had some of their stock but quickly realized that their products, mainly CPU's have become almost obsolete and they have hung on and gained market share only because lousy management by Intel allowed it.

Very important technology and an enormous market that needs this type of continuous monitoring. I was a speaker at a Juvenile Diabetes Medical Meeting in Dallas Tx in 1981 and the physicians were praying for something like the SENS technology to help Diabetics become healthier and safer. Now it is here and with future work to couple the sensors with a pump to deliver the correct amount of insulin you will have the dream that has been the Holy Grail for Diabetic Therapy for 45 years.

2540,"What NVidia really needs to do to accelerate its growth rate and strengthen its technology leadership in the entire tech sector is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for NVidia (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if NVidia just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

The NVIDIA software suite provides scale-out, multi-node, AI application performance on vSphere that is indistinguishable from bare-metal servers.“Until now, the world has run AI on bare-metal servers,” said Justin Boitano, vice president and general manager of Enterprise and Edge Computing at NVIDIA. “NVIDIA AI Enterprise enables customers to reduce AI model development time from 80 weeks to just eight weeks, and allows them to deploy and manage advanced AI applications on VMware vSphere with the same scale-out, record-breaking NVIDIA accelerated computing performance that’s possible on bare metal.”“Every enterprise is exploring how to modernize their infrastructure to meet the demands of AI applications,” said Lee Caswell, vice president of marketing for the Cloud Platform Business Unit at VMware. “With NVIDIA AI Enterprise and vSphere 7 Update 2, VMware customers are now able to fast-track AI in their virtualized data centers and easily deploy certified, AI-ready infrastructure for their modern apps.”Powering Advanced AI at Enterprise ScaleAmong the first to use NVIDIA AI Enterprise for vSphere is Optum Technology, part of UnitedHealth Group.“AI plays an increasingly important role in the data-driven services Optum provides for United Healthcare,” said Justin Potuznik, senior principal engineer at Optum Technology. “With NVIDIA’s AI Enterprise software and infrastructure running on our VMware vSphere environment, we’ll be able to power our modern application workloads and efficiently deploy AI at enterprise scale.”Flexible AI Infrastructure for the Hybrid CloudNVIDIA AI Enterprise provides compatibility for a broad set of accelerated CUDA applications, AI frameworks, pre-trained models and software development kits running in the hybrid cloud. Optimizations enable workloads to scale across multiple nodes to support large deep learning training models with full GPU virtualization.To power the applications in NVIDIA AI Enterprise, VMware vSphere 7 Update 2 is now certified for NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs on NVIDIA-Certified Systems, which include high-volume servers from Dell Technologies, HPE, Lenovo and Supermicro. With this certification comes direct customer support from NVIDIA for vSphere customers that acquire a license for NVIDIA AI Enterprise.NVIDIA has also certified vSphere as the only compute virtualization software to provide hypervisor support for live migration with NVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU technology, which allows each A100 GPU to be partitioned into up to seven instances at the hardware level to maximize efficiency for workloads of all sizes.Additionally, select NVIDIA ConnectX adapters are now certified for VMware vSAN over RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access), which offloads CPU communication tasks to boost application performance and improve infrastructure returns on investment.NVIDIA AI Enterprise is available as a perpetual license at $3,595 per CPU socket. Enterprise Business Standard Support for NVIDIA AI Enterprise is $899 annually per license. Customers can apply for early access to NVIDIA AI Enterprise as they plan their upgrades to VMware vSphere 7 Update 2.For more information on bringing AI to VMware hybrid clouds, read the NVIDIA blog and the VMware vSphere 7 Update 2 release blog. Free registration is now open for GTC 2021, where NVIDIA and VMware will present on bringing AI to every enterprise.",0.9991

I can not believe that something like these days can happen when people are rewarding companies that are not fundamentally sound and punish stocks that are fundamentally sound. I remember when some analysts did that because some did not do their research or wants to promote a stock or were late in getting in but those things did not last because people can see what is wrong and they can tell when things go fishy. I think this thing that is happening now is worse because it involves a lot of people who gang up on few stocks with some using margin to get in and selling stocks like NVDA LRCX KLAC APPL AMD ADBE and most tech stocks like semis cloud and others who have been reporting strong earnings for years and have very little debt and some with no debt.

They have acquired Mellanox and developed the DGX A100 for datacenter that has reduced the costs for major cloud companies by 1/10th while running at 1/20th the power with partners including Microsoft, VMware and Redhat. The Mellanox deal has also allowed Nvidia to offer Cyber Security Solutions and expand their datacenter marketshare. Nvidia has announced over 70 gaming laptops that will use their RTX GPU's in 2021 alone with their RTX 3090 being the most powerful consumer GPU on the planet (the A100 being the most powerful DPU on the planet). Nvidia is attempting to close the deal with ARM that will effectively allow them to ditch AMD and produce their own CPU's for self driving, datacenter, compute and mobile. The deal would bring in some of the most intelligent semiconductor architecture designers on the planet that helped Apple become what it is today back in the Acorn Computers days. Nvidia GPUs are included in 8 of the 10 fastest industrial supercomputers in the world, which speaks to the abilities of Nvidia engineers if the ARM deal falls through. Nvidia is in the Nintendo Switch that sold over 3.3 million units worldwide in the first 11 weeks. Demand due to Covid and the emergence of AI has created the best environment for GPUs on record with the demand to continue for the foreseeable future with supply struggling to keep pace.Bear case: No one in the future is going to drive, use the internet or game because everyone will become Amish.

Still, as expected, the topic of the ongoing shortages of GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3090 models bubbled up during the session. In response to a question about the shortages, Huang countered that the company hadn't experienced a shortage of supply, but rather an abundance of demand:""The 3080 and 3090 have a demand issue, not a supply issue,"" said Huang. ""The demand issue is that it is much much greater than we expected — and we expected really a lot.""""Retailers will tell you they haven't seen a phenomenon like this in over a decade of computing. It hearkens back to the old days of Windows 95 and Pentium when people were just out of their minds to buy this stuff. So this is a phenomenon like we've not seen in a long time, and we just weren't prepared for it.""""Even if we knew about all the demand, I don't think it's possible to have ramped that fast. We're ramping really, really hard. Yields are great, the product's shipping fantastically, it's just getting sold out instantly,"" said Huang.

With more software engineers than hardware engineers on staff, it’s software and ecosystem plays that have really cemented NVIDIA’s position as the top GPU manufacturer, and created a larger market for their GPUs. At the same time, it’s these ecosystem plays that have allowed NVIDIA to build a profit-printing machine, diversifying beyond just GPU sales and moving into systems, software, support, and other avenues.To that end, NVIDIA this morning is formally rolling out a new ecosystem play aimed at high-end deep learning servers, which the company is branding as NVIDIA-Certified Systems. Soft-launched back in the fall, today the company is giving the program a more proper introduction, detailing the program and announcing some of the partners.

The Nasdaq 100 is off 7% from its February 16 high, while the S&P 500 is down 3% over that same time period.The 10-year US Treasury note spiked to a cycle high of more than 1.50% on Thursday, and interest rate volatility saw its biggest spike since March of 2020, as measured by the CBOE Interest Rate Volatility Index.But according to Lee, the volatility in interest rates feels ""capitulatory,"" which could lead to gains ahead for stocks.Lee highlighted that soaring interest rate volatility, coupled with an extended 30-week rate of change, occured on the following dates: June 24, 2013, October 15, 2014, March 19, 2020, and February 24, 2021.What's significant about the first three of these dates is that after each of these instances it marked the bottom in the stock market ""to the day,"" Lee said.

4002,"For those of you not familiar with the chip industry. I’ve seen some posts suggesting Nvidia profits are going to drop with Ethereum 2.0 and EIP 1559 in July. Although both of these will have a large effect on GPU mining it’s true. You’ll see the mining industry start to lose pace this summer as miners sell off their cards before the jacked up prices begin to fall. Nvidia are not the ones making the money on these jacked up prices to begin with.. it’s aftermarket and scalpers. When mining goes away Nvidia GPUs will continue to fly off shelves. Gamers are demanding these cards since they came out. Gaming is also the biggest and fastest growing entertainment industry. Nvidia will have some ups and downs due to being linked with mining but this company will go nowhere but up long term. AMD is still playing catch up in the graphics department. I may not suggest when you should buy this stock but it is a great long term play. I’m a gamer and a miner so take from that what you will. Even with a silicon shortage effecting all businesses this is temporary.. the pandemic has caused a large increase to the gaming community and trust me it isn’t going to fade as things go back to “normal.” If you’re interested in this stock timing could be difficult but there is a ton of upside with their data centres, gaming and the huge possibility of the arm deal closing.",0.9956

We believe that this will help provide more predictable and reliable energy,” said Keith Cockerham, Utilities Industry Lead at NVIDIA. “The combination of Veritone CDI and NVIDIA EGX provides the millisecond-level autonomous decision-making capabilities required for smart grid management and resiliency.”Veritone is focusing their initial NVIDIA migration efforts on energy optimization of complex smart grids, and plan to develop optimized solutions for grid and electric car batteries in the future. For grid batteries, fast and accurate modeling of batteries on NVIDIA EGX are planned to increase battery utilization, reduce the risk of thermal events and extend battery life.

Prices remain high in secondary markets, reportedly double what the company recommends, well over a quarter after the Ampere-based chips became available.As irked as gamers -- or cryptocurrency miners, another group of buyers -- might be by the lack of supply, the surging demand has driven up forecasts for fiscal fourth-quarter sales in Nvidia's videogame segment to $2.39 billion.
