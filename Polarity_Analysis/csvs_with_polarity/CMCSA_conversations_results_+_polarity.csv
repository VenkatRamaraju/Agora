But tonight, REELZ is awful. Tried watching Jailhouse Rock with Elvis, at 5:15 on Saturday evening, and small, repetitive outages. I turned the volume up to listen to Viva Las Vegas moments earlier, but it too had audio problems. Somethings wrong with Comcast. They are cutting power to save money, or they have an rogue employee that I want to do horrible things to, or their feed stinks. Either way, the FCC gives them a license to broadcast, but that could be in trouble, if the FCC knew they charged by the month for access to every channel, then selectively cut power to boost profits. I have called REELZ to tell them they should get their money back from Comcast, and to get Comcast to refund the money they get from advertisers. The next step, if needed, will be to start sending audio of broadcasts to local governments all over their service area. They will be deeply disappointed that franchises they regulate, are not giving what their residents are paying for. Can you imagine the money comcast will have to spend sending people to every community they have customers in, to respond to this complaint..

145, NBC - Yet again more of NBC Trump bashing on nightly Fake News like every night since Trump was elected. I remember all the free passes bias liberal Fake News gave President Obama for 8 years. I remember Obama said ISIS was a JV team and contained one big lie. Not a word about his record deficit spending or the bad deal he made with Iran and giving Iran $Billions$. Then bias Fake News gave Obama and Democrats a free pass on the Nightmare called Obamacare. What a whopper lie Obama and Democrats told us about that. Shame on Fake News outlets NBC-MSNBC- ABC- CBS- CNN. I think 85% of the news by these outlets is bias and a pack of liberal lies. Now many reporters are always wanting guarantees on anything Trump proposes or passes. I never heard News reporters asking that once in 8- years at Obama press conferences. See why I don't buy anything the liberal media puts out on TV anymore. Clean up your act or soon nobody we watch your liberal bias news.,0.8846

After baiting hundreds of thousands of customers into midrange TV plans with popular channels, one by one, they are taking them off the midrange plans, and making it an option or more money to get. IE TMC and Starz. And if you want to downgrade, if you can stomach their sales people, and get them to do what you want, you have to pay a penalty. Isn't it bait and switch ? Shouldn't the price of the plan be reduced when the best content is removed, and some junk channel added ? If comcast had an ounce of decency, no one would ever sign up for dish or hughes, unless they lived in a remote area. The satellite companies thrive because comcast stinks, through and through. Investors, you don't have an inkling how bad comcast is, and the stock price could be 2 or 5 times what it is, if you demanded they listen and serve their customers, who make money for you.",0.8655

Yes this year we've seen spearing, violent cross checking, and kneeing go uncalled. Already one player had surgery, and Crosby may have had his career shortened by another year. Even mellow Brian Bouche, the ex goalie from the Flyers admired how during the last Edmonton-Anaheim game, how the one player checked another player into the boards during an icing call. That check was outlawed by the league 3 years ago in order to protect players. But last night it was legal. SO what we have is one form of hockey during the season and another more savage form for the playoffs.

Cause one day, after a rough game, he didn't use perfect words to describe the team effort. Well after the recent loss to the Penquins, Elliot said the team put out a great effort in the first period, but not in the 2nd or third. But Barkann wont say anything. For you see, they can't get any decent goalie signed for less. Yeah, the Flyers are a good mediocre team. And when Pennsylvania and Philly built that new arena for them a few years back, they have reneged on any promises to put a really good team on the ice, and are playing the first line over and over and over, instead of playing all 4 lines. Comcast, you should pay that money back for what you did to the taxpayers. Comcast, you stink at everything you do. Except overcharging for giving less product. We've lost esquire, channel 244, the weather channel that actually shows a radar map of precipitation, and your sports fees go up, even though fewer people are watching football. Cable is dying.

All the technicians just tell me to unplug and reset my box and turn it back on they cannot send a technician out at this time and There’s nothing they can do about it. I waited on the phone yesterday for over an hour talking to some guy who has no idea other than following prompts on the computer in front of himself I asked to speak to a supervisor and after waiting for 20 minutes for a supervisor Lynne spelled LYNIE she told me that there’s been outages in the area for the last few months and she was just going to give me a credit but she assured me there would be no other problems. Since that phone call yesterday that took over an hour and a half and previous phone calls past that my Internet and TV are yet out again for the third time today. I don’t know how they became so monopolized in the industry they were not able to find other providers for cable but I don’t know too many restaurants that you would go to and eat rotten food over and over again after having the service. I really don’t understand how Comcast can be in business for this long with this kind of service it makes me understand why their stock prices don’t go anywhere.

630,"Comcast is toast.Why it mattersWith its scale and network capacity, the New T-Mobile can disrupt one of the most un-competitive and un-customer-friendly industries in existence and save American consumers billions of dollars in the process.Who it’s forFor now, only a limited few T-Mobile customers – the goal is to reach 50,000 households this year, less than .04% of U.S. households. But the New T-Mobile plans to cover more than half of U.S. zip codes by 2024 with the capacity for 9.5 million households to cut the cord. Bellevue, Washington — March 21, 2019 — The Un-carrier is prepping to disrupt one of the most uncompetitive industries in existence. Today, T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) began piloting home Internet service, sending invites to a limited group of T-Mobile customers in rural and underserved markets for high-speed fixed wireless service. It’s all part of the Un-carrier’s effort to give Americans real choice and competition for home broadband – and save consumers billions – with the New T-Mobile.The T-Mobile Home Internet pilot is offered exclusively in areas we expect to deliver speeds of around 50 Mbps through fixed unlimited wireless service over LTE – with no data caps. It’s just $50 per month with AutoPay, and because it’s from T-Mobile, there are no annual service contracts, no hidden fees and no equipment costs. Setting up the in-home router is simple, and pilot customers get support from a dedicated team of real people – from the company that consistently ranks #1 in customer service satisfaction year after year.Due to LTE network and spectrum capacity constraints, the T-Mobile Home Internet pilot is limited by invitation-only to existing customers in specific areas, with the goal of reaching 50,000 households by the end of the year – or slightly less than 0.04% of U.S. households. But if T-Mobile’s pending merger with Sprint is approved, with the added scale and capacity of the New T-Mobile, the Un-carrier plans to cover more than half of U.S. households with 5G broadband service – in excess of 100 Mbps – by 2024. And Americans stand to save billions. Today, consumers typically pay around $80 per month for wired in-home broadband service – $960 per year. Thanks to lower prices and more competition, one economist estimates that the New T-Mobile will save customers up to $13.65 billion a year on home broadband by 2024!“Two weeks ago, I laid out our plans for home broadband with the New T-Mobile. Now, we’re already hard at work building toward that future,” said John Legere, CEO of T-Mobile. “We’re walking the walk and laying the foundation for a world where we can take the fight to Big Cable on behalf of consumers and offer real choice, competition and savings to Americans nationwide.”Almost half of American households have no competitive choice for high-speed in-home broadband with speeds of 100 Mbps, and in rural areas, more than three quarters have no high-speed broadband service or only one option available. And when there’s no choice, customers suffer. It’s no wonder internet service providers and cable and satellite TV companies have the lowest customer satisfaction ratings out of 46 industries according to ACSI (American Customer Satisfaction Index)! The New T-Mobile will be armed with spectrum and network assets that will build the highest capacity wireless network in U.S. history, covering millions with 5G, not just a few people in a few blocks of a few cities like the other guys. The New T-Mobile will have the capability to cover more than half of U.S. zip codes with un-wired and un-cabled in-home broadband by 2024 and will be able to support 9.5 million American households for its high-speed in-home broadband service.Current T-Mobile customers in select areas eligible to participate in the pilot will receive T-Mobile Home Internet invitations this week by email and U.S. mail with information on how to sign up.",0.9994

Holt never asked Clinton about her e-mail scandal, about Benghazi, or about the Clinton Foundation and its dubious dealings. But he did ask Trump about his tax returns, arguing — not asking — that there might be questionable information in them that the American public deserved to hear.Birther conspiracy theory. Holt never asked Clinton about her past record of racist statements, including her “super-predator” remarks as First Lady, or her explicit appeal to “white Americans” in her 2008 primary campaign against Obama. Yet he asked Trump about the Birther conspiracy theory and cast it as racist.Stop-and-frisk. After an exchange between the candidates over the policy of “stop-and-frisk,” Holt interjected to bolster Clinton’s point by stating, erroneously, that stop-and-frisk had ended in New York because it had been declared unconstitutional by a court. Trump countered, correctly, that the new mayor had canceled the policy before the litigation was over.""A presidential look.” Towards the end of the debate, Holt asked Trump about what he meant by saying Hillary Clinton did not have “a presidential look.” He did so after noting that Clinton had become “the first woman” to be nominated for president by a major political party, thus setting Trump up as a sexist. As Trump answered, Holt interrupted him, then gave Clinton a chance to respond with her talking points about Trump’s past comments on women. Iraq War. The question of whether Trump supported the Iraq War or not has been widely debated. What is beyond doubt is that Hillary Clinton voted for it. Holt only represented one side of the debate about Trump, and never asked Clinton about her own vote.In addition, the audience repeatedly interjected — almost always in Clinton’s favor — and Holt did not stop them, though it was against the rules. He only stopped the audience when there were cheers for Trump calling for Clinton’s emails. More bias Holt and NBC in the tank for lying dishonest incompetent Hillary Clinton.

Because the press is helping to turn public opinion, so they can release him into free agency. Mason, one time, in February, after a horrible team effort, made a statement that was not perfect, and now the post game Comcast show, and the reporter, are all trying to make the fans think Mason is a bad guy. They did the same thing to some Eagles football players, and they did it to Roman Checkmonic years ago. The truth is, if everyone played day in and day out like Mason, the team would have made the playoffs.Can you believe that reporter said ""while his comments may not have bothered some players, they might have bothered others ."" ?

1296,"Comcast (CMCSA) has been moving down over the past several weeks and is down sharply for the YTD. From a technical perspective, the stock looks oversold and due for a rebound that may already have started as the stock bounced off the 30.50 level. This setup would be made more certain if there were more confirming signs, such as a double-bottom, The stock has come down toward a long-term trading support level, ie. a level at which the stock traded for a long period of time in the past. The 'theory' behind that support level is simple: there were many investors in the stock (any stock with a similar chart), who had bought and then sold during that period only to later see the stock move up from the 20s to low 30s range to over 40. The reasons for having sold during that period may have been similar to now: the 'utility' stock had run out of growth in its core cable broadband service platform and investors were uncertain about spending tens of billions on media companies or decisions of regulators. Despite a relatively stable performance record, the company lacked 'internal engines of growth'. Blah, blah, blah: that is to say that the picture looks much the same today. There are real threats over the horizon. 5G wireless will become capable of up to gigabit speeds. Even though delivering that on a consistent basis makes the grand vision of the wireless industry a challenging pursuit, the technology and huge amount of spectrum that has been plopped into MNOs laps allow the BORG Empire (mobile wireless) to go on a multi-year quest to embrace and extend their marketshare to include assimilation of home broadband and become the media pipe for both premium plans and OTT content delivery. If it sounds scary for Comcast, then you have it right... it should keep Comcast execs up at night figuring out how to unwire their brains, er HFC network. (or, rather, create the hybrid Fiber-cable+5G wireless metro-scale networks that combine with nationwide MVNO service from Verizon.The CMCSA chart looks like this is a level to accumulate for longer-term bounce back toward the mean.

If a crime is committed in a Black neighborhood, which logically translates to few Whites living there, the police will be looking for a Black that fits the description. Based on FBI statistics for 2016 there were 9,374 murders & non-negligent manslaughter arrests in the US. Of these, African American arrests accounted for 4,935 or 53% of the total. African Americans are 12.3% of the population, but account for 53% of the arrests for murders. Or, there were 76,267 Robberies. Of these African Americans arrests accounted for 41,562 or 54% of the total. That's disparity.This police brutality is exaggerated way out of proportion. The exaggeration seems orchestrated. Racism is used almost in every sentence and every discussion these days.The next comment I hear from the football players taking a knee is disparity in school opportunities. I cannot comprehend that comment! We have been busing kids across towns since the sixties to distribute them into all neighborhoods. That destroyed the trend of people purchasing homes near a school for their children. Even Black mothers have complained about that. After 50 years of affirmative action schools have set up quotas for Blacks disproportionate to Whites. They have lowered entrance qualifications for Blacks. Some Blacks chastise others for trying to do well in school. Blacks are given preferential treatment before Asians and people with a higher aptitude score are being bypassed. There are Black only schools. Still the Blacks are disproportionately more likely to drop out or not go on to college.Next it’s job opportunities. Again, 50 years of affirmative action gave us set asides, quotas, preferences, lowering standards, and many more special treatment for Blacks. With disproportionate amount of dropouts in schools, Blacks have a harder time meeting job and skill requirements. I think some Blacks get jobs they aren’t qualified for. The Media and Liberals make the Blacks look like they are 50% of the population. They are 13% of the population. Depicted another way, if there are eight people in a group we should only expect to see one Black. Yet the media, the press, and liberals create a 50% image in commercials, movies, TV shows, committees, etc. If there are more than two people or actors in an entity there must be a Black. That’s disparity!Music awards. RAP has been added to the music awards program. In all recorded time any vocal can be played as an instrumental. With RAP, taking out the words leaves just an incessant repetitive drum beat. Then there's the pornographic words, degradation of women, and crotch grabbing. That's not music, that's garbage and music disparity! Fifty years of affirmative action and the Black demographics have hardly changed. Most of the single mother families, fatherless children, families with children from different men, a disproportionate amount of crimes, a disproportionate amount of druggies, disproportionate amount of prison population, and multiple generations that have never worked are all Black demographic disparities. Our welfare system, controlled by Democrats, perpetuates these demographics. This current wave of unrest amongst Blacks started with the totally false “Hands up don’t shoot” movement followed by the “Black lives matter” movement and their chant “What do we want? DEAD COPS! When do we want it? NOW!” This increase of tension sure seems orchestrated and is setting back years of Black accomplishments and their movement.I fear people will become desensitized to the real problems with this incessant rant of racism. This problem will never end until the Black demographics change and they have leaders that really want to improve Black and White relations and improve the Black demographics.",-0.9297

Here is bonus information for you:)*Written by Dr. Jack Wheeler:*The O-man, Barack Hussein Obama, is an eloquently tailored empty suit. Noresume, no accomplishments, no experience, no original ideas, nounderstanding of how the economy works, no understanding of how the worldworks, no balls, nothing but abstract, empty rhetoric devoid of realsubstance.He has no real identity. He is half-white, which he rejects. The rest ofhim is mostly Arab, which he hides but is disclosed by his non-AfricanArabic surname and his Arabic first and middle names as a way to triplyproclaim his Arabic parentage to people in Kenya. Only a small part of himis African Black from his Luo grandmother, which he pretends he isexclusively.What he isn't, not a genetic drop of, is 'African-American,' the descendantof enslaved Africans brought to America chained in slave ships. He hasn't asingle ancestor who was a slave. Instead, his Arab ancestors were slaveowners. Slave-trading was the main Arab business in East Africa forcenturies until the British ended it.Let that sink in: Obama is not the descendant of slaves, he is thedescendant of slave owners. Thus he makes the perfect Liberal Messiah.It's something Hillary doesn't understand - how some complete neophyte cameout of the blue and stole the Dem nomination from her. Obamamania is beyondpolitics and reason. It is a true religious cult, whose adherents rejectChristianity yet still believe in Original Sin, transferring it from theevil of being human to the evil of being white.Thus Obama has become the white liberals' Christ, offering absolution fromthe Sin of Being White. There is no reason or logic behind it, no faults orflaws of his can diminish it, no arguments Hillary could make of any kindcan be effective against it. The absurdity of Hypocrisy Clothed In HumanFlesh being their Savior is all the more cause for liberals to worship him: Credo quia absurdum, I believe it because it is absurd.*Thank heavens that the voting majority of Americans remain Christian andare in no desperate need of a phony savior.*He is ridiculous and should not be taken seriously by any thinkingAmerican.And yet he got elected, not once but twice. Thanks to those that did notthink it was important to vote for freedom and those that were willing togive up their freedoms for entitlements.*Remember you don't have to be on a southern plantation to be a slave, **if you are dependent on government entitlements you just have a differentslave owner.**PASS THIS ON TO EVERY THINKING AMERICAN YOU KNOW!*",-0.1834

I see where anaylsts are predicting earning to increase in the high teens this year. How do you value a stock like this average p/e, dividend, cash flow, debt/equity. They look good on most of these. Their drop in price ytd is historic, what is overvalued. I think the dividend is to low for price support. It does appear to be at a good technical support level in the $30 to $32 level. I just don’t see this going up a whole lot in the next year especially when there will be many questions on debt when and if they make the sky acquisitions. That being said I bought 100 shares (31.60)to keep an eye on it as it appears to be in a good support range. If this breaks below $30 I think it goes to the $25 range. Although if not much changed with earning projections and dividends that would be a great buy. Although that would be a 40% drop from their recent high and a dividend of 3%.
