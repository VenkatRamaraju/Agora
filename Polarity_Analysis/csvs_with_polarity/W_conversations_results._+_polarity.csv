24,"Today's $20 billion enterprise valuation is 1.2-times the sales and 170-times the operating cash flow predicted for 2021 by the analysts that FactSet surveys. Wayfair's ( W ) sales multiple is smaller than rivals like Amazon ( AMZN ), but most big e- commerce firms have real cash flow. A return to Wayfair's ( W ) average price of 0.9-times forward sales would drop the stock 25%.The company has had a harder time proving that it can make money on those sales. While Wayfair ( W ) revenues grew by a third in 2019, its net loss doubled to $985 million, or $10.68 a share. Like most public companies these days, Wayfair ( W ) likes to direct investors to measures of cash flow that omit expenses otherwise counted under generally-accepted accounting principles. Any way you look at it, however, the business burned cash. Its ""adjusted"" earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were negative $500 million in 2019 -- more than double the negative number of the prior year. Include capital spending and software development, and Wayfair's ( W) negative free cash flow surged fourfold last year, to minus $600 million.",0.7288

30,"Goldman's Algo seems to be about 40% of the traded volume. The equity is dislocated from the market. It does not appear to be widely held or followed. Debt - all convertible to equity at the choice of Wayfair. The conversion rates made sense if the stock went to $280. At current levels, the debt is worth nothing.A source of ""financing"" that few people spot is the gap between A/R and A/P. this number is HUGE for W. that works fine as long as sales are ALWAYS increasing. I yields a boomerang effect if / when sales slow. I am guessing that sales are very slow. Wayfair does not have enough cash to pay the A/P balance. Usually financing agreements have cross-default clauses. If W fails to pay their vendors, then supply will terminate immediately. This singular element can unwind Wayfair in 7 weeks.",-0.4103

60,loosing out due to a trade war is irrelevant since Wyfair already looses what amount to a negative 10% of revenue .They cannot make a profit without the tariffs so these business factors are just more noise to the business of stock options and management enrichment.

62,I know nothing about this stock. But I do know something about the junk they sell. They shipped me furniture where the parts did not fit. When I try to get to customer service it takes me 5 days. They sell junk that is very cheap. I am shocked that people buy this stock without verifying that what they sell is quality. Wayfair is not quality. It is the cheapest junk you can find and this will eventually catch up with them and people will not buy cheaply and poorly made items and furniture. Total junk.,0.8886
63,"This has about the same ""market capitzliation"" as Ikea which seems on the conservative side. No one can currently really go to Ikea and Wayfair can sell online so they don't have to worry about the ""covid virus.""

65,"“Potential threatsWayfair reported revenue growth headwinds in Canada in the second quarter. This was due to macroeconomic challenges that could persist over the medium term. The outlook for the retailer's wider international business could deteriorate as, according to the GfK consumer sentiment index, confidence among U.K. shoppers is at its lowest level since 2013. Similarly, U.S. consumer confidence reached its lowest level in almost three years in August, which may slow down the company's near-term sales performance.In response to weak trading conditions in Canada, the company is seeking to reduce its costs through increasing investments in its supply chain. This caused an improvement in its sales performance in the second quarter versus the first quarter. This trend is expected to continue for the remainder of the year.Although consumer confidence in the U.K. is low at the moment, wage growth is at its highest level since 2008. This should help to support demand for the company's products, with the retailer's second-quarter results highlighting that its U.K. operations are performing in line with its own previous guidance. In addition, the region contributed to a 47% increase in international revenue in the second quarter.”",0.9745

238,"Example of a Stock Bubble: eToysThe internet bubble around the turn of the 21st century was an especially dramatic one. Numerous internet-related companies made their public debut in spectacular fashion in the late1990s before disappearing into oblivion by 2002. The story of eToys illustrates how the stages of a stock bubble typically play out.A Rosy StartIn May 1999, with the internet revolution in full swing, eToys had a very successful initial public offering, where shares at $20 each escalated to $78 on their first trading day. The company was less than three years old at that point and had grown sales to $30 million for the year ended March 31, 1999, from $0.7 million in the preceding year. Investors were very enthusiastic about the stock's prospects, with the general thinking being that most toy buyers would buy toys online rather than at retail stores such as Toys ""R"" Us. This was the displacement phase of the bubble.As the 8.3 million shares soared in its first day of trading on the Nasdaq, giving it a market value of $6.5 billion, investors were eager to buy the stock. While eToys had posted a net loss of $28.6 million on revenues of $30 million in its most recent fiscal year, investors were expecting the financial situation of the firm to take a turn for the best. By the time markets closed on May 20, eToys sported a price/sales valuation that was largely exceeding that of rival Toys ""R"" Us, which had a stronger balance sheet. This marked the boom and euphoria stages of the bubble.Shortly afterward, eToys fell 9% on concern that potential sales by company insiders could drag down the stock price, following the expiry of lockup agreements that placed restrictions on insider sales. Trading volume was exceptionally heavy that day, at nine times the three-month daily average. The day's drop marked a 40% decline in the stock, from its record high of $86, identifying this as the profit-taking phase of the bubble.Decline and FallBy March 2000, the panic stage had arrrived: eToys had tumbled 81% from its October peak to about $16 on concerns about its spending. The company was spending an extraordinary $2.27 on advertising costs for every dollar of revenue generated. Although the investors were saying that this was the new economy, such a business model simply is not sustainable.In July 2000, eToys reported its fiscal first-quarter loss widened to $59.5 million from $20.8 million a year earlier, even as sales tripled over this period to $24.9 million. It added 219,000 new customers during the quarter, but the company was not able to show bottom-line profits. By this time, with the ongoing correction in technology shares, the stock was trading around $5.Towards the end of the year, with losses continuing to mount, eToys would not meet its fiscal third-quarter sales forecast and had just four months of cash left. The stock, which had already been caught up in the panic selling of internet-related stocks since March and was trading around at slightly over $1, fell 73% to 28 cents by February 2001. Since the company failed to retain a stable stock price of at least $1, it was delisted from the Nasdaq.A month after it had reduced its workforce by 70%, eToys fired its remaining 300 workers and was forced to declare bankruptcy. By this time, eToys had lost $493 million over the previous three years and had $274 million in outstanding debt.TL:DR THIS IS A BUBBLE. DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU.",0.8729

Assuming Wayfair can achieve the extremely optimistic projection going forward and maintain $2.4/ share earning year after year, it would take about 100 years to return current share price of $236.

Not sustainable in this industry for profit.3- on bigger furniture items they sell cheaper/ low priced items making freight costs a higher % of cost of goods. ( costs to ship a $1000 bedroom is the same for a $3000 one )4- there plan is & as always been to buy market share with crazy advertising expenditures & believe that once lock in - They can go on autopilot with new continual purchases.5- plan is not achieve able because...A- customers are only loyal to good service & price . B- they will continue to chase the top line vs bottom line # creating further stress on cash.C - since February of 2020 the home related purchases have been “unprecedentedly at record highs” Any furniture operation with half a brain is going great with the exception of slow delivery of orders from factories.Once the orders start to soften & it’s just starting.

The market and at least one analyst appear to think so.Shares of the payments company founded and run by Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey are up 173% this year. Earlier this week Nomura Instinet analyst Dan Dolev poured gasoline on the fire with a note saying Square should join the ranks of the famous FANG stocks— Facebook , FB 1.24% Amazon, Netflix and Google—which have dominated market gains in recent years.The note’s flashy headline was picked up widely by media outlets including CNBC, sending Square shares up 11% in one day.The entire episode is reminiscent of the late 1990s, when analysts would slap arbitrarily high price targets on rising stocks, hatching up novel valuation arguments and relying on relative comparisons to other overvalued companies.",0.9945

Because their customers ARE NOT COMING BACK.So they continue to burn people over and over and over again.This is the big story that doesn't get talked about... but probably will eventually.The interesting thing is... if you go to Wayfair's site, all the reviews are good.Danger.

However, I feel that the complete lack of professionalism and customer service I have encountered in dealing with Wayfair has warranted a public review. I hope my experience serves as a warning to others as they contemplate giving their business to Wayfair. This was my first experience with Wayfair and will definitely be my last.1 starI’ve ordered from Wayfair on several different occasions. From beds, to dresser sets and even pillows for my couch. On two occasions I was sent entirely different items from what I purchased and another time wrong sizes. The problem is in all actuality, the incompetence of the warehouse workers who seemingly pack whatever they want to apparently, but the bigger problem is the customer service and the so called supervisors who handle your issues as if you're the one who caused them.1 starOriginal review: July 20, 2020I had ordered from Wayfair in the past but they have gone way downhill. I ordered furniture as a gift. Not only did they not deliver as promised, but there was no communication. After multiple phone calls with hold times approaching two hours, I was promised 25 percent off and delivery the next day. Neither of these promises were fulfilled, and phone call was never recorded. I have now been told that I don't get the discout, I had another promise of next day delivery that wasn't met. I am not six weeks past the date of the original scheduled delivery with no ship date in sight. I will be avoiding this company in the future, as should you.maybe you should ask the analysts to buy something from W and then make a rating on them. They pollute with all the foam they use in packaging. Wake up!",0.9934

I covered at $92 and made a killing. I watched the action after i was out. Same action-- steady rise for no reason--pure manipulation. So now I have been shorting this new rise (many short trades below $130 and a big one in $160s) I am stuck. But I have the money to hold the short and add more to it. Wayfair will fall again. And when it does, it will fall quickly -- again. Any game has its end. And the only winner in the Wayfair trading is a short.--W has no chance in a recession when consumers cut their spending--recessions kill growth model stocks--high institutional held stocks are fun to watch in early recession trading--the funds try to kill eachother trying to get out before all of the othersI am primarily a currency trader, so I have to review global eceonomic activity. Global economic activity is slowing quickly. The US is in the best shape, but we ARE heading towards a recession. When the US/China trade deal breaks, I believe the markets will ""sell the news"" as equities have already risen 20% in the last 2 months. I will cover my current W position below $50 this time.

How many trips to the store did it take you? If so, you know how hard it is to find what you need or like and then decide if it matches in style and fits in size. And you encounter this problem both online and at physical stores. Today’s purchase process requires you to spend lots of time, multiple store trips, settle for whatever you find available and then spend even more time to return the product if you discover at home that it does not fit. We are building the technology that will eliminate such problems.We are looking for a seasoned senior manager who will guide a team of scientists. Your team will work on (1) image deep learning techniques to visually understand products and home landscapes at scale (2) natural language processing (NLP) to help discover the right products for customers with the opportunity expand on 3D geometry and mixed reality.

They kept tagging my account for almost 300 every week saying, ""Don't worry. It will drop off in two to three business days,"" and that they will keep tagging the account every week til it's shipped, but my bank keeps them pending for ten days, so I asked them to just take it and stop tagging my account, the chair was due to be shipped yesterday, and the website kept saying it was in the process of being shipped. I looked at the website again today and it said it was on back order! With an estimated delivery date of July 9th, 2020. So now I'm on hold waiting to speak to someone, getting the same recording as everyone else, 25 or more mins. It's been 40 mins already. First time ordering from this place and the last time as well.

Following a spectacular 2017 in which Wayfair cemented its global leadership position as the go-to online destination for all things home, we believe the brand is evolving into a true juggernaut and plan to maintain our full position in 2018.After returning 130% gains to investors in 2017, we see continued momentum for Wayfair and its shares in the year ahead driven by ongoing market share gain both domestically and in Europe, continued investment in infrastructure and technologies that will drive awareness, adoption, and retention of new and existing consumers to the Wayfair brand. Domestically, both Castlegate and WDN achieved critical mass in 2017 and while continued investment in these back end components should continue this year, we predict it will decline significantly as a percentage of revenue/gross profit thus moving the company from cash flow positive to essentially break even domestically; a huge positive driver for continued share price acceleration.We also expect heavy investment this year in building out the European market which is tracking where Wayfair was domestically about two years ago. While this will impact the short-term profit outlook, the investment will further cement Wayfair as a true global brand with an ever-widening moat as it disrupts an entire industry.We maintain a STRONG BUY conviction on shares of Wayfair in 2018 and set a 12 month price target at $121, excluding the potential of being acquired.GL and GO WAYFAIR!!!",0.996

It would take a long time before suppliers decided to pass this on.On another not I realize shipping bulky items is not ideal, but a lot of products are actually soft goods that do not damage easily and judging from the prices our products are sold at there is in fact a good amount of margin for W.Lastly we have tried multiple online platforms, etsy, amazon, wayfair etc.. and nothing even comes close to the traction W gets.

This table was delivered by a 3rd party freight company to my house a few days ago and it is damaged in 2 places. So now Wayfair has to pick up this table and replace again at a 20% discount, plus they already gave me a free smaller table to get me through Thanksgiving.

If it pops above $180, I will wait for a leveling off and then short much more.Not many retail traders here, as W is basically an institutional fund game.

2349,"Everyone should sell Wayfair(W) and buy Kirkland(KIRK). Last year Wayfair proved their furniture model doesn't work. Amazon and Walmart were watching them super close to see if Furniture and Home Decor can be an online only business and it can't. People still enjoy seeing and feeling those types of products before buying. Pier 1 imports failed due to garbage leadership and too many stores. Pier 1 filed bankrupcty to mirror Kirklands model and because of this Pier 1 will be emerging from bankrupcty with a similar store count as Kirklands but with a new owner. Several buyers have already shown an interest in Pier 1 which has $350+ million in debt and zero assets. Kirkland is already at the store footprint as Pier 1, has no debt, reduced expenses from operations, reported an increase in cash flow from 3rd qtr to 4th qtr, and reported their sales 2 weeks prior to the earnings call. They are nearly done in their turnaround and will be the right size to balance out e-commerce and stores to be profitable. Another thing to note is that if Pier 1 does sell to a buyer then Kirklands stock price will jump especially since they are much better positioned. Why buy Pier 1 when you can buy Kirklands? so in essence once Pier 1 announces the sale amount everyone owning KIRK will make a lot of money riding the stock price up to the same market cap valuation. I believe Pier 1 will sale withing the range of $600-900 million. You can do the math. Good luck to all who want to make money.",0.9931

Curiously, they seem to be attempting to borrow from Wayfair's model (more flattery!) of massive warehouses, plus sophisticated logistics and last mile delivery control. Rather than run and hide, Wayfair bulls are basking in the attention and recognition that Wayfair has, indeed, built the better mouse trap that eluded very other furniture etailer that came, and failed, before them. So, will Amazon succeed or fail? Time will tell, but they'll need at least two years at full throttle to get where Wayfair is today. And by then, Wayfair will have had another two years to perfect the model Amazon wants to mimic. First mover advantage goes to Wayfair.Of course, WMT is watching this unfold and must be asking themselves, ""Where's ours?""

Noone ever tells new hires this, because they are afraid they'll turn down the position once they realize theyll make no money.

We expect strong trends in the home category will continue through next year and HOME's big box, off-mall, value store model is perfectly positioned for the current environment. In addition, market share gains from competitor store closings, continued expansion of its omni-channel offerings and improved execution provide additional comp sales tailwinds. The company's balance sheet is significantly improved (1.4x leverage a record low), the concept remains underpenetrated and At Home will return to 10% store growth in FY22.

3397,"Floridians? Covered!! Three new spokes off the Atlanta hub cover the Sunshine State in first-class, last-mile delivery.---snip----->from the Tampa Bay Biz JournalWayfair, an online retailer that specializes in home goods from sofas to wall art, is opening a Tampa distribution center as part of a major Florida expansion.The new Tampa location is just over 45,000 square feet, according to Gov. Rick Scott's office, which also announced Wayfair distribution centers in Orlando and Miami on Tuesday.The Tampa warehouse is technically in Riverview, in Oak Creek Commerce Park, at 8147 Eagle Palm Drive. Kris Courier and Rian Smith, a team of brokers from CBRE Group Inc. in Tampa, represented the landlord, EastGroup, in the transaction.Courier said Tuesday that Wayfair started searching for warehouse space in the Tampa area about a year ago and was considering another spot in Oak Creek — but another company snatched that up. When Smith Cargo Transportation Services Inc. moved into another building within the park, Courier said, he and Smith reached out to Wayfair, and they were interested in backfilling that space.Wayfair moved into the space about three months ago, Courier said.Combined, the new distribution centers represent 100 jobs, including management and customer positions. Wayfair has current job listings in Tampa for home delivery concierge positions.""Our new Florida distribution centers are part of our growing logistics network, which allows us to expand our world-class delivery experience with fast shipping of furniture, décor, home improvement items and more to millions of consumers,"" a Wayfair spokeswoman wrote in an email Tuesday.The Florida locations come more than a year after Wayfair opened a Southeastern hub in the metro Atlanta area, creating 150 jobs there.An October story in the New York Times details Wayfair's plans to overhaul its logistics operations, bringing much of it in-house instead of using third-party companies, particularly for last-mile deliveries.""The expansion of our operations in Tampa, Orlando and Miami will ensure that we continue to provide exceptional service every step of the way as we transform the shopping experience for home all the way through to delivery,"" James Savarese, Wayfair's chief operating officer, said in a statement. ""We are pleased to open three new state-of-the-art facilities in Florida and contribute to the creation of new job opportunities across the state."" Based on the size and location of Wayfair's Tampa distribution center — on the small side for a warehouse user and closer to the city's population base than Plant City or Lakeland — it is likely for last-mile deliveries.""That's right in the same size range as we’ve seen other e-commerce groups for last mile delivery,"" Courier said.",0.9974

3440,"A Bushel of Lemons Awarded to Citron, Wayfair's Most Vocal BearA year ago this month, semi-professional short seller, Andy Left, of Citron Research (who's book is smaller than Trump's hands) penned a hilarious critique of Wayfair and declared it was heading to under $10 within a year. It was the next Overstock, doomed to fail, poorly managed, and quite simply ""the best short he'd ever seen"". Following the release of this analysis and declaring it his largest short position, Wayfair shares sold off several dollars to $32. Doubling down, Left then said Wayfair was really worth $0.Today, Wayfair trades at roughly $39 per share - putting Left badly under water with his short, and even further away from his target price of under $10. So why was Left, and fellow CNBC-fueld ego-maniac, Whitney Tilson (who declared Wayfair was flooding the market with Formaldehyde drenched flooring and furniture) so far off on the predicted outcome for Wayfair? Simple: they're lazy hacks with no meaningful insight into the Wayfair brand, it's operations, it's customers, or its potential. Moreover, by ignoring larger marketplace trends, they'll likely to wake up one morning to a text from Mr. Max Pain, informing them that Wayfair has been acquired by (insert your favorite brick and mortar ecommerce laggard here) for a hefty premium. Ouch! (see Jet.com for reference).So, profitable longs, join me in wishing Citron a Happy Anniversary on it's bombastic call on Wayfair.

In addition to that, for 3 items I bought, Wayfair gave me $5 for each review I wrote on their website. Now, I dont remember Amzn offering me $$ to write review. Having your customers write reviews is concept of leveraging OPW (other people's work) which is not the case with Wayfair. This dude is burning money like there is no tomorrow. He has good company in HMNY (check it out, $9.99 / month for unlimited movies at any theatre of choice).

4044,"Wayfair Inc. – Lying by OmissionW reported solid 2Q19 results that beat on revenues, adjusted EPS and customers but that’s only the glass-half-full version. Total net revenue increased 42% YoY to $2.343BN, with domestic business running at EBITDA breakeven while international burned $70MM. Free cash flow was negative $91MM.Management saved guidance “for the call” with analysts and excluded it from the press release, a clear case of lying by omission that duped the media into pushing the stock on W’s 2Q beat and a possible Reg FD violation. Forecasts call for flat top line in 3Q19 with total net revenue of $2.23-2.28BN. Guidance is for negative EBITDA of 2%-3% in the U.S. and negative 6.0%-6.5% overall ($120-130MM total operational burn). Adding in capex of $50-70MM will balloon free cash burn to an estimated $200MM further eroding liquidity. With gross margins of under 25%, these metrics do not support an entity trading at $12BN in market cap. or over 1.3x annualized sales.A review of W’s financials and SEC filings casts doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in our opinion:Annual losses of hundreds of millions of dollars,A dwindling current ratio of 0.7 with cash funding for one year,A semi-toxic series of convertible loans that makes it difficult to compute the derivative impact on the stock price or returns to shareholders,A P&L and cashflow statement predicated on massive capex and overhead to deliver heavy furniture products across the U.S. and Europe with no hope of generating excess returns let alone cash flow.The abrupt same day resignations of W’s CTO and COO last month and insider stock sales by W’s CFO may foreshadow something ominous in the cards for this overpriced particle board shipper. We believe the Company will have to execute a substantial financing to shore up its balance sheet, and in this market dominated by Trump trade tariff headlines we think any deal would get done far lower than current levels, if at all.Management said one thing right on their “analyst call” – nothing is a straight line to EBITDA+. In this case, we see a straight line to distress. Just because you spend billions of dollars creating something to migrate traditional business processes online does not mean it is worth anything in the future as a standalone Company. We are initiating W with a SELL recommendation and near-term price target of $50, which is approximately 0.5x annualized revenues or $4.5BN and based on 92.5MM shares O/S.Disclosure: I am/we are short W.Additional disclosure: We intend to provide additional comments in the future in our ongoing coverage of W.",0.8559

4129,"The higher Wayfair revenue goes, the higher their losses and cash burn. Their customer service will automatically issue credit up to 26% of invoice value if you call and complain about damage, wrong size, wrong color, etc. If you say you want replacement, they often times say just keep the item they originally sent, and then send replacement. Poor packaging by manufacturers, poor handling by warehouse personnel and cartage drivers, and poorly trained warehouse personnel at suppliers and Wayfair picking wrong items to fulfill orders is costing Wayfair hundreds of millions of dollars a year.

She returned the table and they sent another table but it was damaged also. The one missing chair did arrived undamaged and they told her to keep the original 2 damaged chairs. She shipped the table back and a new one arrived with a scratch on it. Wayfair said they would send their repair company to fix the table. So long story short... she eventually accepted the last table delivered with the repaired scratch at 1/2 price. Wayfair said it was the way the MFG was packaging the merchandise.

4374,"Forget the tariff news; that’s just the trigger that might send the market down, but not what will ultimately make it spiral. There’s a corporate debt crisis — $9t today, compared to just $4t in 08— that is looming in plain sight, only few people choose to see it. You have companies with hugely inflated valuations, and whose valuations are what they are because of all-time highs in stock buybacks (thus racking up more debt, just at a lower interest rate). The yield curve is inverted, one of the best signs of a recession — the bond market signals a recession before the stock market does — yet people keep buying.I parked my money in cash back in October of last year. Yes, I’ve missed the nice run at the start of the year, and will probably miss another towards the end of the year or early next year. But there are signs EVERYWHERE that this bull market, while probably not at its end, is going to see one soon, and it’s likely to be a big dive when it does.I’m short W and many others right now. These companies, specially in recessions and corrections, will do what the old saying says: “Take the stairs up, and the elevator down.” It will be a hard, fast fall. Good luck to the longs.

As of May 15th per market watch 15.35 million shares are short or around 25% of the float which are shows available to the public!What fidelity is doing is they are calling in margin and changing the equity reserve ratios for W whenever they want to sell the stock after they do their short sale washout run-up it happened to me twice. I was up over 40,000 on the trade and the next day I got a margin call went it moved against me by only 20,000 on 2500 shares short apparently it was sooo risky they changes the margin reserves. Not only are they doing this they of course keep records of all of their users trading data. The reason commissions are free as that data is being used by algos and internal traders to make moves. Perhaps all of the brokers are selling the trading data for the algos databases. The low float combined with these shenanigans allows them to do the following:Dow futures are up. The shorts cover at the open usually having been beaten by a several day run-up in the stock. Then they Fidelity et all sell a truck load of stock from 9:00am CST – around noonish. Which I believe is them trying to reduce their exposure here in the longer-term, Then they stop and let the rookies come and bid it up and then they come back late in the day and either sell a little more or bid the stock up so it closes between -5 - + 2. They then sell into the poor suckers like me that they force to cover shares from the margin call to help ease the pain from the prior run-up. Rinse wash and repeat. This can go on indefinitely. God knows they have the pockets for it. For me I covered my shares at the close. They are never going to just let this drop to like 130 or 150 like it should. They want the shorts in here so they can keep this racket going. Yes, it is definitely shadey as hell! Just short this pig every time they push past 180. It will drop eventually much further!",0.9971

Major market benchmarks flirted with losses early in the day, but a broad-based advance took hold by the afternoon. At the end of the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) were all higher by 1% to 2%.Today's stock marketIndexPercentage ChangePoint ChangeDow+1.11%+260S&P 500+1.39%+39Nasdaq Composite+1.65%+140DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE.There were some big individual stock winners on the day. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) got a nice boost as it decided to take on rivals in a hot area of technology. Meanwhile, Wayfair (NYSE:W) faced the unusual situation of having an analyst company make two calls on the stock in one day, but shareholders didn't seem disappointed.Facebook takes on Zoom, MicrosoftShares of Facebook rose 3% Friday following its decision to add a feature to its social media platform. The new functionality will allow users to take advantage of video chat capabilities, in the hopes of grabbing some market share from competitors.Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) has been one of the biggest success stories of 2020, as the video conferencing specialist has seen its core audience jump to 300 million users. Zoom and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have been the primary rivals in the collaboration space on the enterprise side.Facebook doesn't exactly have an enterprise focus, but it's hoping to co-opt some of the more casual use that Zoom has seen more recently. Messenger Rooms will allow up to 50 people join without a charge, and it looks quite a bit like the Zoom interface.Based on the stock's reaction, investors like that Facebook is defending its turf by coming out with a competing video chat platform. Whether it'll eat into Zoom's business or not remains to be seen, but adding new features has been part of Facebook's long-term success for years.Room with furniture including couch, loveseat, table, ottoman, lamp, mirror, and various accessories along with rug.IMAGE SOURCE: WAYFAIR.Wayfair gets praised, then downgradedElsewhere, online furniture specialist Wayfair saw its stock soar 17%. Wayfair got positive comments from a stock analysis company early Friday, but then that same company changed its rating a second time later in the day.Early on, Wayfair got positive comments from analysts at Stifel, including lifting the price target on the stock by $40 to $115 per share. Wayfair repeated its buy rating, noting that the impact of the coronavirus pandemic would force furniture shoppers online and potentially boost the e-commerce specialist's business.Yet after the stock's jump, Stifel came back and cut its rating on the stock from buy to hold. That might seem like a quick response, but given that the stock's $18 upward move took the price above $122 per share -- well above the $115 per share price target -- the downgrade based on valuation seemed justified.It's not every day that you see one analyst give two different views on a stock.
