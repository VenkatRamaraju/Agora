His view is that the announcement was a positive for Nvidia but complicated the merger approval. For one thing, he wrote in a previous research note, it “shows what Nvidia can deliver with or without” a deal to actually buy Arm.

555,"HBO’s Bill Maher says Portland police departures are ‘a cautionary tale’By Kristi Turnquist | The Oregonian/OregonLiveIn his latest comments on Portland, HBO’s Bill Maher touched on the topic of police, and referred to the departure of Portland police officers as “a cautionary tale,” warning, “We do not want to live in a world without police. Then it’s ‘The Purge’ every night.”During the most recent episode of “Real Time with Bill Maher,” the host said he was heartened to see members of law enforcement testify in the murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, and be willing to criticize Chauvin for kneeling on the neck of the late George Floyd for more than nine minutes. Maher was encouraged, he said, to see police “finally testifying against their own.”Maher then brought up Portland, where he said there was an “exodus” of police. “I mean, if you’re one of those people who wants antifa to get results, you win....It may not be the one you want. But 115 police officers have left” in Portland, Maher went on to say. “That’s a lot, in a city that size.”As The Oregonian/OregonLive has reported, “Since July 1, 115 officers have left the Police Bureau, including 74 who retired and 41 who resigned. Two more will resign by the end of this month and one more is retiring. They make up one of the biggest waves of departures in recent memory.”In the Oregonian/OregonLive story, some portions of police exit interviews are quoted. Maher was apparently referring to that report when he said that in Portland, “one retired detective said, ‘The community shows zero support. The mayor and the council ignore actual facts on crime.”Maher then said, “Portland, it’s a cautionary tale,” adding, “‘Cause we do not want to live in a world without police. Then it’s ‘The Purge’ every night,” alluding to the horror franchise in which, for a time, crime is legal.",0.283

667,"5+ YEARS OUTLOOK! I see $intc restructure its business to focus on fab manufacturing only, in the USA and Western countries like EU, Israel etc with significant Gov funding for independence of chips manufacturing national security goals vs relying on Taiwan and South Korea. Intel will sell its x86 franchise to probably nVidia as so $nvda won't buy ARM nor will it be approved as it's a UK national security and China too especially with China ARM CEO lawsuit going on. But in the next few years, AMD will rise especially as tge Xilinx merger get AMD to become the dominant chips supplier of the world. AMD's ARM architecture license allows them to make own designs compatible with ARM and Samsung has the financial muscles and fabs to fabricate such chips. AMD will grow significantly, render ARM licensing business mostly obsolete as their chips will have an intermix ECOSYSTEM of x86 pin compatible sockets, servers, mobile, laptops, PCs and added GPUs, FPGAs and other heterogeneous accelerators. Won't make sense for any company to do their own, even Amazon and Apple! So in the next 5 years, AMD is the stocks to hold all the way to $1000 SP. After many turbulences for Intel and nVidia, with significant SP decline, they could be a buy 5 years from now. If th above happens...Intel will be a pure fab manufacturing company at bigger size than TSMC after 5 years without own chips designs. While nVidia's only chance is to buy Intel's chips designs businesses, Mobileye, Altera FPGAs, x86 desigs to survive vs AMD. Intel's Flash storage will be sold to other company, it's different business than computing. Hence Bob Swan ex Intel's CEO, to stop Intel's dependency on x86, is the begining of the above long transformation, new CEO is executing with $20B fab investment, collaboration with IBM on fab technology, and starting an open fab business.",0.996

I could see one in the future, even though I don’t want it and don’t feel it’s needed at this point. The authorization gives NVDA the freedom to do several things with the shares down the road, but to think it means an immediate change is coming is simply unfounded.

Although both of these will have a large effect on GPU mining it’s true. You’ll see the mining industry start to lose pace this summer as miners sell off their cards before the jacked up prices begin to fall. Nvidia are not the ones making the money on these jacked up prices to begin with.. it’s aftermarket and scalpers. When mining goes away Nvidia GPUs will continue to fly off shelves. Gamers are demanding these cards since they came out. Gaming is also the biggest and fastest growing entertainment industry. Nvidia will have some ups and downs due to being linked with mining but this company will go nowhere but up long term. AMD is still playing catch up in the graphics department. I may not suggest when you should buy this stock but it is a great long term play. I’m a gamer and a miner so take from that what you will. Even with a silicon shortage effecting all businesses this is temporary.. the pandemic has caused a large increase to the gaming community and trust me it isn’t going to fade as things go back to “normal.” If you’re interested in this stock timing could be difficult but there is a ton of upside with their data centres, gaming and the huge possibility of the arm deal closing.",0.9956

It wouldn't surprise me if 50% of their sales come from miners. This is eerily reminiscent of the 2018 run up and subsequent crash of the stock. Despite NVIDIA's (let's call them mediocre at best) efforts to ""control"" cryptomining, miners have found fairly easy workarounds allowing them to use the cards for mining anyways. I'm an avid gamer and have been trying to purchase one of these cards since launch but you can't pre-order them and they're being snatched up by bots everywhere. The US constitution states that only the government can coin and regulate currency. With cryptocurrency getting more negative attention from global governments as a worthless/speculative stock/currency, all it's going to take is someone to bring up this portion of the constitution and bitcoin and the like will lose their value overnight, dragging Nvidia along with it. I think a reckoning is coming and Nvidia is going to pay the price for not doing more to prevent miners from snatching up all the card stock. South Korea and India are already looking at banning cryptocurrencies. I think the U.S. will soon follow.",0.9118

You nailed it.""Raymond James analyst Chris Caso downgraded Intel to Underperform from Market Perform, reflecting the risk that Intel won't reach its goals under new leadership, and also the pain they will likely endure in pursuit of that goal in terms of capex, lost market share, and a shifting landscape in datacenter that will make the industry less dependent on Intel. Caso is concerned that demand in the PC market, on which Intel remains highly dependent, has been significantly pulled forward due to the pandemic, and expects an eventual mean reversion, which may occur just as Intel needs to ramp investment, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The analyst is also ""skeptical"" about the foundry business.""""Raymond James analyst Chris Caso upgraded Nvidia to Strong Buy from Outperform with a price target of $750, up from $700, reflecting conviction in both the short- and long-term. In the short-term, Caso thinks results will be more dependent on supply than demand given widespread shortages, and thinks improvement in enterprise, driven by a return to the office as well as the A10 launch, could drive better Datacenter growth in 2H, the analyst tells investors in a research note.

2136,"Should you buy Nvidia stock? Here are the key numbers to look at nowMentioned:AMD AVGO INTC NVDA QCOMBy Philip van Doorn Nvidia topped $5 billion in quarterly sales for the first time in the last quarter. Nvidia Corp. is a well-known company to technology enthusiasts and investors alike. If you are considering buying the stock -- or already own it -- this quarterly review of the key metrics can help you with your own research and decisions about the company as an investment. These updates will also include comparisons of results to other major players in the semiconductor space. Keep in mind that no two companies are alike -- even rivals don't compete in every segment. Any investor needs to do their own research to make informed long-term decisions. Where Nvidia fits in Nvidia (NVDA) is the predominant designer of graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the critical components of graphics cards used for high-end PC gaming and other graphically intense applications. Its main competitor for GPUs is Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), although Intel Corp. (INTC) is working on new products to compete in the space. The actual manufacturing of Nvidia's GPUs is handled by Taiwan Semiconductor Co. Ltd. (2330.TW). Nvidia has also been rapidly increasing its sales of CPUs for data-center processing and making moves to become more competitive in artificial intelligence-related (AI) areas as it waits for regulatory approval of its acquisition of Arm Holdings PLC. Jeremy Owens explains this complicated competition scenario",0.9759
2137,"I have been invested in Nvidia for a lot of years now. I was fortunate to get in for $20 a share back in the day. This company is and will remain the Gold Standard to which all others will be measured. The CEO is a legend that has that rare ability to make everyone around him striving to do their best. He created an exciting work environment where every single employee is given a few paid hours to work on anything they want to. This culture is teeming with excitement and innovation. A rare combination rarely defeated, AMD gave it a solid go at the head to head competition route but quickly realized their lead is insurmountable and comfortably found its lane in taking Intel to the land of “obsoletes” I have only sold a few shares since my original purchase. This company never takes a day off or basks in their wins. No, they go right back to work. The ARM deal is done already, they are attached at the hip and their collaboration only makes it more obvious. These two companies together can solve many of the world’s most important problems but it can also predict the next crisis how best to prepare and have a gamelan the same day! I love this company not because of the money I made but because it is a company that will help to cure cancer and every other bad result we or our workplace receive. Prior to Nvidia’s technological advancements bad news was a likely death sentence for the person or the business. Nvidia offers hope!",0.9898

More EOM are talking up EVs and that would entail the necessary infrastructure need for a buildup of charging stations. And AI, 5G, and cloud are ramping up at a much faster pace on the other side of the pandemic. These events and other positive I may have missed bring me to NVDA potentially getting the approval for Arm Holdings very soon and the entire set up since their previous earnings resulting in, a major quarter ahead of it inclusive of the negative semi shortage become a plus for NVDA over the long term when they spell out the forward-looking guidance.I view NVDA as having their biggest pop in the companies history when they report 05/26/21, with a target price of approx. $650+ on the opening of 05/24/21 possibly closing up the same week well above $700+. In order for my comments to play out, all prior events will have become the catalyst for will be all positive at every stake for NVDA. NVDA's CEO and management somewhat assure me that it is possible without any resistance in my view.In the event, $700 before the end of May may well become the minimum and the confirmation of the Arm Holdings acquisition will be the added catalyst for the shares to go right past $1k+. Soon after Jensen and the board may be left to announce alternatives to increase the dividend or buyback shares or a split. The bottom line will be to continue to raise its valuation while at the same time continue to reward the shareholders.",0.9971

2270,"Oh boy... so many NEWS over the weekend! Exciting news I don't see anyone posting here common AMD_France lol! Let's start! First we had a leak of a new 6nm Zen3+ Rembrandt coming! This is after rumors of Warhol 6nm Zen3+ being cancelled as a stand alone Ryzen pure CPU. Now let's connect this news to Sony upgraded 6nm Playstation rumors AND a new upgraded X570S motherboard! All leaked recently. What do we get? A powerful new mobile Ryzen coming very soon... to be used as desktop and consoles APUs too, just like the rumored Ryzen 5700G which is a Ryzen mobile chip with higher power and AM4 socket desktop use.So now let's understand that TSMC's 6nm is a more sharply definitely Extreme UV lithograph that is compatible with 7nm designs. 5nm requires complete new masks and designs and of course provides substentially higher improvements. Advantage of the 6nm is ability to CONVERT 7nm fab lines quickly to 6nm by ADDING EUV etching machines. EUV results in sharper lines features, hence can get devices dencer closer to each other with less capacity of the metal lines for example. So higher clock speeds and lower power use are possible. The net is all above links are connected and could result in new laptops launching at Computex Taipei June 1st! Lisa Su Computex opening keynote is a big event to show new products related to Computex. Obviously 6nm Rembrandt is...! Connect the dots... you'll see what is coming. . $100+ EASY! $intc doesn't have an answer, their Tiger kitten cannot even compete with past 7nm chips. ADDITIONAL TSMC fab capacity will prevent Intel selling low end chips at a big discount. Just because AMD's are sold out.$nvda will suffer a blow in the mainstream GPUs line as 12 SPs vs previous 8 with faster clock speeds and Zen3+ integration is all it needs for most people. So something outstanding is cooking and soon to be shown! There's much more - check next post... DON'T BE FOOLED !",0.9972

We are experiencing broad-based strength, with all our market platforms driving upside to our initial outlook,” said Colette Kress, executive vice president and chief financial officer of NVIDIA.“Within Data Center we have good visibility, and we expect another strong year. Industries are increasingly using AI to improve their products and services. We expect this will lead to increased consumption of our platform through cloud service providers, resulting in more purchases as we go through the year. Our EGX platform has strong momentum, and we expect this will drive increased revenue from enterprise and edge computing deployments in the second half of the year.“Overall demand remains very strong and continues to exceed supply while our channel inventories remain quite lean. We expect demand to continue to exceed supply for much of this year. We believe we will have sufficient supply to support sequential growth beyond Q1,” she continued.NVIDIA’s market platforms include Gaming, Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. The company also raised its first-quarter revenue estimate for its new CMP product for industrial-scale cryptocurrency mining to $150 million, up from $50 million previously expected.In its Feb. 24 earnings release, NVIDIA had provided a revenue outlook for its first fiscal quarter, ending May 2, of $5.30 billion, plus or minus 2 percent.",0.994

The problem lies with the fact Arm, a tech company, is attempting to be neutral. Being neutral does not work in a competitive industry.The governments reviewing the acquisition will likely consider Nvidia an excellent candidate to push forward their agendas for AI and edge computing. Nvidia has proven itself as a GPU-leader in the data center with 98% of cloud infrastructure-as-a-service using Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPU). There needs to a similar, ubiquitous approach for trillions of edge devices, where more AI-decisions will be made.Therefore, I predict there is a stronger chance that the Nvidia-Arm deal goes through than what the critics believe.This is because the governments reviewing the acquisition will need AI to power their economies. Competition is healthy for the tech market, yet moving forward as an ecosystem owner is also paramount. You cannot block innovation at its most crucial point and I believe Nvidia is best equipped to deliver AI to devices for future development.”",0.9762

However, together we can do many things, and I’ll come back to that. To the beginning of your question, I’m very confident that the regulators will see the wisdom of the transaction. It will provide a surge of innovation. It will create new options for the marketplace. It will allow ARM to be expanded into markets that otherwise are difficult for them to reach themselves. Like many of the partnerships I announced, those are all things bringing AI to the ARM ecosystem, bringing Nvidia’s accelerated computing platform to the ARM ecosystem — it’s something only we and a bunch of computing companies working together can do. The regulators will see the wisdom of it, and our discussions with them are as expected and constructive.

It's a cartel monopoly case obviously saying such before approval of the ARM deal is bad. But nVidia's gotten word it won't be approved so they announced far into the future Grace.Today trying to soften the UK news nVidia's saying that they still ""expect"" the deal closing ""in 2022"" LOL yes until they get final word they can appeal etc but the chance? ZERO! With Grace it's subzero lol. So nVidia's bubble without ARM has no sustainable business. Others can license ARM too and do datacenters CPUs.

The use of such IT infrastructure is increasing owing to the increase in demand for computing power and storage to support the growth in global data traffic.The data center market share growth by the IT infrastructure segment will be faster than the power management system, mechanical construction, general construction, and security solutions segments. The post COVID-19 impact has fast-tracked the demand for IT infrastructure due to the increase in the adoption of cloud services and digitization.Regional Analysis35% of the growth will originate from the North America region.The US is a key market for data centers in North America. Market growth in this region will be faster than the growth of the market in MEA.The increasing adoption of cloud services by enterprises across industries in the US and Canada will facilitate the data center market growth in North America over the forecast period. https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/data-center-market-size-to-cross-over--519-billion-by-2025---technavio-301253991.html",0.9974

3098,"$700 target price reiterated by Merrill analyst:Q1 beat, expect sequential growth throughout 2021We reit. Buy ahead of FQ1 (AprQ) earnings on May 26 after market close. At analyst daylast month, NVDA positively pre’d Q1 above guide of $5.3bn. We now expect Q1 sales of $5.45bn ($50mn/1% above cons.) incl. $150mn of CMP (crypto SKU) vs. $50mn guide and modest upside to gaming, pro viz, data center. Importantly, while supply still tight, NVDA said they have sufficient supply for QoQ growth post Q1. For JulQ we see 1% QoQ growth driven by seasonal mid-single digit data center growth, though sub-seasonal -5% gaming (seasonal +20%) after strong Q1E (+14% QoQ vs. seasonal -25%). We expect stronger growth in OctQ (+5% QoQ) on return to seasonal (Oct seasonally strongest qtr) with improvements in supply (6+ mos after TSMC capex ramp). Thus, we raise CY21/22E sales by 3%/1% and EPS by 5%/2% to $13.40/$15.57 and keep our PO at $700, on 44x vs. 45x prior given contraction in sector multiples, still inline with EPS growth.",0.9928

3600,"Something to read and digest....""The company is set to release the January quarter results today after the bell, and Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann expects Nvidia to post a “beat and raise.”“We see the January quarter being driven by strength in Gaming, Professional Visualization, and a continued recovery in Automotive offset by a sequential decline in Data Center,” the 5-star analyst said. “While the outlook will likely see continued adoption of Ampere and the recently announced Ampere featured laptops, strength in AI and cloud computing verticals, better than expected Gaming, and Automotive growth.”Mosesmann expects sales in the longer 14-week quarter to be above his and the Street’s forecast for low single-digit sequential growth, with EPS also coming in higher than his $2.80 forecast and the consensus estimate of $2.81.Nvidia’s main breadwinner, Gaming, should rise mid-single-digits quarter-over-quarter, driven by “continued ramp of the RTX 30 series, products, work-from-home demand dynamics, and game console SoCs.”Of the company’s fast-growing division, Data Center, the analyst anticipates a cooling off period with a pause to its rally and a sequential low single-digits decline. The outlook for the segment is a key area to watch on the earnings call, where Mosesmann will be keen to learn about the likely duration of supply chain shortages, which the analyst believes will continue beyond F2Q21, and “controls on cryptocurrency mining using GPUs.”Additionally, over the next several quarters, the data processing unit will continue to be a focal point and is noted as another tailwind. All in all, Mosesmann makes no bones about his long-term prospects for the GPU heavyweight.“We see NVDA as the best managed and strategically positioned semiconductor company,” the analyst summed up.""",0.9908

Even if NVidia just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem.

There are many to choose from.✓ option your stock If you are concerned about capital gains or have chosen to hang on long-term.✓buy the March 29 $50 Puts and close that position at 25% gain before next Friday (control your greed and take your profits even though it will probably double this coming week) You will see a minimum of 25% appreciation in those puts by Tuesday at 10: 45 at latest.This is not a pitch to improve my personal position It is out of concern for those who are too attached to this particular stock and face steep losses.

4573,"As disability awards grow, so do concerns over the veracity of veterans’ PTSD claimsBy Alan ZaremboOctober 16, 2014The 49-year-old veteran explained that he suffered from paranoia in crowds, nightmares and unrelenting flashbacks from the Iraq war. He said he needed his handgun to feel secure and was worried that he would shoot somebody.The symptoms were textbook post-traumatic stress disorder.But Robert Moering, the psychologist conducting the disability examination at a Veterans Affairs hospital in Tampa, Fla., suspected the veteran was exaggerating. Hardly anybody had so many symptoms of PTSD so much of the time.As disability awards for PTSD have grown nearly fivefold over the past 13 years, so have concerns that many veterans might be exaggerating or lying to win benefits. Moering, a former Marine, estimates that roughly half of the veterans he evaluates for the disorder exaggerate or fabricate symptoms.Depending on severity, veterans with PTSD can receive up to $3,000 a month tax-free, making the disorder the biggest contributor to the growth of a disability system in which payments have more than doubled to $49 billion since 2002.“It’s an open secret that a large chunk of patients are flat-out malingering,” said Christopher Frueh, a University of Hawaii psychologist who spent 15 years treating PTSD in the VA system.Diagnosing PTSD can be difficult in the best of circumstances. Experts have long debated how to define the condition. One person can suffer crippling anxiety from an experience that would not faze someone else.Assessing PTSD becomes even more difficult in a VA system that gives veterans a financial incentive to appear as sick as possible, former and current VA mental health clinicians said. The number of veterans on the disability rolls for the disorder has climbed from 133,745 to more than 656,000 over the last 13 years.",0.61

Gaming has become the world's largest media and entertainment industry, and will grow to be much larger. And again gamers will create, will play, they'll learn, they'll connect. The medium of gaming can host any type of game and eventually evolve with the countless metaverses.So I'm for placed on for work. Gaming at simultaneously a great technology and a great business driver for our company. This year, we also closed our Mellanox acquisition and successfully united the amazing talent of our companies. Combined we possess deep expertise in all aspects of computing and networking to drive the architecture of modern data centers. Crowd computing and hyperscalers have transformed the data center into the new unit of computing. Chips on servers are just elements of the data center scale computers now.With our expertise in AI computing full stack accelerated computing, our deep network to computing expertise and cloud to edge platforms, Nvidia is helping to drive a great computer industry transformation. And our planned acquisition of Arm, the world's most popular and energy efficient CPU company will help position and video to lead in the age of AI. This year was extraordinary.The pandemic will pass, but the world has been changed forever. Technology adoption is accelerating across every industry. Companies and products need to be more remote and autonomous. This will drive data centers, AI and robotics. This underlies the accelerated adoption of Nvidia’s technology. The urgency to digitize, automate and accelerate innovation has never been higher. We are ready. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thanks a lot.",0.9969

Let's start with Jensen Huang and Nvidia. The quarter just reported was superb, as usual, but the conference call brought out lingering fears of 2018, where Nvidia ended up with some slowing end markets, crypto and data center. The latter soon accelerated, but because of an oddity of not knowing whether its cards were being used in gaming or mining, the company saw an inventory glut when bitcoin crashed.This time around the data center spend is accelerating, because of the move to the cloud, and the company has a real hand on crypto, which could be a good business and Nvidia will have its own Ethereum mining chips that can be monitored. The market was wrong on both counts. Can Nvidia close on the Arm Holdings deal giving it the best full suite of chips for every fast growing market? After doubting Jensen on the ability to close on Mellanox, I am not going to make the same mistake this time around. This stock is way too cheap versus next year's numbers-not this year's-and it's a buy.""",0.9897

This matters because they are held hostage to the same chip crunch that everyone is fighting right now. A chip shortage means NVDA cannot get enough chips to build their final products, and it also means paying higher prices to Samsung and TSMC who are the fabs that actually produce their chips. It also means they will have to commit to larger order sizes, and build more inventory in the future. These are certainly headwinds to this stock.

Qualcomm has paid their share of anti-trust fines, and both Microsoft and Google have their history of buying up other companies and trying to crush competition. Aside from pushing AI forward - Nvidia is already a leader in AI without Arm - they'll be competing with Intel. As for Intel, they're getting into graphics cards. Nvidia and Intel are also competing in cloud data. The real battle shaping up here seems to be between Nvidia and Intel.Jensen has said that he would maintain Arm's neutral licensing model. Moreover, not only has he said he would maintain Arm's current operations in the UK, but expand it. The Nvidia website states:""Opening the AI research facility for collaboration with UK industry leaders addressing the world’s most pressing challenges.""""Expanding research partners within the UK through research fellowships and partnerships via the AI research centre.""""Helping UK start-ups grow through access to the Arm supercomputer, NVIDIA experts, technical training and marketing promotion.""Seems pretty clear that he would agree to stipulations that would address most concerns. As for export control, which would be China's concern, Arm CEO Simon Seegar stated that it is ""...governed by where the technology is created in the first place. That doesn't change with the change of ownership of Arm.""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8HTfQi548The US would not be able to restrict China's access to Arm because it is British. In other words, this is a non-issue. The US could ask the UK to restrict Chinese access, but that's politics and could happen with or without the deal. The US and UK are close allies.

Me, a few years back after downsizing ,and being retired looked around for some good growth stocks to enhance my remaining years found NVDA and a few others. By remaining long with NVDA and its 1,500 shares my profits to date exceed over $700,000. Could I have increased that gain by playing 'shorts'over those few years? I doubt it and the stress and risk of wrong short term decisions over that time would no doubt have destroyed the joy of retirement......better to head to the casino as at least it would have been fun playing. Anyway, longs stay firm as NVDA is a great company with the best products. AMD, had some of their stock but quickly realized that their products, mainly CPU's have become almost obsolete and they have hung on and gained market share only because lousy management by Intel allowed it.

Even if NVidia just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem.

MMs causing weak hands to sell because they want to close out options cheap before ER5. MMs shaking prices to rinse and repeat what happened in March 2020. 6.

5752,"NVIDIA Unveils AI Enterprise Software Suite to Help Every Industry Unlock the Power of AITuesday, March 9, 2021Runs on VMware vSphere; Optimized, Certified and Supported by NVIDIA; Hundreds of Thousands of Customers in World’s Largest Industries Can Now Adopt NVIDIA AI Enterprise at ScaleSANTA CLARA, Calif., March 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced NVIDIA AI Enterprise, a comprehensive software suite of enterprise-grade AI tools and frameworks optimized, certified and supported by NVIDIA, exclusively with VMware vSphere 7 Update 2, separately announced today.Through a first-of-its-kind industry collaboration to develop an AI-Ready Enterprise platform, NVIDIA teamed with VMware to virtualize AI workloads on VMware vSphere with NVIDIA AI Enterprise. The offering gives enterprises the software required to develop a broad range of AI solutions, such as advanced diagnostics in healthcare, smart factories for manufacturing, and fraud detection in financial services.With the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite, IT professionals at the hundreds of thousands of enterprises that use vSphere for compute virtualization can now support AI with the same tools they use to manage large-scale data centers and hybrid cloud environments. The NVIDIA software suite provides scale-out, multi-node, AI application performance on vSphere that is indistinguishable from bare-metal servers.“Until now, the world has run AI on bare-metal servers,” said Justin Boitano, vice president and general manager of Enterprise and Edge Computing at NVIDIA. “NVIDIA AI Enterprise enables customers to reduce AI model development time from 80 weeks to just eight weeks, and allows them to deploy and manage advanced AI applications on VMware vSphere with the same scale-out, record-breaking NVIDIA accelerated computing performance that’s possible on bare metal.”“Every enterprise is exploring how to modernize their infrastructure to meet the demands of AI applications,” said Lee Caswell, vice president of marketing for the Cloud Platform Business Unit at VMware. “With NVIDIA AI Enterprise and vSphere 7 Update 2, VMware customers are now able to fast-track AI in their virtualized data centers and easily deploy certified, AI-ready infrastructure for their modern apps.”Powering Advanced AI at Enterprise ScaleAmong the first to use NVIDIA AI Enterprise for vSphere is Optum Technology, part of UnitedHealth Group.“AI plays an increasingly important role in the data-driven services Optum provides for United Healthcare,” said Justin Potuznik, senior principal engineer at Optum Technology. “With NVIDIA’s AI Enterprise software and infrastructure running on our VMware vSphere environment, we’ll be able to power our modern application workloads and efficiently deploy AI at enterprise scale.”Flexible AI Infrastructure for the Hybrid CloudNVIDIA AI Enterprise provides compatibility for a broad set of accelerated CUDA applications, AI frameworks, pre-trained models and software development kits running in the hybrid cloud. Optimizations enable workloads to scale across multiple nodes to support large deep learning training models with full GPU virtualization.To power the applications in NVIDIA AI Enterprise, VMware vSphere 7 Update 2 is now certified for NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs on NVIDIA-Certified Systems, which include high-volume servers from Dell Technologies, HPE, Lenovo and Supermicro. With this certification comes direct customer support from NVIDIA for vSphere customers that acquire a license for NVIDIA AI Enterprise.NVIDIA has also certified vSphere as the only compute virtualization software to provide hypervisor support for live migration with NVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU technology, which allows each A100 GPU to be partitioned into up to seven instances at the hardware level to maximize efficiency for workloads of all sizes.Additionally, select NVIDIA ConnectX adapters are now certified for VMware vSAN over RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access), which offloads CPU communication tasks to boost application performance and improve infrastructure returns on investment.NVIDIA AI Enterprise is available as a perpetual license at $3,595 per CPU socket. Enterprise Business Standard Support for NVIDIA AI Enterprise is $899 annually per license. Customers can apply for early access to NVIDIA AI Enterprise as they plan their upgrades to VMware vSphere 7 Update 2.For more information on bringing AI to VMware hybrid clouds, read the NVIDIA blog and the VMware vSphere 7 Update 2 release blog. Free registration is now open for GTC 2021, where NVIDIA and VMware will present on bringing AI to every enterprise.",0.9991

I can not believe that something like these days can happen when people are rewarding companies that are not fundamentally sound and punish stocks that are fundamentally sound. I remember when some analysts did that because some did not do their research or wants to promote a stock or were late in getting in but those things did not last because people can see what is wrong and they can tell when things go fishy. I think this thing that is happening now is worse because it involves a lot of people who gang up on few stocks with some using margin to get in and selling stocks like NVDA LRCX KLAC APPL AMD ADBE and most tech stocks like semis cloud and others who have been reporting strong earnings for years and have very little debt and some with no debt.

They have acquired Mellanox and developed the DGX A100 for datacenter that has reduced the costs for major cloud companies by 1/10th while running at 1/20th the power with partners including Microsoft, VMware and Redhat. The Mellanox deal has also allowed Nvidia to offer Cyber Security Solutions and expand their datacenter marketshare. Nvidia has announced over 70 gaming laptops that will use their RTX GPU's in 2021 alone with their RTX 3090 being the most powerful consumer GPU on the planet (the A100 being the most powerful DPU on the planet). Nvidia is attempting to close the deal with ARM that will effectively allow them to ditch AMD and produce their own CPU's for self driving, datacenter, compute and mobile. The deal would bring in some of the most intelligent semiconductor architecture designers on the planet that helped Apple become what it is today back in the Acorn Computers days. Nvidia GPUs are included in 8 of the 10 fastest industrial supercomputers in the world, which speaks to the abilities of Nvidia engineers if the ARM deal falls through. Nvidia is in the Nintendo Switch that sold over 3.3 million units worldwide in the first 11 weeks. Demand due to Covid and the emergence of AI has created the best environment for GPUs on record with the demand to continue for the foreseeable future with supply struggling to keep pace.Bear case: No one in the future is going to drive, use the internet or game because everyone will become Amish.

In response to a question about the shortages, Huang countered that the company hadn't experienced a shortage of supply, but rather an abundance of demand:""The 3080 and 3090 have a demand issue, not a supply issue,"" said Huang. ""The demand issue is that it is much much greater than we expected — and we expected really a lot.""""Retailers will tell you they haven't seen a phenomenon like this in over a decade of computing.

6709,"While a good deal of NVIDIA’s success in servers over the last decade has of course come from their proficient GPUs, as a business NVIDIA these days is much more than a fabless GPU designer. With more software engineers than hardware engineers on staff, it’s software and ecosystem plays that have really cemented NVIDIA’s position as the top GPU manufacturer, and created a larger market for their GPUs. At the same time, it’s these ecosystem plays that have allowed NVIDIA to build a profit-printing machine, diversifying beyond just GPU sales and moving into systems, software, support, and other avenues.To that end, NVIDIA this morning is formally rolling out a new ecosystem play aimed at high-end deep learning servers, which the company is branding as NVIDIA-Certified Systems. Soft-launched back in the fall, today the company is giving the program a more proper introduction, detailing the program and announcing some of the partners. Under NVIDIA’s plan, going forward customers can opt to buy NVIDIA-Certified systems if they want an extra guarantee on system performance and reliability, as well as opt in to buying support contracts to get access to direct, full-stack technical support from NVIDIA... https://www.anandtech.com/show/16452/nvidia-launches-server-certification-program-offering-direct-technical-support",0.9927

The Nasdaq 100 is off 7% from its February 16 high, while the S&P 500 is down 3% over that same time period.The 10-year US Treasury note spiked to a cycle high of more than 1.50% on Thursday, and interest rate volatility saw its biggest spike since March of 2020, as measured by the CBOE Interest Rate Volatility Index.But according to Lee, the volatility in interest rates feels ""capitulatory,"" which could lead to gains ahead for stocks.Lee highlighted that soaring interest rate volatility, coupled with an extended 30-week rate of change, occured on the following dates: June 24, 2013, October 15, 2014, March 19, 2020, and February 24, 2021.What's significant about the first three of these dates is that after each of these instances it marked the bottom in the stock market ""to the day,"" Lee said.

For grid batteries, fast and accurate modeling of batteries on NVIDIA EGX are planned to increase battery utilization, reduce the risk of thermal events and extend battery life.

There aren't enough chips for products ranging from cars to the graphics cards made by Nvidia, and far too many buyers.Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the demand for Nvidia's (ticker: NVDA) videogame chips has far outpaced the number of consumers seeking the cards that include them. Prices remain high in secondary markets, reportedly double what the company recommends, well over a quarter after the Ampere-based chips became available.As irked as gamers -- or cryptocurrency miners, another group of buyers -- might be by the lack of supply, the surging demand has driven up forecasts for fiscal fourth-quarter sales in Nvidia's videogame segment to $2.39 billion.
