Factors such as higher employee wages, free delivery, and promotional activity continue to be a drag on Target’s bottom line. In addition, the retailer also expects to see continued pressure on its EBIT due to ongoing investments in both digital and physical stores going forward. In fact, the company has provided a disappointing outlook for the holiday season for the same reason. Our estimates for the company’s valuation assume a slight decline in Target’s revenue per square feet and gross profit margin levels going forward."" (Forbes)Gee is this bad news?

Thus, the store chain is subject to a 1.5 million strong boycott of former customers, including myself and my family.

102,"As the month of October rolls on, some consider it a pretty scary time - especially at Target, where a frightening restroom and fitting room policy continues to put women and children at risk.Since the spring, AFA has been encouraging shoppers to #BoycottTarget after the retailer publicized its dangerous and controversial restroom and fitting room policy - one that alienated families, along with more than 1.4 million shoppers who have signed the pledge. And since the boycott began, the news has not been good for Target, especially after the corporation announced dismal second-quarter earnings. Likewise, Target stock has dropped to 68.41, a decrease of more than 18 percent since April 19, when the stock closed at 83.98.While the American Family Association and our values are in line with celebrating harvest-style festivals rather than Halloween, we realize that many American shoppers will be spending a great deal of money this month on decorating, party and treat items.The one-million mark for the #BoycottTarget signatures was significant, and Target took note but did nothing to protect women and girls in their restrooms and fitting rooms. Now, AFA is encouraging those who haven't yet signed the pledge so we can reach 1.5 million - and perhaps Target will finally respond to these growing numbers since their revenues and foot traffic have declined nationwide.As we have stated many times, our worries do not stem from fear of the transgender community, but rather, from both the real and potential threat that predators and voyeurs, or anyone with evil intentions, would take advantage of the Target bathroom policy to harm women and children - and we have plenty of incidents to show that they have.In a recent Action Alert to its more than one million friends and supporters, AFA outlined just 10 examples that show why Target should immediately rescind its dangerous policy and keep men out of women's bathrooms and dressing rooms.As frightening incidents at Target stores continue, AFA is asking shoppers to take action in several ways this month: Sign the #BoycottTarget pledge. Encourage family and friends to sign the pledge, too, as boycott numbers climb to 1.5 million. Voice your concerns on Target's Facebook page. Call Target to politely let its executives know you’ve signed the #BoycottTarget pledge - Guest Relations, (800) 440-0680, option 1, then 1 again.

As for your question, given my understanding of SNAP, I wouldn't recommend buying it as a long term investment but it should see a short term pop soon.

TGT is growing it's year over #'s and is a pleasure to shop at without that warehouse feel.

But does it ever occur to you that the films he took of women undressing were most likely downloaded to his computer, from whence they quite llikely were distributed across the internet? This is hardly the first time a pervert has been caught in a ""unisex"" restroom (or shower) filming girls. But you don't really care about that, now do you?

The department had also responded to the same location on Saturday, January 19th, when the male suspect had committed the same act in a fitting room with the door open and fled in a gold Jaguar after leaving the store. Based on surveillance footage from Saturday’s incident, officers believed the suspect to be Lewis Foreman (23). Foreman once again fled the store in a gold Jaguar prior to police arrival.

I would argue that Tgt deserves a pe of 25 to be valued fairly because it is growing it's sales faster than Wmt and does not really compare to a bulk item store like Cost. I believe it will grow into a 25 pe by next year. I also believe Tgt will increase it's earnings to $7 per share. So taking 25 x $7 = $175.

It is very much a cult, with very little room for independent or critical thinking. If you had told people like Ark or Dave several years ago that the cult would demand that men be allowed into ladies rooms or that two men should be ""married"", they would have called you a conservative crack pot. But one day they woke up and that's what the cult leaders were telling them, so all of the sudden that's what they believed. The question is, what will the cult leaders think of next? There are two main theories of Trump’s support. One is that a large minority of Americans — 40 percent, give or take — are racist idiots. This theory is at least tacitly endorsed by the Democratic Party and the mainstream liberal media. The other is that a large majority of this large minority are good citizens with intelligible and legitimate opinions, who so resent being regarded as racist idiots that they’ll back Trump almost regardless. They may not admire the man, but he’s on their side, he vents their frustration, he afflicts the people who think so little of them — and that’s good enough. It’s disappointing that Charlottesville hasn’t changed their minds — but then it hasn’t changed my mind either. I still think the first theory is absurd and the second theory basically correct. . . . This sense that democratic politics is futile if not downright dangerous now infuses the worldview of the country’s cultural and intellectual establishment. Trump is routinely accused of being authoritarian and anti-democratic, despite the fact that he won the election and, so far, has been checked at every point and has achieved almost nothing in policy terms. (He might wish he were an authoritarian, but he sure hasn’t been allowed to function as one.) Many of his critics, on the other hand, are anti-democratic in a deeper sense: They appear to believe that a little less than half the country doesn’t deserve the vote. The second theory — the correct theory — is a terrible indictment of the Democratic Party and much of the media. Why aren’t the intelligible and legitimate opinions of that large minority given a hearing? Why must their views be bundled reflexively into packages labelled “bigotry” and “stupidity”? Why can’t this large minority of the American people be accorded something other than pity or scorn?",0.9943

The weight of this first-hand testimony, along with supporting government documentation and other evidence, established without any doubt the reality of these phenomena. These individuals offered to give sworn testimony to Congress about their encounters, but Congress has refused to hear them. Instead for 60 years, the government has covered up and lied to the American people about the existence of UFOs.Here is a link to the press conference, please watch and pass on!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-iaV_XW9iE",0.9917

To take advantage of Target's sale, shoppers had to cut out a coupon from Sunday's weekly and take it to Target's stores. Online orders automatically applied the discount.The unusual sale tactic came one week after Target reported a massive 7.2% drop in sales in the second quarter, following the launch of the AFA #BoycottTarget campaign.Target CEO Brian Cornell admitted in a conference call with media that traffic is way down and that sales are hurting. ""In the second quarter, our No. 1 challenge was traffic, which affected sales in all of our merchandise categories,"" he said.Although he did not mention the AFA boycott by name, 1.4 million people have pledged to Mr. Cornell that they will not shop at Target.TAKE ACTIONIf you haven't already, sign the pledge to boycott Target now!

The man ran away before police could arrive.According to news reports, the incident happened in the middle of the afternoon on Sunday, March 25.No Target employee questioned the man or attempted to stop him from entering the women's restroom because Target’s official policy allows men free and unrestricted access. This policy has resulted in over a dozen crimes being committed by sexual predators taking advantage of it.""It's very sad. Children are innocent,"" Stanley Hughley, a shopper at the Target store, said. ""However old the pedophile was, it's wrong. It’s pure evil no matter how you look at it.""As we have stated many times, our worries stem from both the real and potential threat that predators and voyeurs, or anyone with evil intentions, would take advantage of the Target bathroom policy to harm women and children - and we have plenty of incidents to show that they have.AFA has outlined just 10 examples that show why Target should immediately rescind its dangerous policy and keep men out of women's bathrooms and dressing rooms. As long as Target continues to allow men free and unrestricted access into women's dressing rooms and restrooms, these sexual violations against women and little girls will continue to occur.TAKE ACTIONThere are still people you know who are unfamiliar with Target's dangerous policy. Will you help spread the warning and let your family and friends know about the Target boycott? Forward this information to friends and family. Invite them to sign the boycott pledge at www.afa.net/target. Call Target headquarters at 612-304-6073 and personally let them know you are boycotting their stores.

Please help us reach 1.6 million supporters!The Target boycott, launched in April 2016, is causing a significant drop in foot traffic to the store. Effects of the boycott are clear in Target’s financial report released February 28. The report indicated a dramatic drop in Target’s sales and earningsduring October, November, and December. This bad news for Target resulted in the company’s stock value dropping 13 percenton the day of the report.Target, however, remains willfully blind to the link between the boycott and financial loss, but this blindness should not persist. Investors will hardly allow a politically correct bathroom policy based on a minority opinion to sink Target’s profits further. Target investors must be aware that a strong majority of Americans believe the use of restrooms and dressing rooms should be linked to a person's biological sex We must keep the pressure on Target.Somebody needs to tell this to Snopes.com, the fact-checking site so many people depend on for honesty. The site's appraisal of the Target boycott is well off the mark. Snopes.com is simply repeating Target's false claims that the boycott is having no effect on the company.The Snopes.com story includes a quote from Target's public relations manager Erika Winkels saying the boycott has had no effect on them: ""We have made it clear over time that we've seen no material impact to the business based on the bathroom policy. We don't have anything new or different to share.""FACT: Despite Target's denial, the boycott is dealing a crippling financial blow to the company. Since it was launched in April 2016, Target has seen a significant drop in foot traffic to their stores. Effects of the boycott are also clear in Target's financial report released February 28.

Do they really think the average shopper is on an investment message board trying to decide if they want to shop at Target? What is their goal in all of this. Also, posting stories of incidents in a changing room area does not prove your point. Dressing rooms at Target, and pretty much every store in this country, are for men and women. Also notice how in every article posted, Target has contacted the authorities and worked with law enforcement to catch those responsible. So, those stories never prove your point.Every post by Sarah and DD and other anti-Target posters only make those actually reading this message board that have invested in Target that much more loyal to the brand.

2079,I still find it hard to believe that Target’s management and more shockingly the so called stock experts still are not willing to admit that the transgender bathroom policy and subsequent boycott are a major factor in the stock’s decline. Nearly one and a half million people signed up for the boycott of Target. That is just the people who signed it. This doesn’t include the people who just quietly walked away from Target. Target stock was on an upward trend until 19 July 2016. On that day the stock closed at 83.98 and Target announced its new transgender friendly bathroom policy. In the wake of the announcement a conservative group announced a boycott of Target and the stock started to drop. The CEO did not care and made excuses for the drop like Daffy Duck on the bridge of the Titanic claiming that the water in the boat was from a flooded toilet. The liberals attacked Chic Fil A because of statements made by the owner about his view of marriage. Chic Fil A sees a huge increase in sales. Hobby Lobby was attacked by the left for objecting to providing abortives and contraceptives in its health care plan. They to saw a huge outpouring of support and increased sales. Target decides to side with a very small minority of the population at the expense of the safety and comfort of the rest of the population and sees its sales and stock drop. But because it’s not politically correct to admit its policy had any affect they stick their head in the sand and try to fix the leaking toilet ignoring the hole caused by the iceberg.,0.8114

Target is a discount retailer. It's business model consists of buying mass produced cheap merchandise from China, with a little value added by a good design team, marked up but sold cheap in huge stores located in low-cost areas. But now, because he has driven away his core demographic, he's going to change the whole operation to a new business model: smaller stores in urban areas.But the problem here is that urban stores are very expensive to run.

They saw a problem in their strategy and revised, then invested in it. The + more I see in this stock is the user interface (online and app), obviously the App is amazing and the best in retail. The other big plus that I am counting a big return on is using their stores, not just as physical stores, but dubbing them as distribution centers. The big amazon takeover talk is only because amazon would buy target and do this to their stores. Target would have a major win and send the stock to over $100 if they can successfully use their super targets and large footprint stores as stores and distribution centers to allow for same day - 1 day deliveries in the future. This would attract a lot more online orders and be a stronger efficient use of their space. A lot of work still to be made on that front, but they need to beat amazon to that punch while they can.

3358,"Chewy – HEEL!Chewy, Inc. ($CHWY/NYSE) is a recent IPO that has all the makings of a train wreck for minority shareholders.The Company raised several hundred million dollars in its initial public offering of 46,500,000 @ $22/share; however, the bulk of proceeds were taken by Chewy’s owner Petsmart and sponsors. Petsmart maintains majority economic and voting control through super-voting shares and will be free to sell more of its 273,500,000 shares on December 15, 2019 when its lock-up agreement expires.The stock is buoyed by an overheated market and incomplete and misunderstood information, including inflated e-tailer comparable valuations such as ETSY ($ETSY/12x sales) and Amazon ($AMZN/50x EPS), a minimal beat to the guidance given in the Company’s SEC filings (reported as a miss by news services), a belief that auto-reload revenues (67% of sales) are sustainable into perpetuity (in fact cancelable at any time), views that repeat customers will continue to increase spend (the law of large numbers catching up now), and an overall avoidance (or ignorance) of the significant competitive threats around including WalMart’s ($WMT) launch into the pet care space with thousands of in-store vet clinics with PetIQ (VetIQ of $PETQ).Repeat business and rising average spend per customer has been a substantial driver of growth, but we believe this trend by existing customers is now peaking and the law of large numbers will decelerate top line growth. Note that management’s first post-IPO guidance calls for low single-digit % top line growth in the next three months from the most recent report.The Company is free cash flow negative and has little leverage in its operating model especially in a commodity pet food/products world demanding next day shipping from the likes of $AMZN, $WMT and $TGT. The market is characterized by substantial price competition which shows no sign of abating. Despite the fallacy f the argument, pet owners’ loyalty to their animals does not translate to loyalty to $CHWY products and services or its brand. With less than $150MM in cash and burning funds for the foreseeable future, we believe there is little room for error for this online kibbler as it navigates its way to the world of the “big dogs.”There is no fundamental basis for an online pet food company to trade at $13BN valuation or 3x sales while burning cash. We recommend investors SELL $CHWY based on an IPO that has essentially taken a bankrupt company public while allowing its control shareholder to unload hundreds of millions of dollars of paper in an unprecedented sign that the overall market is in a “second dot.com bubble”. Our price target is $11, which represents 1x annual revenues of $4.4BN based on roughly 400MM shares outstanding. That said, current Internet multiples are inflated, and in a normalized environment, we estimate CHWY shares are more fairly valued at 2x gross profit or 0.5x-0.6x sales, which represents an EV of $2.2BN-$2.5 or $5-$6 per share.",0.9978

I've held all since and added to the position for the first time in years when it dipped to the mid-$50's last year. While I didn't hit the yearly low, I'm still happy with my timing. I expected earnings were going to be impacted due to higher spending, and quite honestly I'd have been disappointed if they weren't. TGT should be spending heavily right now. They need to do what's necessary to compete with AMZN and WMT for the long term. I think they're making wise decisions. I have no plans to add shares at current levels, but if it somehow dropped below $60 again, I'd happily add to my position, continue to reinvest my shares and feel comfortable for the long term. If you don't hold shares, sub-$70 is a good spot to start averaging in, in my opinion.BTW... I still believe there's a real chance AMZN will acquire TGT at some point. This would essentially complete AMZN's brick and mortar footprint and give them the flexibility to do just about what ever they want to do in U.S. retail.

I suggest that we harass him/er about this at every possible chance.

3475,"Too much credit for AMZN as the problem for Bricks and Clicks Retailers like Target. There was a time when the company focused on the customer and what they really wanted and they delivered against that vision. Target had a pedigree and genesis that was far different from any other mass merchant or discounter due to the parent which was Dayton Hudson one of the best regional department stores of the era; Many Key executives came from there and later many key executives would returm to Dayton to move them along as well. The products were far better than Walmart, Kmart,Zayre et al. Strong pricing and exciting promotion. Walmart evolved and improved and challenged Target through pricing ( every day low ) and rn a more cluttered, low cost structure as Target always could be relied on to delivery a clean, well light store with clean polished floors and excellent value both in staple and promotional emphasis that was a leadership position in the entire retail industry. Buyers and marketers were challenged to delivery high taste product lines in home and fashion. Outstanding seasonal merchandising with a tuned assortment and introduced always with impeccable timing. Pricing on all key items was ensured to be equal to or lower than any retailer in the market place. And the customer responded awarding them strong comp sales growth and new store prototypes to maintain a role of leadership in the industry. What happened ? As the company prospered under many CEO transitions as there was a Targay way of producing an entire package that was pleasing to the consumer trade while engineering a good return on investment. The company was feeling the pressure on gross margin rate and decided to expand the snack food area and use it as a promotional vehicle to draw traffic. Not a bad strategy and it worked for a while very nicely. Then the company over time decided to increase margins in departments and categories where they had developed distinctive competitive edges. Later fresh food was added to further drive traffic. It worked for some period of time but the pricing and reliance of trend and seasonal merchandising eroded slowly over this time line while others who were followers continued to improve . The once sharp edge began to be dull. Not bad but no real leadership. Quality and value in apparel began to spin down with reliance on some B level Brands and designers entered the mix. Margins continued to erode while the once successful strategy of convenience,basic, power and seasonal became obscure as a new generation of strategic marketing and merchandise management moved into higher positions. Still a nice clean store with some nice products not so well defined in terms of a merchant ego of this is what we believe . It is missing and sales are spiraling down as Walmart and now Amazon have picked them off on pricing. The SKU arithmetic has made it very hard to find any really power assortments and now adjacencies look like they are an experiment to see how confusing they can make the store to shop. I am s former Target Executive and I loved the company but I see the thinking along marketing and merchandising so eroded that it is not hard to understand why Canada failed. There is an umbrella that still exists here under the powerful brand image that has been established over the years. The mechanics were never established in Canada so there was no hard earned brand casting marketing sunshine over the Bullseye .I went today and spent 3 hours in my local Target. I b ought only $32 worth of merchandise but mostly non competitive priced and a package of pork. The Home and seasonal areas were in a word uninspiring. House wares was very good in content and adjacency. Fashion adjacencies were excellent. Better than the product in my opinion.Pricing was pretty much way over the market even in food. Store was not very busy when considering that Sunday has a new flyer out. The cashier was very nice and really the only employee I had any interaction with and that is neither good or bad but just a fact.There was a stocker in grocery who really had no interest in engagement. Big problems ahead as well as in their wake. The strategy that demands price as the primary driver is in trouble but then if you choose to ignore price as a driver altogether , service,convenience, assortments, trend must make up for the highly visible price driver and I witnessed nothing that was a big enough differentiator to provide adequate off set. I can tell you with great certainty that the new everyday low price strategy did not work when Target implemented in Atlanta in the early 1980 era and has less of an opportunity to succeed today as the plant , product and people can not deliver against this format well enough. The customers want to be excited about what is new and on trend and how Target will once again deliver against that. Not enough theater and too much vanilla along with a grocery mix that can not achieve enough traffic for the rest of the store to thrive. If you wnt to sell apparel then make it stand on its' own. Done. I am sorry for the length of this but retail is my life and it hurts to see this once great enterprise rush to the middle.",0.9997

Check Walmart, Costco, and Kroger’s apps in the App Store. Say goodbye to paper shopping lists when you can have it in your app on the phone.

But Kennedy, who famously noted that ""a rising tide lifts all boats,"" insisted tax cuts would generate broad-based growth.Congress finally approved the tax cuts in early 1964, three months after Kennedy's assassination. The following fiscal year, the federal budget deficit did indeed shrink. Stock investors loved it.
