21,"luis2 days agoMARKET ""ZOMBIE""The ""zombie"" market created by the FED continues its artificial bull run in an unflappable way, without a doubt the indexes have lost contact with the economic reality and the FED has created a market addicted to permanent stimuli that will no longer be able to return to normality.I have no doubt that the markets will rise as long as the creation of money by the FED persists, the balance of the Federal Reserve is increasing and will continue to increase in order to maintain the market.The ultra expansive free money monetary policy (which only benefits a very small group of people) is causing an unprecedented accumulation of unproductive debt, in reality, the investment of companies is at historical lows, companies are simply accumulating debt and then use the money to buy back their own shares.The increase in inequality is increasing every day, the working class continues to make the greatest sacrifices.The magically created money policy of the FED is holding back productivity growth because companies no longer have to dedicate themselves to producing, they no longer have to be profitable for their share prices to rise, I repeat, now they simply acquire debt to buy your own actions.Although the FED denies it, we all know that infinite QE has only served to force indices to rise.Now, the big question many investors ask themselves is: why have the mountains of free money magically printed not achieved a general increase in the price level of goods and services? The answer is very simple: the real reason to keep inflation under control is that all the money created does not reach the pockets of the working class, that is, consumers are the only ones who can generate an increase in the demand for goods and services, that exceeds the capacity of companies and consequently generate inflation, but the reality is that most of that money has served to force the indexes to rise and favor a very small group of the population, remember that 5% have close to 90% of the stock market, therefore it will be difficult to see significant increases in inflation.We are in a delicate situation where the working class will continue to make the greatest sacrifices for the benefit of a very small and select group.June 07, 2020",0.9663

It said it has physical-distancing guidelines and routing systems on arrival and departure and on board, and that it will manage capacities at public spaces such as restaurants, bars, theaters, and sports and wellness areas.AIDA also said it will equip its ships with Covid-19 testing kits and have around-the-clock medical care on board.The resumptions come as AIDA's parent company is redeploying certain vessels due to delays in ship deliveries amid the pandemic, causing sailing cancellations through as late as May 2021 in the U.S.",0.9559

33,"Comments from the US Government Coronavirus Task Force March 10th (link to video below):1. Noone from the particularly vulnerable population is going out on a cruise in the near future.2. If someone gets seriously ill on a cruise ship, whether from Coronavirus or another cause, the cost of medical care onboard the ship, airlift evacuation, and land based care will be at the expense of the cruise line.3. The cruise line industry provided Government a proposal today. Government will be reviewing the proposal within the next 24 hours and putting plans in place to ensure the safety of the passengers. They will look specifically at the hardest hit states being Florida, Washington, California, and New York.4. The last question of the Q & A session was a 2 part question on coronavirus tests and cruise industry potential bailout. The test question was answered but the bailout question was not.5. They mentioned tax deferrals to assist the hardest hit industries including airlines and cruise lines but the most important focus of the stimulus package is to assist individuals will sick benefits and lost wages.Now it makes sense why RCL and NCLH increased their lines of credit with banks over the past 24 hours.Link to the press conference below (cruise comments start around 4:25 into the video).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k55xdwKJTw",0.9791

Earnings per share were a negative $1.14, compared to $0.48 in the same period last year. The company said that not only were forward bookings for the remainder of 2020 “significantly behind the prior year,” but that even bookings for the first half of 2021 are down. It reported having $4.7 billion in customer deposits as of Feb. 29.It’s worth noting that the period covered by the filing is before the cruise industry suspended all voyages in mid-March. The company still generated $916 million in cash from its operating activities during the first quarter, indicating that its losses in the second quarter — during which no cruises are likely to sail — could be much steeper.",-0.6207

Testing before you embark AND before you can disembark. If one person tests positive forced isolation and the whole ship is quarantined then forced to return to original embarkation port AND then forced quarantine when back on land... only transport from the ship is on non commercial flight or charter buses! The list goes on and on. This is all of course ONLY if each ship passes a simulation cruise and can actually get certified to sail under a huge list of conditions. The cruise lines can't even advertise or sell cruises longer then 7 days anymore! That ends Hawaii, Panama Canal, Transatlantic, South Pacific Crossings, etc. AND before booking a cruise the cruise lines have to advise passengers of the CDC's travel warnings for cruise ships. Good luck getting your travel insurance and even health insurance to cover you. This order is in effect till November 2021. Think about it, one passenger or one crew member tests positive and your socially distanced mask wearing cruise vacation is an instant nightmare!

When cruises continue, CCL will be able to attack the debt right away, prior to reinstating the annual dividend. Not paying out the normal dividend for the next 2-3 years may well be in the cards, but it will allow for CCL to get the debt back to reasonable levels quickly and possibly even buy some stock back, to restore some of the share value lost due to the pandemic.

Obviously, if you can buy in lower and CCL begins to open up cruises that are not sailing, then CCL should rise to the high $30's to low $50's. It is a time sensitive trade and holding maybe my only choice. But I feel strongly that the cruise industry has shown promise once again and will grow.

That way, once cruising does start up, they can maximize the cash they bring in to help pay back all the debt they've taken on to help them through the recession. $LUV $UALhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2021/03/08/why-carnival-corporation-and-norwegian-cruise-line/",0.9927

Net yield growth of MSD+ has been achieved in years of strong demand, and we believe the sensitivity to pricing for cruise equity values is underappreciated.""Price target revisions (2021 year end, taking into account share offerings): Carnival (NYSE:CCL) to $33 (11% upside), Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) to $110 (16% upside) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NYSE:NCLH) to $36 (14% upside).",0.9907

Given they stopped the sales, it must be pretty low compared to the retail value of the boats. 20%, 30%, 40%?? This is unknown, but prospective buyers (of which there are only a few and typically are CCL's competitors) would more than likely be in that 20-40% of retail value range.

411,"Oxford coronavirus vaccine: Does it work? And what happens next?The global race for a vaccine is on - here's what we know about the Oxford vaccine and the effectiveness of other jabs around the world.Scientists believe they have made a significant development with a vaccine that has a ""double defence"" against coronavirusOxford scientists believe they have made a breakthrough in their quest for a Covid-19 vaccine. Here's what you need to know.Does it work?The clinical trials have so far been successful, the Telegraph understands.Researchers have shown that antibodies produced against sections of a genetic material called spike protein, usually found on the surface of the coronavirus, after infection are able to kill the virus when tested in the laboratory. They want the human body to recognise and develop antibodies to the protein that would stop the virus from entering human cells.Trials suggest that not only is this happening but also that the body is developing a crucial T-cell response as well, which is deemed crucial in the defence against coronavirus.When will it be available?AstraZeneca is on track to begin rolling out up to two billion doses of a coronavirus vaccine in September, if ongoing trials continue to prove successful.Chief executive Pascal Soriot revealed last month that they were already starting to manufacture the vaccine.Prof Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford, has said the ""best scenario"" would see results from clinical trials in August and September and deliveries from October.What is the next step?As the level of coronavirus in the UK subsided, scientists began trialling the drug in hospitals, where it was likely to be more prevalent.They have also enrolled 5,000 volunteers in Brazil and others in South Africa.Developers are expected to report their Phase I study results - which would show whether it is safe and whether or not it induces an immune response - within the next fortnight.The global vaccine race: How other countries are developing a jabWorldwide there are some 218 vaccines in development, according to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine's vaccine tracker.Of these, some 29 are in human trials - though experts caution that there is no guarantee any of these will be effective. Or it could be that early versions of immunisations offer only partial protection from disease, reducing Covid-19 from a deadly illness to something comparable to a common cold.The Oxford vaccine is one of the most advanced, described by the World Health Organisation’s chief scientists as a “leading candidate” partly because it has recruited a large number of patients with trials underway in Brazil and South Africa. MeanwhileAmerican biotech, has said the vaccine triggered an antibody and T-cell response in 34 of 36 patients in a recent trial - though they are yet to publish data to back up their press release.Are these other vaccines effective?Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, said that other vaccine technologies are not expected to activate both aspects of our immune system.",0.9991

But the Fed's injection of liquidity to more established banks and bond buyers helped attract better investors and more favorable terms to CCL's bond offering. Now, as we all know, the terms from the April 1st offering were 11.5%, which still isn't great, but the article showed that the Fed's efforts to inject liquidity are working--which wasn't clear until now--and that's a good sign that, if needed, CCL might be able to get more loans with favorable terms from reputable institutions in the future.

They want 'test' cruises to show that mankind is God and king over nature. Its incredibly absurd.It's ridiculous in my opinion for the CDC to think that they are going to eliminate a virus through protocols ...it's overly burdensome and unrealistic. Do they think they are going to control every aspect of our lives regarding someone catching a virus. Uhhh, actually that's exactly what they think.. I've coined it the 'Fauci delusional syndrome.' It's just unnecessary IMO. Especially with a 99.9% survival rate and that the vast majority of people on cruises are between 25 to 70 years old. That group has little to no issues with Covid,.. even if they get it ......Simply have passengers sign a waiver holding the cruise lines harmless if they should contract Covid under the guidance that the cruise lines are making realistic efforts to keep passengers safe and comfortable. Basically an indemnity clause. Which every small business including the cruise lines should employ.To think that man-kind is going to completely control a virus is incomprehensibly pompus.

629,"Listen guys, I don't think many, (if any), cruise ships are gonna have to file for bankruptcy.. I think people will indeed cruise again as early as the no-sail order expirey. I'm basing that off the fact that /i/ personally would sail again as a consumer. Even if the no-sail order gets extended there's still ways around it, like docking outside of the states - however with states already starting to open back up, that's highly unlikely/necessary. It's more likely that the order is suspended early tbh. Especially once the /real/ coronavirus data starts to be released, showing a 0.0x mortality rate. For example here in Ontario it's 0.01.. in Cali I believe 0.03? .. the numbers are just astronomically low. That being said, cruise line passengers and staff /have/ died from the virus.. and even a few deaths can taint the image of that industry and cause psychological issues in future passengers. Majority of people that cruise are old - and old people are at highest risk. They will need to do some serious marketing to target a new demographic, and with that, obviously comes lower revenue than we were seeing pre-corona. Meaning the peak we saw is not the peak we should expect as the evaluation will be decreased for many years. Still, I think a fair value is $38/share by August.

640,"For those of you who say day after day ""Who would ever want to go on a cruise""Pent-up demand': With bookings strong for late 2021, many cruisers are ready to sailMorgan Hines, USA TODAYMon, December 7, 2020, 8:06 AM PSTAfter what will have been a shutdown of more than nine months, the cruise industry is preparing to sail again in the U.S., and major cruise companies have said bookings are strong for the second half of 2021.While the industry prepares to return to U.S. waters with new health and safety precautions and in accordance with new guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the United States, along with much of the globe, finds itself in the midst of a worsening COVID-19 case surge.With the pandemic continuing to rage across the nation, are cruisers raring to get back out there?The answer is yes, according to Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the leading trade organization for the industry. It found that 73% of cruisers say they are ""likely to cruise"" in the next few years, and 50% say they will cruise within the year.The data that Bari Golin-Blaugrund, vice president of strategic communications for CLIA, shared with USA TODAY, was collected before news broke that a vaccine may be available in the coming weeks.""Our data shows that cruisers are eager to cruise again and are willing to follow stringent public health measures in order to return to sailing,"" Golin-Blaugrund said, noting 90% of cruisers polled said they would wear a mask.""People have grown accustomed to taking such precautions on land and understand it is a small sacrifice to make in order to experience the joy of cruising while maintaining a focus on the health and safety of oneself and others,"" she said.Michelle Fee, CEO of travel agency Cruise Planners, echoed the cruise line association's sentiment. She told USA TODAY that there is ""pent-up demand"" for cruising. She expects that many people will be back to sea in the second half of 2021 after rescheduling their 2020 reservations.""There are people who are ready to go and are raising their hands and saying, 'I want to be on one of those initial cruises,' "" Fee told USA TODAY, noting she would be willing to board a ship herself. ""It’s my industry; I would probably be (on) one of them.""""Cruisers are going to cruise,"" she said.Carnival, Norwegian and Royal Caribbean all see demandMultiple major cruise companies said booking trends have proven that cruisers are still interested in sailing in spite of the pandemic – particularly in the second half of 2021.The first half of the year, according to Carnival Corp., reflects COVID-19's affect on the industry, but for the second half of the year, bookings are still looking good.""While the company believes bookings in the first half of 2021 reflect expectations of the phased resumption of its guest cruise operations and anticipated itinerary changes, as of Sept. 20, 2020, cumulative advanced bookings for the second half of 2021 capacity currently available for sale are at the higher end of the historical range,"" Carnival Corp. said in its third-quarter business update.At the company's last business update in October, 60% of those bookings were new as opposed to redeemed future cruise credits being applied to new journeys, Roger Frizzell, spokesman for Carnival Corp., told USA TODAY.Carnival Corp.'s lines are scheduled to resume sailing at various points. Some sailings are canceled into April 2021.Similar to competitor Carnival Corp., Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. said in its third-quarter earnings report released Nov. 9 that bookings are below historic levels, but the company doesn't expect that to continue indefinitely.""There continues to be demand for future cruise vacations, particularly beginning for sailings operating in the second half of 2021 and beyond, despite limited marketing efforts,"" the company said.Norwegian is scheduled to resume sailing in March.And Royal Caribbean echoed the sentiment on bookings.""Booking activity for the first half of 2021 is aligned with the Company's anticipated staggered resumption of cruises,"" the company said in its October earnings report. ""The cumulative booked position for sailings in the second half of 2021 is within historical ranges.""Royal Caribbean Group's cruise lines have suspended sailings through February, with additional cancellations beyond that date.Ken Muskat, executive vice president and COO for MSC Cruises, which has been sailing in the Mediterranean since the summer and expects to sail in U.S. waters in March, said he sees an appetite for travel overall that the company is ready to feed not only in Europe but also in U.S. waters once it receives approval from the CDC.""With our guests eager to get back to cruising and new itineraries, ships and destinations lined up, we’re continuing to see growing interest in our 2021 cruises,"" Muskat told USA TODAY in a statement.150,000 people expressed interest in taking a",0.9992

That's because the chance of getting COVID-19 on cruise ships is high since the virus appears to spread more easily between people in close quarters aboard ships. It is especially important that people with an increased risk of severe illness avoid travel on cruise ships, including river cruises. Cruise passengers are at increased risk of person-to-person spread of infectious diseases, including COVID-19, and outbreaks of COVID-19 have been reported on cruise ships. People who decide to go on a cruise should get tested 1–3 days before their trip and 3–5 days after their trip, even if they are fully vaccinated. In addition to testing, passengers who are unvaccinated should self-quarantine for 7 days after cruise travel, even if they test negative. If they do not get tested, they should self-quarantine for 10 days after cruise travel. Passengers who are fully vaccinated with an FDA-authorized vaccine do not need to self-quarantine after cruise travel.",0.9951

They will talk about imminent bankruptcy, bloodbaths, never again to sail and quite a bit of other negative information. Some will bombard this board with a barrage of postings of cut and paste articles all day long while posting incomplete articles and only post sections that are negative in those articles. In addition, those articles are never dated, and many are old and recycled articles that have been posted on this board on many other occasions. We have CCL bashers; paid posters, totally untruthful people and certain ones who will flip flop their position to make you think they are on your side and then switch positions and then always turn rude when they have taken a short position.You will also find that on days CCL is green they are usually nowhere to be found but on negative days they will come out in packs like circling wolves on a kill with their garbage and taunting posts. The closer CCL gets to being red on the day, the nastier they usually become.Unfortunately, they have driven many real investors away from this board that were helpful and provided real information and knowledge.I urge you to not take their information as fact.

The cruise industry needs the green light from the CDC within the next couple of weeks since it'll take 90 days to prepare to cruise. The CDC has no valid reason to disallow cruising when they are allowing casinos, bars, resorts, airlines, airports, sports venues, restaurants, retail stores, clubs, schools, routine BLM/Antifa protests, and releasing covid positive illegal aliens into the USA! Their stance on cruise lines conflicts with their stance on all other industries! The cruise industry is the only industry not being allowed to operate which is causing thousands of job losses, billions of losses by the cruise lines, and billions of losses in economic activity in the states that have cruise ports! I suspect the current administration and the CDC are being POLITICAL and view cruise lines as POLLUTERS, and they see an excellent opportunity to inflict as much financial damage to their disliked industry as possible, all in the name of public health! They are clearly dragging their feet! I contacted my representatives yesterday, and it only took 5-10 minutes from their website contact portal! It's time to take the gloves off! The cruise lines, as well as the State Attorney Generals from FL, TX, AK, LA, should take immediate legal action against the CDC!",0.9876

The initial cruises will take place with adjusted passenger capacity and enhanced health protocols developed with government and health authorities to follow shoreside mitigation guidelines.Costa Cruises is restarting sailing with two initial ships departing from Italian ports beginning Sept. 6. Costa Deliziosa will offer weekly cruises from Trieste on Sept. 6, 13, 20 and 27, visiting five destinations in southern Italy, including Bari and Brindisi in Puglia, Corigliano-Rossano in Calabria, and Siracusa and Catania in Sicily.

This involved a family of 4 who were quickly identified last week and isolated before being taken off the ship. No other guests were affected. The reality is that there will be cases happening onboard the ships when they sail. As TUI Cruises has shown, with almost 60,000 passengers and only four infections, cruising is an inherently safe activity, provided the necessary measures have been taken and implemented.It shows that the Media is ever so fast to create a frenzy when the ships involved are a sizeable US-based company, Royal Caribbean.

Everyone involved will need to be vaccinated. Onboard crew come from impoverished countries that do not have the vaccine. They will be at the bottom of distribution in industrialized countries. This puts most crew out until late Summer for vaccination. All port personnel and terminal personal will need vaccination. This puts them out until May in most cases.4. Protocols in place for covid free sailing has failed. They will need to announce new testing and protocols to prevent it which they can't do. Their only option is make vaccination a requirement. I think the CDC will mandate that in order to open ports.5. The first sailings that will start in May at the earliest will still be at 33-50% capacity. This will be the case for the first 4-8 weeks. This will also be on about 4 total ships instead of ~12. The others slowly get phased in. 6. The only ports that will be open in 2021 are Port Canaveral and Miami.

But, I'm not going to say 90 percent,"" he told The New York Times.“When polls said only about half of all Americans would take a vaccine, I was saying herd immunity would take 70 to 75 percent,” Dr. Fauci added.“Then, when newer surveys said 60 percent or more would take it, I thought, ‘I can nudge this up a bit,’ so I went to 80, 85.”The needed HIT predictions for coronavirus by Fauci is close to the measles HIT which requires a 90 percent threshold.Once again, the devil is in the detail. No matter how many or how fast companies will produce the vaccine, the reality is that anti-vaxxers will hinder efforts to achieve herd immunity. This will be a very long and painful process. And if you argue that those who refuse the vaccine will not be allowed to cruise, go to a movie theater, take a plane, or dine in restaurants, then you have to consider two things. First, decrease in income for companies who will refuse those who are not vaccinated. And secondly, lawsuits that will pileup against these companies.",0.9562

The last briefing took place on April 27.Thursday’s record came as at least four states — Alabama, Alaska, Montana and Utah — reported their largest daily totals.California, where stay-at-home orders were imposed particularly early in the pandemic, surpassed 200,000 total cases on Thursday, as its number of infections doubled over the past month.

On April 9, 2020, the CDC modified its existing No Sail Order to extend it until theearliest of (a) the expiration of the Secretary of Health and Human Services’ declaration that COVID-19 constitutes a public health emergency, (b)the date the Director of the CDC rescinds or modifies the No Sail Order or (c) 100 days after the order appears on the Federal Register, whichwould be July 24, 2020. Based on the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect that the CDC will extend the No Sail Order beyond ourcurrently announced voyage suspension, which would result in an extension to our suspension of voyages. In addition, the duration of anyvoluntary suspensions the Company has implemented and resumption of operations outside of the United States will be dependent, in part, onvarious travel restrictions and travel bans issued by various countries around the world, as well as the availability of ports around the world.The no cruise will be getting extended, thus the offerings to raise cash that they're bleeding daily.

Yes, another share offering is likely, but not earlier than next year when the stock price will be around 50 and market cap close to 50 billion.

1439,"It is not practical to do cruises until a vaccine is available worldwide for people. Say a 1,000 people board in Miami for a 7 day cruise. Add to this 600 crew. So you have 1,600 people on the cruise ship. Normally you would require the people be self quarantines for 14 days before entering a country. But since they are flying in from all over the place how can you do this? So you just have to hope they are virus free & take their temp ( which is no guarantee of being virus free ) and possible do a Cover-19 test on them before boarding. You may not test positive if you just got the virus in the past day or two. The ship leaves and stops in 5 various island ports over the next week. Everyday they gets off the ship to explore the island and interact with locals and other passengers from other ships. So when they get back on the ship every afternoon their temp is checked and you keep your fingers crossed that they did not catch the virus. If someone tests positive you can rest assured the ship will have to quarantine all passengers for 2 weeks and the ship will not be allowed in any other ports. The cruise line will refund all passengers and give them a free cruise at a later date. Plus the ship will be out of service for a while for massive cleaning. Big financial loss. When the cruise companies can do 6 months of cruises without any cases I will consider cruising again. VACCINE?

I sold for $27, the first loss ever taken in my rollover IRA, seeing nothing positive in the short term. Now in the $11 range, it was a good move to sell. How COVAD-19 plays out is, IMHO, will be the deciding factor of the cruise industry for the next three years or so.

1497,"I'm going to do a quick post to my fellow retail investors, that are not shills for some hedge group or bots, but just average folks trying to set up a potion. What I've noticed for over a month $NCLH, $CCL, and $RCL, really, all Covid-19 impacted stocks, airlines, casinos, etc, but specifically the cruise stocks have been on a down trend. For the last month, especially the last few weeks, they have been trading on very low volume. $NCLH, whcih I have been watching very carefully, has been acting like it has found strong support around 13 a share, and appears to be re-coupled mostly with the market. Why does it matter?I suspect we're seeing a bottom for these stocks, or somewhere near it, and we're going to see a trend change soon, and it will be on full daily volume. Why? I suspect the downward sell pressure in these stocks are weak retail longs selling off, and not institutional investors. Why are they weak and retail? ...because the drop has been painful, but the pain is short term, and it's mostly retail as institutions still hold close to 90% of these stocks. Why short term? Because Covid-19 cannot physically last forever, based on the data. Why do I say that? ...because I've been watching the numbers. The numbers of cases growing, some of the hotspot states, like Florida, California, even Arizona, appear, to be leveling off. I really don't understand why, if it's legitimate or manipulation, and why it isn't being more talked about in the media. Yes, the overall numbers of cases is bad, it's ...really bad. But it's not ""as bad"" as it was a week ago, or two weeks ago, or three weeks ago in some of the states that are supposed to be out of control. As investors, we trend to recognize these trends. If you don't believe me, just google it for yourself. It's like unemployment, it's bad, but, arguably, it's less bad than it was the week prior, and the week before that. When the cases went down before, we saw a HUGE upsurge in these stocks Covid-19 impacted stocks. Then the cases went up and these stocks started to drop...but now, they are going down again. Again, check yourself, let the numbers convince you. This time, we will have both declining cases and vaccines around the corner, no less than five promising candidates in Phase III human trials with results due Oct/Nov. There's also ENORMOUS political pressure to leak positive vaccine results to the markets before the US election, for obvious reasons. I'm not telling you what to do with you money, and I'm not saying this isn't all ""baked"" in. I don't think it is, as new agencies are just now starting to pick it up. You make your own call. I reposition more heavily in some of these Covid-19 stocks myself. I'm only typing this as it's fun to chat about stocks, but also just in case, it gives some investor out there like me another puzzle piece to add to their own strategy. Hope this helps.

As the shutdown continues to be extended with no reliable indication of a end date for cruise lines (previous reopening plans have proven to be unreliable), it will require even more debt to be issued at increasingly unfavorable rates.

That's because the company has a respectable pile of cash on its balance sheet and has drastically reduced its expenses. Carnival raised a combined $6.4 billion in debt and equity financing to help shore up its liquidity. On top of that, the company has announced a combination of layoffs, reduced workweeks, and salary reductions that are expected to save hundreds of millions of dollars annually. According to CEO Arnold Donald, Carnival has enough liquidity to meet all its obligations in a zero-revenue environment for the rest of 2020, which would be a worst-case scenario. Arnold further states that 2021 cruise bookings are strong. And competitor Norwegian Cruise Lines reports that 2021 bookings are within historical ranges despite higher prices. This is important because the cruise industry will probably need to sail at reduced capacity to ensure safety onboard, which could lead to a situation where demand outstrips supply, giving the industry better pricing power.Carnival also plans to stagger fleet reentry to optimize its operations based on demand and doesn't expect any demand issues in the start-up period of operations.",0.9927

As I said in my last post.Shipyard workers preparing new Royal Caribbean ship Odyssey of the Seas test positive for COVID-19Morgan Hines, USA TODAYMon, March 8, 2021, 8:37 AMSix people who have been preparing Royal Caribbean's newest ship, Odyssey of the Seas, for sea trials have tested positive for COVID-19, Jonathon Fishman, spokesperson for Royal Caribbean Group, confirmed to USA TODAY on Monday.The ship is currently under construction in the Meyer Werft Shipyard in Papenburg, Germany. The team working there is preparing the ship for sea trials, according to Fishman. Sea trials are shakedown or test cruises, completed without paying passengers onboard, with the purpose of ensuring that everything is operating properly on a new vessel before it makes its official maiden voyage.""As part of the stringent protocols put in place by the shipyard, all shipyard workers and crew members must receive a negative PCR test result before boarding,"" Fishman said. ""Once on board, the ship conducts daily testing. This process allowed Meyer Werft to detect any possible COVID-19 cases and take the necessary measures to contain the spread of the virus.""Royal Caribbean's Odyssey of the Seas pictured in January 2021 outside of the Meyer Werft shipyard in Germany.Six shipyard workers tested positive and were quarantined on land ""immediately."" As of Monday, there were no positive cases onboard Odyssey of the Seas, Fishman said.Odyssey of the Seas is set to make its debut in May with departures from Israel with all passengers and crew over age 16 vaccinated, the ""first cruise that will offer ""fully vaccinated"" sailings, according to the cruise line.Originally supposed to sail in Rome before heading to Florida in November, the ship's launch in Israel marks the first time the cruise line will have sailings departing from that country, according to Royal Caribbean",0.993

1837,"Should You Buy Carnival Corporation Stock Now?This is a question of time... and money.Rich SmithRich Smith(TMFDitty)Jan 8, 2021 at 8:24AMAuthor Bio2020 was a crazy year for Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL)(NYSE:CUK) beginning with an 80% plunge, and ending up with a loss of ""only"" 57%. But there's a silver lining for investors today: Buy Carnival stock now, and if the share price just goes back to where it was before the coronavirus crisis hit, you've got yourself a clean double.Or so the thinking goes.And that may be thinking right.Cruise ship at seaIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Let's run a thought experiment, shall we? Right now, after its big dip and its partial recovery, Carnival Corporation stock carries a market capitalization of $22.9 billion. Over the five years preceding the pandemic, Carnival averaged profits of about $2.7 billion per year, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. So if you assume that at some point in the future things will get ""back to normal"" for Carnival (and I do), then the stock currently costs a low 8.5 times normalized earnings.That's less than half the 18.7 P/E ratio the stock has averaged over the last decade. And it suggests that there really is a case to be made for Carnival stock doubling once things get back to normal.The bigger question is how long it will take to return to normal, and whether Carnival Corporation has enough cash to survive until cruising resumes and customer interest returns, so that it can get back to making the kind of profit used to make.But there's good news on that front, too. After running the numbers on Carnival, I estimate the company has something on the order of $14.2 billion in cash available to it right now. Even at a monthly cash burn rate of $530 million, this implies that Carnival has sufficient cash to keep itself afloat through about March 2023 without needing to sell any more stock or take out any more loans.Will that be long enough? The best estimates I've seen suggest cruising in the U.S. won't start up again before April or May -- and even those cruises will be of limited duration and with limited passengers on board. We can't expect a full return to normal, I suspect, until vaccines have been widely distributed across the U.S., and experts aren't expecting that to happen before summer. Still, even if cruising isn't back to normal before the end of this year -- or even next year -- it will return to normal eventually, and surely before Carnival runs out of money in early 2023. If you can afford to be patient, I see a real opportunity to earn a double on Carnival stock within the next three years.this was posted 1/08/21 motley Fool Though Im not a big fan of Motley I was exited about the significant cash available to wait...",0.9983

Reading their answers, it's clear that they have no clue when and if we will ever go back to normal life. Put simply, they have no idea if the vaccine will be effective or not, or for how long it will be effective for. They view the vaccine as better that than nothing. According to the CDC, they will begin the process of collecting data after the vaccination campaign reaches the herd immunity target. That means that in 4-5 months from now they will begin collecting data. Obviously, this process will last a few months. So, between the time it will take to vaccinate enough people and the time it will take to collect and analyze the data we are looking at about a year from now before the CDC will even consider to allow sailing.

And who hope that they will have made a profit when/if they finally HAVE to sell it?The reason I ask is that I'm assuming a lot of you bought this stock during this last bull market when the price was between 25 and 55 (roughly). And also assuming you had made some profit on this, or were at least even, at the beginning of the year.So here's my question: once you saw how bad this virus was, and how people were getting stuck on cruise ships getting infected, did it never occur to you how badly this stock was going to get hit? Seriously?Or if you DID foresee this (which took very little thinking to do), did you actually decide to just ride it down and then (hopefully) back up again? Because you hadn't been in the market for 40 years as I have and learned that, in spite of what they've been telling you for the last decade or so, it's NOT always a good idea to 'buy the dips.'Or, I'm assuming there were at least a FEW 'longs' who were pretty darn sure what this pandemic was going to do to the share price of cruise lines, sold early on, and now have the cash to buy four or five times as many shares for the same amount of money when you decide to re-buy CCL?Because as you may, or may not know, if a stock loses 50% of its value, it requires it to go back up 100% to get back to where you started?

Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan introduced the Alaska Tourism Recovery Act on Friday that, if passed, would allow cruise ships to travel between the state of Washington and Alaska without stopping in Canada. Currently, the Passenger Vessel Service Act — passed in 1886 — requires large foreign-flagged ships to stop in Canada before heading north to the state, which wouldn't be possible this year as Canada extended its cruise ship ban through February 2022.""Canada's recent decision to prohibit Alaska-bound cruise ships from operating in Canadian waters creates legal hurdles that will hamstring the Alaska cruise season, creating additional economic strain on Alaska's entire economy, especially in our Southeast communities,"" Murkowski said in a statement. ""Alaskan communities are already facing severe economic hardship and uncertainty from missing one tourism season as a result of COVID-19… Missing another cruise season would only compound the economic fallout that has been devastating for so many families.""Since Canada extended its ban, cruise lines have been forced to cancel Alaska itineraries while some have pivoted to land-based journeys. The introduction of the bill comes weeks after Alaska leaders pledged to find a workaround.Sullivan said Canada's decision has ""dire implications"" for Alaska, adding the state ""simply can't afford to weather another season without the tremendous economic activity that cruise ships provide to our coastal communities.""While Alaska sailings remain in jeopardy, visitors can still head to The Last Frontier to spot wildlife, explore the state's expansive national parks (including the popular Denali National Park), and listen to the deafening crack of calving glaciers.Travelers to Alaska are no longer required to complete a COVID-19 test prior to arrival, but can choose to get tested at the airport.",0.9255

CCL, MGM, BA and a few other are in this group. If you remember back in March 18-19 thru mid April there was a huge surge of buying cheap stocks. Well, it's been one full year and that 15% tax rate looks pretty good about now. The sellers hold a bit for themselves and re- buy more without falling into the ""whitewash"" because the differential was a profit. That's why CCL is fluctuating without a major down turn. And because we all know full sailing is much closer now and $44 CCL is right around the corner. I can even see a price tag of $70 next year. The dividend is two years out possibly three years until the full $0.50 per quarter per share is ok'ed.

I would normally have expected the latest highs in this stock to be dead cat bounces and for us to test the lows again but that hasn’t been the case and it’s been propped up somewhere around the $20 mark. That might - and I say might because there is no real way for me to know - be a signal of movements upwards to come, and not necessarily because of any particular reason, just because there is demand for the stock. It might, on the other hand, be retail investors like yours truly propping this thing up, and if that’s the case then I assume that this part is coming to an end soon - just a matter of when the money dries up.

At worst, he thinks early 2022 will see the full fleet active. A huge uncertainty for cruise lines has been when they'll be able to return to action. The longer the pandemic keeps people off cruises, the more companies need to keep their businesses afloat and the more uncertainty when any payback will come to shareholders. If Donald is seeing a quick recovery by the end of 2021, that's extremely bullish for the industry. It's not clear exactly what a recovery will look like for cruise lines. Vaccines are expected to be widely available in the U.S. by summer, and some companies are considering vaccine passes that would allow for more open movement than current restrictions. That could also be possible on cruise lines, where passenger safety will not only be a priority for operators, it'll be key to getting customers to board ships.",0.9902

This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Those are the official predictions. Absolutely terrible numbers. But the actual result WILL be WORSE, big MISSES on EPS and Revenue estimates. The company is BLEEDING money, 105 ghost cruise ships incurring hundreds of millions of dollars in costs every single day as they sit doing nothing, day after day, for months, with no endgame in sight. The true nightmare comes with looking forward. The company can CHARGE money to book future cruises, but every single PENNY has to be refunded if the ship does not sail. It doesn't matter if the refund is cash, or just a credit for a FUTURE DATE cruise. Doesn't matter because it is still a 100% revenue LOSS for the cancelled cruise. Therefore you CANNOT believe any revenue numbers that are projected going forward, as it is impossible for anyone to know when even a SINGLE ship, much less all 105, will be allowed to sail. So, this next earnings report will deliver absolutely terrible numbers, we KNOW that for SURE. We also know for sure that the NEXT quarter will also deliver terrible numbers, because we already have many days of ZERO sailings that HAVE passed, AND we know there is literally zero chance of any sailings happening before August. We also know for SURE that ANY Guidance that might be provided at this next ER would be absolutely worthless, pure speculation, and a shameless attempt by the company to prop up share price. Because it is IMPOSSIBLE for the company to know when or if they will be able to set sail with any ship, much less all of their ships. We also know, those of us who regularly do Pure Earnings plays, that many stocks will run up in price in the days before an ER, based upon positive speculation and irrational exuberance. But my bet is that we have already seen the run-up on Friday, because of the existing extreme over-valuation that I perceive, based upon the financials I outline above. The current AND future financial outlook going forward. So, I am VERY happy to be Short a lot of shares, and feeling confident this will sell off in a serious way on Monday.

2396,"Heck Yeah, ""BIG GAINS""!Carnival Corp (NYSE:CCL) It’s hard to imagine a worse scenario for the cruise line industry than the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, these stocks were battered and bruised in 2020 while cruise ships stayed docked. However, what’s intriguing about a company like Carnival Corp right now is that there is likely a ton of pent-up demand for cruise vacations. Just look at the fact that Carnival reported advance bookings in Q1 that were up 90% from the prior quarter. The company also saw FY22 bookings running ahead of the strong pre-pandemic levels seen in FY19, confirming that there are still plenty of people ready to hit the open seas.The recent mask update from the CDC is also fantastic news for cruise lines, and investors should view Carnival as a stock with significant upside given that it's still trading well below its pre-pandemic price levels. While this is a company that will report losses this year and still faces a lot of rough waters ahead, there’s a good chance that investors are underestimating just how quickly passenger counts and trips will rise as we continue to receive positive news out of the CDC. Once we have more details about a conditional sailing order and cruises actually start happening again, Carnival stock could be in for big gains.",0.9959

I cannot for a single moment, figure out how life would return back to normal, how airlines can fly people safely at a profit. If they sell less seats, they'll have to jack up the price for overhead, but we WILL be staring at a depressed economy, so how are they going to fill those planes? If people don't fly as much, then how are these customers going to get to the cruise ships? Sailors will have to buy expensive air plane tickets, and possibly more expensive cruise ship tickets as the cruise lines struggle to break even...I also don't get how the SP 500 dips only 15% after the ENTIRE WORLD stops operating for a good chunk of the year. A hold at this position, is saying, ""This company will at the very least operate at a break even, so that the money the borrowed to last until the end of the year, will hold"". I used to spend money, like my money lasted forever, now, I spend money like I'll never be employed again. I cannot imagine this having little to no impact at all. Unemployment numbers are going up, companies are filing for bankruptcy, companies are asking employees to forcing employees to ""volunteer"" quit, so they can still hold onto to that stimulus money. Governors are botching the COVID response. Trump wants to declare another trade war.What I DO get is Warren Buffet selling all his airlines shares, and how he's largely holding cash right now. Mr. Buy when everyone is freaking out, is selling... and hold cash. Mr. Buy and Hold forever... is holding cash.Against all this, somehow, the bulls found the conviction to hold, and amongst all this, they found a reason to buy, that's amazing. Tell you boys what, you flip this around, you can keep my money, consider it kudos money for your tenacity, perseverance, and optimism. You guys are seeing something that I definitely don't.

2430,"Food for thought...Anyone out there who can tell me what our end game is with covid 19?......What is the magic formula that is going to allow us to sound the all clear?..... (My opinion...the election. Trump wins, it goes away to a reasonable approach which includes OPENING the Country. Biden wins, endless lockdowns to destroy small businesses)......Is it zero cases?......The only way that will happen is if we just stop testing and stop reporting. Which in my opinion is what we probably should do. Enough of this testing already...A huge number of people apparently aren't smart enough to understand positive testing doesn't equal to deaths... so the only way to calm the doom and gloom side of America down may be to simply quit testing.... OR get rid of the corrupt main stream media. How many of you got tested for the swine flu?, or get tested for tuberculosis or the common flu on a regular basis?.......So very convenient for a particular political party that Covid just happened to come about the very year of a critical election. Humm........Is a vaccine even going to end covid?....no.............It took 25 years for a chicken pox vaccine to be developed.......The smallpox inoculation was discovered in 1796 the last known natural case was in 1977........We have a flu vaccine that is only 40 to 60% effective and less than half of the US population choose to get one, and roughly 30,000 Americans will die of the flu or flu complications EVERY year.......We already have a growing number of anti vaxxers refusing proven, tested, well known vaccines that have been administered for decades but aren?t necessarily safe!.......Do you really think people will flock to get a fast tracked, quickly tested vaccine, whose long term side effects and overall efficacy are anyone's best guess? ......How long are we going to cancel and postpone and reconsider?......You aren't doing in person school until second quarter?...third quarter? EVER?? And this is with a virus that has basically zero effect on people under 25!!.......When do we decide quality of life outweighs the less than 1% risks?.......We all understand that Covid can be deadly or dangerous for SOME people...VERY FEW PEOPLE actually...but so are strawberries and shellfish.......We take risks multiple times a day without a second thought.......When and how did we so quickly lose our free will and give up our liberty? I'll tell you how ...election season... and fraudulent fear mongering left-wing media and allowing corrupt governors and mayors to take over your lives for power grabbing,..that's how..........I understand that there is a minuscule possibility I could die, actually its far less than 1%, and that's IF I actually contract the virus......but if i do, I will most likely just end up feeling like #$%$ for a few days........I also understand I could possibly pass it to someone else, but I can pass on any virus onto someone else, like the flu or other issues like tuberculosis or any number of other complications we humans face on a regular basis........Where or how does this end?......We either get busy living or we stay occupied with worrying about dying. You have a better chance of getting hit by lightning if you're under 65 than dying by covid. Do all of you stay indoors in fear of being hit by lightning??.....When God above decides it's your time brother, you don't get any mulligans, so I would rather spend my time enjoying life with my family than worrying about a virus with a 99.9% survival rate....Just saying....",0.9979

In order to support a 600 million dollar a month burn rate they will have to issue an additional 350 million new shares at $24 at share. Look for this to happen soon.

2518,"Betting against recovery, and every major pharmaceutical company and government in the world working to create a vaccine is foolish. The reality is that a vaccine is within weeks if not days from being fielded, and Carnival is and remains stronger than it's peers in the industry. As Thomas Yeung wrote in his article ""Carnival Stock Is a 200% Return Opportunity"" he points out ""Carnival Cruise lines is trading at just 0.6 times book value (compared to its long-term average of 1.9 times), and that even growth investors would be foolish to ignore this opportunity."" About CCL's worth and debt: Of the three major cruise lines, Carnival holds the least debt. Even now, its 1.1 times debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is far lower than RCL’s 2.2 and Norwegian’s 2.4. (It’s also true when you include second lien debt) Carnival is also the most consistently profitable. It earned the highest return on assets (ROA) in 2019 coming at 6.8%. Today, Carnival trades for the cheapest on tangible book coming in at 0.6x, and 7.5x on the price to cyclically adjusted PE (CAPE) ratios. About CCL's value: Using consensus estimates of a 2023 return to normalcy and factoring the company’s B1 bond rating (implying a 24.8% chance of bankruptcy), a two-stage DCF model shows a fair value of $46, almost a 200% upside. That would mean a 16.5 times CAPE ratio.Yeong ends his article with a bubble busting reality-check pointing out that in the short term ""It’s going to be a slow recovery for Carnival: generating $2 billion of free cash flow still means taking 4-5 years to fix its balance sheet. But for those foreseeing a quick coronavirus recovery, it’s essential to pull the trigger now.""as bargain pricing like this will not be around for long. I agree with Yeong's $46. TP by 2023. My position is bullish with a TP of $26 by Q2-2021 once cruising begins, and a vaccine is fielded around the world.",0.9936

It's unclear what happened, it may not even have been the vaccine, they will pause until they can investigate, these pauses are a normal part of the process. This is not impacting the timeline of a vaccine, as the two front runners, Moderna and Pfizer, use a different technology and delivery system, and both are up pre-market. AstraZennaca is down less pre-market than some cruise companies$RCL $CCL $NCLH, if that gives an idea at the level of worry. Feel free to invest as you will, of course, but I suspect any momentary dips in cruise will be short lived.

The 15 minute Covid-19 test likely to help restart cruise, and the real game changer, is totally unaffected.

Played golf the other day with a buddy who had Covid.. said it was like having the flu but he’s back to hitting 330 yard drives, he’s fully recovered. Sound like the end of the world? Right, because its not. Highly likely half the country has had Covid but didn’t know. In the end, it doesn’t matter with Chuck or anyone else has to say about cruising or what it will be like. If people are healthy, going on a cruise is just as risky as any other time (see above example of healthy individual hitting bombs again). I’m 44 and healthy. My chance of death is 4 in 1,000.

Yes they also have more Cash on hand to pay the debts, but the conditions of the loans are terrible. Secondly the outstanding shares have also increased when the company issues new stock at $8.00. More shares outstanding means less value per share. Even if CCL returns to normal sailing conditions (we still don't know when that will be) the years it might take to return to normal profitably is to uncertain in my opinion to call this a stable investment.

I have made some money and cash out and did the whole AAPL & TSLA thing and cashed out earlier in the week with large profits. Now, I'm gong to take some serious money (for me) and buy around 6,000 shares of CCL. i still have around 3000 left over from previous purchase. I have researched for months and months looking through time lines and charts until i blue in the face. However, now is the time if there ever was a time for this stock IMO. I'm looking for short term 6 weeks. what I think or hope is going to happen. First, rapid testing. Second, no more delays for cruising. Thus, i'm looking for this stock to hit its last high resistance of $26ish area which was in June within that time frame (however, Id be happy at low 20's as well). My problem is that I make profit and then sell out of a gain. I have a problem with keeping it in there and riding it to new highs. Thus, I day trade this stock and make ok money but not letting it ride money. I need to stick with my original plan and if I've done that already id be quite richer already with CCL.

Look at how much their margins will drop due to lower occupancies on each cruise. Look at the risk of exposure lawsuits.

This was supposed to be one of the test cruises for Royal Caribbean which has a 50:50 joint venture with TUI of Germany which manages the Mein Schiff ships.Mein Schiff claimed that it cancelled the cruise because it was unable to fill a re-start team in time for the cruise.

Stock to go down another 5% on those?- The ""Healthy Sail"" panel consists of 6 doctors and only 3 cruise ship executives. Yikes. Given that basic fact I don't think they will vote in favor reopening cruises soon. In particular, the ongoing 40k new cases per day in the US is a problem and those doctors will naturally need to be conservative. They must protect their jobs/careers. Giving a ""yes"" vote, and possibly being wrong by Dec/Jan, could be a career ending mistake. - After the Nov election, if Democrats win, those same 6 doctors (and the CDC mind you) will still vote ""no"" to protect their positions/careers until the new administration comes. In essence, CCL shareholders need a Trump win to get these cruise ships going again. - The real kicker: There is always crowding on elevators in cruise ships, and certainly crowds at the elevator lobby areas if they only allow 1-2 elevator passengers at a time, so it can't work. It's a physically impossible distancing problem there. They simply can't get the necessary protocol of social distancing there. - Once all the other protocols are in place the cruises won't even be desired (no shows to avoid crowds, no bar crowds, no gambling crowds, no packed pool areas, only very limited people in restaurants, etc.) The whole point of a cruise, or at least most of it, is the social activity ....so it simply doesn't work.",0.9959

Such measures include limited capacity, swab tests for all guests and crew, temperature checks when disembarking and re-embarking the ship, protected shore excursions, physical distancing on board and at the cruise terminals, new ways of using on-board services, enhanced sanitation and medical services, and use of protective face masks when necessary.Details of the itineraries, with related booking options, will soon be available on the website www.costacruises.eu and at travel agencies.",0.9954

3089,"@Koch Brother they would have to increase sales and profit massively to get to $90, are they going to double their fleet? Also wait for the recession this year or next and then sideways economy or slightly down for a decade. Cruises have invested massively, they will have all these empty rooms and be fighting to pay you to a take one. I was on celebrity summit last year, not exactly new, the traditional dining was the best of the ""worst"" so to speak, vs the buffet, crowded with larger people stuffing their faces with fried chicken and potatoes. While most of the fine dining dishes were trying to be something they clearly were not, it was good and at times very good but certainly not memorable. the service in the restaurant was excellent and the wine steward outstanding lady from Ukraine. If you know about food and restaurants, you can see where they are cutting corners. It is institutuinal catering after all. The beef was the most disappointing. From youtube it looks like the steakhouses on the american lines like carnival and RC are better, but the speciality restos are way overpriced for the little difference in food quality with the main restaurant. In fact, the food is almost the same or exactly the same, not surprisingly. Some of the pluses were the outdoor spa restaurant with helathier options, the 24h excellent pizza, the eggs benedict station with hollandaise on tap and small grill stations behind the buffet. And the maginificent outdoor bar deck at the rear with 270 degree ocean views for meals outside overlooking the water 7 stories up was the highlight. Fortunately, the buffet folks never discovered this hidden gem at the back of the ship and they ate in the glass enclosed cafeteria areas. Anyways, overcapacity, slowing demand and food costs are always risks for these companies. And they can't keep cutting on quality and start charging extras for everything. So it's a catch 22. Airlines are usually bad investments over time, cruise ship market is still rising but as capacity gets fully built out, it will become a fine game of cost control and profit maximisation for any of them to make money next 5 years",0.9967

The current, and uncertain future, impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, including its effect on the ability or desire of people to travel (including on cruises), is expected to continue to impact our results, operations, outlooks, plans, goals, reputation, litigation, cash flows, liquidity, and stock price; • As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, we may be out of compliance with a maintenance covenant in certain of our debt facilities, for which we have waivers for the period through November 30, 2021 with the next testing date of February 28, 2022; • World events impacting the ability or desire of people to travel may lead to a decline in demand for cruises; • Incidents concerning our ships, guests or the cruise vacation industry as well as adverse weather conditions and other natural disasters may impact the satisfaction of our guests and crew and lead to reputational damage; • Changes in and non-compliance with laws and regulations under which we operate, such as those relating to health, environment, safety and security, data privacy and protection, anti-corruption, economic sanctions, trade protection and tax may lead to litigation, enforcement actions, fines, penalties and reputational damage; • Breaches in data security and lapses in data privacy as well as disruptions and other damages to our principal offices, information technology operations and system networks, including the recent ransomware incident, and failure to keep pace with developments in technology may adversely impact our business operations, the satisfaction of our guests and crew and lead to reputational damage; • Ability to recruit, develop and retain qualified shipboard personnel who live away from home for extended periods of time may adversely impact our business operations, guest services and satisfaction; • Increases in fuel prices, changes in the types of fuel consumed and availability of fuel supply may adversely impact our scheduled itineraries and costs; • Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial results; • Overcapacity and competition in the cruise and land-based vacation industry may lead to a decline in our cruise sales, pricing and destination options; • Geographic regions in which we try to expand our business may be slow to develop or ultimately not develop how we expect; and • Inability to implement our shipbuilding programs and ship repairs, maintenance and refurbishments may adversely impact our business operations and the satisfaction of our guests.”",0.9509

3198,"We were scheduled to depart on the Grand Princess on March 7th and this wasn’t our first cruise but it was with Princess.Here is my take on CCL:1. CCL and Princess showed tremendous level of greed by putting their crew, passengers, and public at risk.2. We have traveled with Carnival ships previously and was our first one with Princess and had 3 celebrations planned on this cruise. Princess is considered more premium so you pay more but it’s freighting to see that Princess has more issues than even smaller cruise lines or considered cheaper. This tells me Princess has management problems as it seems there is sheer incompetence and greed in the top + mid management there and they all need to go! You can’t possibly tell me that you couldn’t afford to give a shit about health and well being because you don’t make enough? Give me a break! That too after the nightmare they created and single handedly spread COVID-19 to so many people???? After that fiasco the incompetent management didn’t think they should pay attention a little more closely at CCL level? Shows poor corporate governance and culture of patting each other on the back and laughing all the way to the bank. No different than Boeing, Wells Fargo, Enron, and others! At the end of the day, companies are made of people as are cultures so there are some serious issues at CCL that needs to be overhauled.3. We called Princess a few days before our scheduled trip, asking to defer and they very strongly kept denying it. They could have easily shown flexibility and allowed passengers to defer their plans but no, the corporate greed wouldn’t let them which is so deeply rooted in their processes. The lower level employers are told to “tow the line” or be discarded and while the employees themselves felt bad, they couldn’t do it.Mind you, we would have been happy with Princess if they had just allowed us to defer and not even seek refund, giving is a positive experience that would have given them so much good will but no, corporate greed rained supreme. Low and behold, now not only did they have to cancel the voyage but also refund us fully and issue another full credit to convince us to sail with them again. THAT corporate greed cost them more than if they would have done the right thing to begin with and would have gained a customer for life, willing to support them and give them a 2nd chance.But, not at this point. I seriously hope they go bankrupt at this point as we could care less about their credit because no amount of money in this world can make up for their jeopardizing the health of our family, the general public, and their crew that work so hard.These people are amazing and every ship we have been ever on, it’s the crew that make the experience of the guests, not management and for them to put their lives at stake knowingly so that they can save a few bucks to stiff their pockets, is disgusting!I hope CCL stock dives, tanks, and crashes and burns as such incompetence and greed can not be rewarded!",0.9964

We are talking about what we are doing with our terminals and understanding what the obligations and criteria will be moving forward,” said Jonathan Daniels, who took over as the new CEO and port director at Port Everglades over the summer.The 2020-2021 season for Port Everglades was poised to be a good one – the new Enchanted Princess was slated to call the port home, along with the Celebrity Apex and Odyssey of the Seas.Looking at the new Celebrity Apex outside his office window, Daniels said he was working closely with the Royal Caribbean Group to understand what the terminal experience will look like.“The difficult part will ultimately be determining where the line of demarcation is for accountability and responsibility,” Daniels said.Guests will have staggered check in times, basically appointments to board, and the terminals will need to be re-flowed a bit, meaning various zones for testing, isolation and more.“Laboratories, testing, how does that translate into space in the terminal?” Daniels asked. “What happens if there is a positive case?”Asking those questions is part of an unknown, without answers or guidance yet from the CDC.Head StartThe port’s ferry service to the Bahamas launched for a two-week period in July, as it was not affected by the CDC’s “No Sail” order with a ship under 250 passengers aboard.That meant Port Everglades had a trial run of sorts, installing plexiglass barriers, signage and hand sanitizer distribution stations in a terminal.“We’ve been moving beyond that and integrating that into other terminals in anticipation of a restart of cruising,” Daniels said.50,000Pre COVID, a weekend in the winter could see upwards of 50,000 people move through Port Everglades on a single day with ships at all the port’s cruise berths.With the business mounting a comeback in 2021, Daniels said potential for growth beyond that would be in increasing the utilization of cruise terminals, especially for itineraries leaving mid-week, along with building up more summer business.With a pivot toward closer-to-home and shorter cruises, the port is well positioned in Florida to take advantage of that.",0.9984

If they expect the share price to keep going up & up, as many shareholders are hoping, then why couldn’t they wait till later on this year, when the 1 Billion dollar shares sales would cause less dilution by selling less shares for the same amount of money??To me, this implies that they need more cash than they initially stated & that they do not expect the share price to keep going up.",0.9862

I do think the COVID cases will ultimately suppress demand, which they'd try to offset with price drops, this could mean that overall, on a per month basis, they'll be operating at a loss.https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-travel-industry-will-bounce-back-norwegian-cruise-line-says-but-for-now-its-burning-cash-51588086284",0.6438

Before the crisis they had profits, yearly profits of 2.1 billion dollars. Even with those profits they had 10 billion in debt. Even if they went back to the margins and the bottom line that they had before the pandemic they're looking at 12 years just to pay off the debt.

Moderna said its vaccine is currently not approved for use in the Philippines, so will work with regulators to pursue approvals before the doses are distributed.""Please notice that Moderna's vaccine is not currently approved in the Philippines, and vaccines will likely start in mid-2021 (June). The population of the Philippines is about 110 million. So, possibly the Philippines can have about 20% of the population vaccinated with Moderna's vaccine by August or September.

At worst, he thinks early 2022 will see the full fleet active. A huge uncertainty for cruise lines has been when they'll be able to return to action. The longer the pandemic keeps people off cruises, the more companies need to keep their businesses afloat and the more uncertainty when any payback will come to shareholders. If Donald is seeing a quick recovery by the end of 2021, that's extremely bullish for the industry. It's not clear exactly what a recovery will look like for cruise lines. Vaccines are expected to be widely available in the U.S. by summer, and some companies are considering vaccine passes that would allow for more open movement than current restrictions. That could also be possible on cruise lines, where passenger safety will not only be a priority for operators, it'll be key to getting customers to board ships.",0.9891

3625,"CDC Lifts COVID-19 Testing Requirement for Vaccinated Cruise PassengersAlison FoxTue, May 18, 2021, 10:40 AM PDTCarnival Cruise shipCarnival Cruise shipBrittany Murray/MediaNews Group/Long Beach Press-Telegram via Getty ImagesCruise lines are not required to test fully vaccinated passengers before embarking on a trip or upon returning to port, according to updated guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The new guidance, the latest easing of coronavirus-era protocols for vaccinated travelers, applies to simulated and restricted sailings under the agency's Framework for Conditional Sailing Order. Travelers who got the jab as well as those who contracted COVID-19 within the past 90 days and recovered also don't need to get tested onboard if they come into contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 as long as they are asymptomatic.Conversely, travelers who are not vaccinated have to get tested before boarding a ship on the day of embarkation, on the day they disembark, and between all back-to-back sailings. If they come into contact with a confirmed case of the virus, they also need to get tested and potentially quarantine for 14 days.All passengers must get tested if they show signs or symptoms of COVID-19.When it comes to testing, both PCR and rapid antigen tests are allowed, but PCR tests are preferred on cruise ships, according to the agency.The new rules come just days after the CDC said vaccinated cruise passengers can go maskless in certain outdoor settings and explore ports on their own without having to book an excursion through the cruise line. It's also in line with the agency's recommendation that fully vaccinated people can safely go without masks in outdoor situations and many indoor situations.The CDC has recommended both passengers and crew get vaccinated before sailing and has waived the need for test sailings for ships with all vaccinated people. Last month, the agency said fully vaccinated people could travel freely with low risk to themselves.Several cruise lines have implemented vaccination policies for their guests and require tests before boarding or before disembarking.Cruising in the United States remains on pause, but the CDC has said test sailings can begin soon with the goal of resuming in mid-summer.Alison Fox is a contributing writer for Travel Leisure.

3629,"The scariest prospect here, in terms of valuation, is how long it will take for any of the cruise lines to return to their former glory. Analysts see Carnival earning $2.25 a share come 2024. One way to look at this is that the stock is currently trading for 10 times what it will earn four years from now, but the more sober approach is that even in 2024, it will be barely half as profitable on a per-share basis as it was in 2019. A big reason for the drop in bottom-line forecasts is that the players have taken on a lot of water this year in the form of new shares and fresh debt. Carnival's full-diluted share count has gone from 688 million to 775 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2020. More shares mean lower earnings on a per-share basis. Long-term debt in the same nine months has gone from $9.7 billion to $18.9 billion, and those interest payments will eat into earnings, period. As a riskier investment, it's also having to pay more for borrowed money. Its interest expense for its latest quarter is a sixfold increase from where it was nine months earlier.",0.9788

Ok based on my math to raise 2 billion in common equity at $14.50 a share would mean 137 MILLION in new shares diluting current shareholders.... then the 1.5 billion in convertibles mean they can convert to common at a certain price/ time frame so could easily add another 100 million shares to dilute current shareholders!Anyone long needs to think about how the stock price will react to that level of dilution!!,0.9832

Mexican officials said on Saturday, March 13, 2021, that ferries and cruise ships may soon be visiting the former prison, after the last island penal colony in the Americas was closed and turned into an environmental education center in 2019. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell, File)MoreSun, March 14, 2021, 9:40 AMMEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican officials said ferries and cruise ships may soon be visiting the former Isla Marias prison, after the last island penal colony in the Americas was closed and turned into an environmental education center in 2019.The education camp hasn’t gone very well — only 40 youths have been trained on the island — and the administration of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is now trying a different tack, because the island hasn't been offsetting the costs associated with keeping it open.Officials said Saturday they are planning to build a dock for larger ships on the Isla Madre main island, the only one of the four Marias islands that is inhabited. Visitors will be able to tour the remote island jail, but not stay overnight. Tourism Secretary Miguel Torruco described future tours.“The experience begins with the cruise ship or ferry arriving from Mazatalán or San Blas, to Isla Madre, and on the voyage the passengers can admire the beauty of the ocean,"" Torruco said. It would be quite a long ride; the four islands are located 70 miles (110 kilometers) off the Pacific coast of Nayarit state.- ADVERTISEMENT -“Visitors will have their first contact with the former island prison which for 100 years sheltered numerous criminals,” Torruco said. Officials compared it to the now-closed U.S. prison at Alcatraz, and said tourist visits could start within three months.The penal colony, founded in 1905, passed through some periods of infamous brutality, and as recently as 2013, the Islas Marias held 8,000 inmates.The hemisphere was once dotted with remote island jails like the one depicted in the movie “Papillon,” but they all gradually closed. When Panama closed its Isla Coiba penal colony in 2004, Isla Marias became the last one remaining in the Americas.But far from the bloody reputation of places like Devil’s Island — the French Guiana penal colony shuttered in 1946 — toward the end, the Islas Marias harbored many lower-risk or well-behaved inmates and the colony was viewed as a step toward release or rehabilitation.While the prison kept mass tourism at bay, the islands suffered severe environmental degradation from over a century of use as a penal colony.Island penal colonies were used around the world starting in the 1700s as remote, escape-proof places to “rehabilitate” inmates through hard labor. Often known as “prisons without bars,” with the ocean serving as the most effective barrier to escape, the penal colonies were also known for being at least in part self-supporting and a way to settle remote islands.But in the end, the Islas Marias wound up costing Mexico far more per prisoner than did mainland jails.Chile closed its Santa Maria prison island in the late 1980s, Costa Rica’s Isla San Lucas penal colony closed in 1991 and Brazil’s Isla Grande in 1994. Peru dramatically ended its El Fronton island prison in 1986: Gunboats blew up most of the buildings to put down a riot, killing more than 100 inmates.",-0.9947

Superficially it is due to the strong dollar and high fuel costs but these were already in the main stream for the average investors. Other factors to consider are that the dividend yield at 2.8% is not exceptional and can quickly go down in a'Cyclical Consumer' stock especially when it is covered twice by expected earnings.

During the crash of 1987 (also known as ""Black Monday""), the Dow dropped 22% in one day in the U.S.In the 1973–74 bear market, the market lost 45% in about 22 months. The attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, also resulted in a sizable market drop. The list goes on and on, but those are times when contrarians found their best investments.After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the world stopped flying for a while. Suppose that at this time, you had made an investment in Boeing (BA), one of the world's largest builders of commercial aircraft. Boeing's stock didn't bottom until about a year after Sept. 11, but from there, it rose more than four times in value over the next five years. Clearly, although Sept. 11th soured market sentiment about the airline industry for quite some time, those who did their research and were willing to bet that Boeing would survive were well rewarded.",0.972

3787,"https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/16/will-the-coronavirus-bankrupt-carnival-corp.aspx2020 has been a rough year for CarnivalCarnival has been especially hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic, particularly its Princess Cruises line. The nightmare started with the Diamond Princess, which saw over 700 of its passengers and crew contracting COVID-19 during a tour of East Asia. Later, the Grand Princess, Coral Princess, and Ruby Princess all had major outbreaks onboard.On March 12, Princess President Jan Swartz announced a pause of ship operations on the Princess line. This move, along with overall market weakness due to government-mandated travel restrictions, has led Carnival to impair the carrying value of ships in both its NAA segment (which represents North American and Australia) and its EA segment (which represents Europe and Asia). In total, the company recorded $731 million in goodwill impairment charges for these reporting units in the first quarter.Carnival's fiscal-first-quarter revenue (which represents the three months ended Feb. 29) did not show notable coronavirus impact. Revenue was up around 2.5% from $4.67 billion to $4.79 billion year-over-year. But the goodwill impairment charge was a major factor in Carnival's bottom line deteriorating from a profit of $336 million to a loss of $781 million.Management taps debt and equity marketsThe cruise industry is notably excluded from the White House's $2 trillion economic stimulus plan, and it will not be receiving a bailout. This means Carnival has had to tap the debt and equity markets.Carnival has undertaken a public offering of 62.5 million common shares for $8 each, along with what's known as a greenshoe option that allows the underwriters of the deal to purchase an additional 9.375 million shares if they want. The dilutive capital raise is joined by a debt raise of $4 billion worth of 11.5% senior secured notes and $1.75 billion in 5.75% senior convertible notes -- both due in 2023.When all is said and done, Carnival will have around $7.6 billion in cash on its balance sheet (adding the $500 million from stock sales and the $5.75 billion in debt raised to the $1.35 billion in cash the company reported in the first quarter). The new capital should help Carnival through a near-term slowdown, but it won't be smooth sailing because of the company's significant cash outflows. Can Carnival fight off bankruptcy?Carnival burned through around $12.9 billion in operating costs and expenses in fiscal 2019. The company will quickly run out of money if it faces similar cash outflows in 2020.The good news is that at least $5 billion of these outflows (food, fuel, tours, and onboard) seem to be variable, while $5.17 billion (payroll and ship operating costs) seem to be fixed. That means Carnival will have to pay these outflows whether or not it runs cruises. Carnival's $2.72 billion in commissions, transportation, and other outflows seem to fall somewhere in between variable and fixed cash outflows.With around $7.6 billion in cash on its balance sheet, Carnival should be able to sustain an estimated $5.17 billion in cash outflows for payroll and ship operating costs. And it should also be able to pay the $1.8 billion in debt maturing in 2020. The only other major challenge will come from new ship deliveries. As of the most recent annual report, the company has up to 17 additional ships scheduled to be delivered by 2025, with six new ships entering service in 2020.",0.9271

So make sure to keep an eye on this stock going forward, to see if this recent move higher can last.Carnival currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while its Earnings ESP is negative.Still on the sidelines.

4294,"Ouch. Good chance the ""no-sail"" order is put back in place (per USA Today posted Friday):Members of Congress are calling for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to reinstate its ""no-sail"" order, which expired at the end of October and was replaced by a ""Conditional Sailing Order"" that allows a phased-in return to cruising.""The CDC is putting American lives at risk, not to mention the potential for enhancing the spread worldwide,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, told USA TODAY Friday.Blumenthal and Rep. Doris Matsui, a Democrat from California, who are co-sponsors of the proposed Cruise Passenger Protection Act, made the request for reinstatement in a letter to CDC Director Robert Redfield.The letter came after a cluster of COVID-19 cases emerged on SeaDream Yacht Club's SeaDream I, which is currently docked in Barbados after having to cut its first Caribbean voyage short due to the outbreak. “These multiple cases are only the first sign of a looming public health disaster,"" Blumenthal said.“In light of these disturbing reports, we feel strongly that you should reverse course on the recent decision by the (CDC) to take a phased approach to restarting cruise line operations in the United States,” Blumenthal and Matsui wrote. “Instead, we implore you to extend the prior no-sail order until a time when the health and safety of passengers and crew can be assured.”They pointed out in the letter that in spite of the cruise line's efforts to sail safely, including aggressive testing, social distancing, mask wearing requirements and more, the precautions weren't enough to stop the coronavirus from infecting at least seven passengers on board the SeaDream.""According to the CDC’s own no-sail order, '[c]ruise ships continue to be an unsafe environment with close quarters where the disease spreads easily and is not readily detected,'"" the letter continues. ""In fact, cruise ships were breeding grounds for the virus at the epicenter of the initial COVID-19 outbreak. With the images of passengers and crew stranded aboard the Grand Princess still fresh in our minds, it is imperative that we learn from the past and take immediate action to prevent history from repeating itself.""The Grand Princess was one of two Princess Cruises ships that experienced an early outbreak of COVID-19, forcing passengers to quarantine during the pandemic's onset in the beginning of March.The letter Blumenthal and Matsui sent to the CDC Friday isn't the only one the agency has received from Congress.In September, before extending its order until Oct. 31, the CDC requested that the ""no-sail"" order be extended to Feb. 15, 2021, but compromised with the White House Task Force to extend it only until Oct. 31, four days before the Nov. 3 election, a person familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly told USA TODAY at the time.As a result, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat from New York who chairs the House subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, has made an official request for records from the CDC. The request came amid circulating allegations that President Donald Trump's administration intervened when the CDC proposed that its ""no-sail"" order, banning cruise ships carrying more than 250 passengers from sailing in U.S. waters be extended into February amid coronavirus pandemic uncertainty.Blumenthal and Matsui acknowledged that the ""Conditional Sailing Order"" listed out a ""seemingly robust and phased approach to restarting cruise line operations"" but said they have concerns that cruising is ""simply unsafe during a global pandemic,"" especially as cases continue to rise across the country, which had seen more than 10.6 million cases and nearly 243,000 deaths by Friday afternoon according to Johns Hopkins data.The conditional order ""lacks efficient specificity and rigor,"" Blumenthal said, noting that in order for cruising to restart, he believes there needs to be ""a much reduced incidence of the disease,"" ""very stiff guidelines and restrictions on the number of people on board"" and ""routine testing."" But most of all, he said, the pandemic ""as we know it now"" must end before cruise ships can safely sail.The cruise industry made the call earlier this month to extend its own voluntary pause on operations until 2021. By pushing sailing off until the new year, they will have more time to prepare and align industry protocols with standards in the CDC's new order, which includes test sailings, among other requirements to be completed, before passenger cruises can resume.In the letter, Blumenthal and Matsui requested a response from Redfield no later than Nov. 27.""We’ll see massive outbreaks on cruise ships, which will become floating hot spots with major casualties.",0.999

Of course this will hurt the share price as more common stock is poured into the market. It's not a good feeling knowing that it went up near $17 to drop back down to $15.31. I do like that they are working towards a nominal cash burn rate and they have started cruising in Europe further lowering the cash burn. I know CDC and Trump administration is probably at odds with each other about the coronavirus guidelines and everybody does not know how to go about deregulating the restrictions. CDC wants to probably maintain strict guidelines while the Trump administration wants them to lift them. CDC doesn't want to take responsibility if there are any deaths associated with lifting the restriction and Trump would be more keen to lifting the restrictions because he doesn't mind getting attacked by the media. CDC would probably be willing to lift the order if the Trump administration took full responsibility for lifting the restriction but also they probably feel it would be irresponsible just to take their hands off when it could lead to death. I personally don't think the CDC gives a hoot but they have to ""care"" or they will get crucified. Government workers are lazy I know because I work with them on a daily basis. I have seen the worldometer data and I truly believe the virus poses no threat. This is why I invest in Carnival. However, depending on who you talk to they will have different opinions. The difficult part is having people feel comfortable with the virus. Especially with all the fear mongering going on in the media and when you deal with death it gets extremely sensitive. Even when it impacts just a small portion of our population because everyone knows someone who is elderly and has a comorbidity. CDC also reported only 6% of people actually only died from just the coronavirus while 94% infected with covid had comorbidities and died. I am wondering of those 94% with comorbidities if they had other symptoms that could have elevated their co-morbidities like stress, depression, flu, etc. Anyways cost cruises returned to Genoa today and that is welcome news for Carnival. Any sailing news is welcome news as it will help keep lowering to a nominal cash burn rate.

4391,"From InvestorPlace 2 days ago...........I think this just about sums it up.....""The easiest way to see this at Carnival is to look at the company’s bond offerings. Regardless of what the stock market is doing from day-to-day, a company’s credit tends to be more steady. Generally, you have institutions as the primary buyers for corporate debt, and they are pickier in terms of the things they are willing to back.Carnival’s improving financial outlook can be seen by comparing its various bond offerings. Back in April, Carnival had to pay an exorbitant 12% interest rate on its new bond issuance to get access to much-needed cash. In July, Carnival raised another big chunk of money at a slightly less punitive 11% interest rate.This past week, Carnival announced another bond offering, which seeks to bring in roughly $2 billion. Analysts see the deal getting done at an 8% interest rate. That’s way better than the levels Carnival raised its debt at earlier this year, and it also beats the 9% range that folks had expected from this latest offering. With demand for this latest offering come in strong, however, Carnival will be able to issue more bonds than initially expected and at better interest rates as well. That’s good news all around.Carnival Stock VerdictThis speaks to the broader point: Carnival is no longer at high risk of failure. Now investors are just assessing how long it will take for things to start getting back to normal. The latest spike in virus cases and subsequent CDC warning are a short-term negative. However, the worst-case scenarios are off the table thanks to the company’s successful fundraising efforts.Importantly, Carnival has been much more successful in its efforts than some of the other listed cruise lines. As a result, Carnival should be able to do alright even if cruises are prohibited again in the short-term.""",0.9935

4398,"Passengers on Cruise ShipsU.S. citizens, particularly travelers with underlying health conditions, should not travel by cruise ship. CDC notes increased risk of infection of COVID-19 in a cruise ship environment. In order to curb the spread of COVID-19, many countries have implemented strict screening procedures that have denied port entry rights to ships and prevented passengers from disembarking. In some cases, local authorities have permitted disembarkation but subjected passengers to local quarantine procedures. While the U.S. government has evacuated some cruise ship passengers in recent weeks, repatriation flights should not be relied upon as an option for U.S. citizens under the potential risk of quarantine by local authorities. This is a fluid situation. CDC notes that older adults and travelers with underlying health issues should avoid situations that put them at increased risk for more severe disease. This entails avoiding crowded places, avoiding non-essential travel such as long plane trips, and especially avoiding embarking on cruise ships. Passengers with plans to travel by cruise ship should contact their cruise line companies directly for further information and continue to monitor the Travel.state.gov website and see the latest information from the CDC: https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/cruise/index.html.",0.9866

However, she is the Canadian expert and resident know it all.Congress urges Canada to reevaluate banning cruises until 2022Morgan Hines, USA TODAYSun, February 28, 2021, 8:36 AMA U.S. congressional committee has asked Canada to reevaluate its ban on cruises, which prohibits ships from sailing in Canadian waters until March 2022.On Wednesday, the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure sent a letter to Canadian ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman, hoping to ""encourage"" the Canadian government to work with the U.S. government and the cruise industry to find a ""mutually agreeable solution.""In the letter, the committee expressed its ""concern regarding the potential economic impact on local businesses and communities,"" saying that ""by closing Canadian ports to passenger vessels for another year, the livelihoods of tens of thousands of Americans and Canadians are at risk from more job losses and further economic devastation.""Canada's ban not only impacts ships in Canadian waters, it also puts a roadblock in the way of cruises in Alaska, New England, Washington state or the Great Lakes. Ocean cruise ships have not sailed in U.S. waters since last March.- ADVERTISEMENT -U.S. maritime law requires international stops on ships flagged in foreign countries, which includes many major cruise lines' ships.Because of this, many of the cruises scheduled to sail in U.S. waters in areas such as Alaska would need to stop at a port in Canada, which is not permitted by the country's ban. Many cruise lines, including Holland America and Princess Cruises, have already canceled their Alaska seasons as a result.To address the situation, the committee suggested allowing stops at Canadian ports without passengers disembarking, noting that could minimize COVID-19 risk Canada is concerned about.The letter is signed by Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., who is chair of the committee; ranking member Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo.; Rep. Salud Carbajal, D-Calif., who is the chair of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation; ranking member Rep. Bob Gibbs, R-Ohio, who is also on the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation; and Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska..Cruise Lines International Association, the leading cruise industry organization, thanked committee members for facilitating dialogue with the Canadian government, in a statement provided by Bari Golin-Blaugrund, vice president of strategic communications for CLIA.""CLIA looks forward to working with the Canadian and U.S. authorities on a solution that addresses the public health needs of Americans and Canadians alike, while responsibly restarting a critical economic driver for the Pacific Northwest and Alaska,"" CLIA said.This isn't the first initiative taken by members of Congress in the face of the ban. Shortly after it was issued, Young and Alaska Republican Reps. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan issued a joint statement explaining that the ban was ""unexpected"" and ""unacceptable"" since it came without warning.""We expect more from our Canadian allies,"" the statement said. “Upon hearing the announcement, we immediately reached out to Canadian and American agencies to try to understand the rationale behind this decision – particularly the duration of the ban. We are exploring all potential avenues, including changing existing laws, to ensure the cruise industry in Alaska resumes operations as soon as it is safe. We will fight to find a path forward.”",0.9925

CEO expects to resume US sailing before year endMorgan Hines, USA TODAYThu, October 8, 2020, 10:12 AM PDTArnold Donald, the CEO of Carnival Corp., expects that the company's cruise lines will be sailing by the end of the year in U.S. waters after a more-than-seven-month pause in operations.""At this time we have every reason to be optimistic that we will be sailing in the U.S. before year end,"" Donald said on an earnings call Thursday. He added later that because of the success of initial sailings in Europe, the company believes it has a ""way to go forward"" amid the COVID-19 pandemic that continues to impact countries worldwide, including the United States which has seen more than 210,000 people die from the disease.Carnival Corp. lines, which is parent to Carnival Cruise Line, Holland America, Princess Cruises, P&O Cruises, among others, are taking a staggered approach to resuming operations as previously promised by the cruise company. One has already resumed operations: Costa Cruises, which resumed sailing two of its ships in Italy, made its first comeback voyage on Sept. 6. A second, AIDA Cruises is scheduled to follow suit in Italy beginning Oct. 17.Costa Cruises has not seen a single case of COVID-19 on board its ships in the more than a month-long period that it has been sailing, Roger Frizzell, spokesperson for Carnival Corp., told USA TODAY Thursday.""Our company is uniquely positioned for phased resumption given multiple national brands, which can each be restarted independently,"" Donald said.The restart of Costa has proven valuable as other Carnival Corp. lines plan for their return to U.S. waters: ""We plan to leverage the experience and learnings from both Costa Cruises and AIDA, as well as ongoing input from our science and medical experts as part of the process,"" Frizzell told USA TODAY.For instance, AIDA will adapt Costa's new dining room plans, converting self-service dining areas to full-service restaurants. Costa's contactless process allows passengers to choose a table and review their food choices on a menu that is conveniently available on their mobile device using a QR code. Then, a waiter wearing a face mask takes their order and delivers it to the table.When will Carnival cruise ships return to the US?While both the CDC's ""no-sail"" order and Cruise Lines International Association's (CLIA) voluntary suspension are scheduled to end on Oct. 31, two of Carnival's Corp's biggest lines have canceled cruises beyond that date.Last week, its flagship Carnival canceled all remaining 2020 cruises except those departing out of its home ports in Miami and Port Canaveral, Florida – and acknowledged those might not even happen. Meanwhile, Princess has extended its operational pause through Dec. 15.When cruising comes back, will the buffet return with it? Here's what the cruise lines sayHow US cruising on a Carnival Corp. line might look when it returnsAll Carnival Corp. cruise lines that are subject to the CDC's ""no-sail"" order, or ships that have capacity for more than 250 passengers, are also subject to a set of new CLIA protocols, which include requirements for face masks, testing and physical distancing.But many of the details, Donald said, for example, the kind of testing they will employ for all passengers, are still being worked out.New, mandatory COVID-19 precautions for cruise lines: Testing, masks, ventilationLooking ahead, Carnival Corp. has seen demand for bookings in the second half of 2021.""While the company believes bookings in the first half of 2021 reflect expectations of the phased resumption of its guest cruise operations and anticipated itinerary changes, as of September 20, 2020, cumulative advanced bookings for the second half of 2021 capacity currently available for sale are at the higher end of the historical range,"" Carnival Corp. said in its third quarter business update.This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Carnival Corp. expects to cruise in US in 2020: 'A way to go forward'",0.9986

(Photo: Getty)The optimism can be pinpointed to the vaccine — with 42% of respondents saying the vaccine news made them hopeful about travel or prompted them to book a trip.Travelers plan to spend an average of $3,444, while millennials are ready to drop more — $5,462 on each trip. Many Americans intend on getting away for longer, with 1 in 3 travelers planning a trip that lasts a week or longer.“People are planning to travel more this year than they did even pre-pandemic,” Murphy said, “which is a very encouraging insight and a good signal for travel recovery.”Considering Cancun and London rank among the top destinations where Americans have begun booking trips, according to the survey, maintaining global health is a shared priority for passengers and countries, Murphy said.",0.9967

4709,"CCL is a pure gamble, and will likely go down - if people took time to read their financials, they do not look good. Reasons are as followed:1) company owes close to 2.5 billion by 2020 ( this is factoring that new ships are covered by their existing credit facility) - all remaining debts will likely be covered with the 6billion of financing. Which is fine. (They can survive for 10months - yippee)2) let’s say for the grace of god that Covid 19 dies out by June, and they are able to start sailing by late June (unlikely) - people keep forgetting that it will take time for the economy to slowly start running up again (at least 6-9months) and with the higher unemployment rate and the lingering fears of Covid 19 - do you believe people will likely vacation on a cruise for the rest of 2020?? It took 6 years for the airlines to recover from historic highs after 911!! Pretty sure covid 19 has surpassed that event (pretty sure “most” people will be hesitant stepping on a cruise) However, even if 2021, 2022 and 2023 goes back to normal (just to be an optimist let’s say their revenues are back at around 20billion) and go back to around 2019 levels! we have to factor that they owe roughly 5.75billion by 2023 (might be less if convertible holders decide to exercise their right to own equity) but we need to factor their existing debt before covid 19 -which is another whopping 7billion ( this is not even including the ships they promised to pay - which I’m not even factoring) ...so let’s recap, we have 5.75 billion + 7billion = 12.75billion due by 2023. And we are assuming sales for 2021, 2022, and 2023 are back at 20billion “sales”. Here’s the fun part- let’s say they are able to have a new profit margin of 10% (which is still highly unlikely due to the 11.5% borrowing on interest, and they have already cut fare tickets for for 2021 and 2022 to attract customers!) that gives the net profit for the 3 years around 6 billion (2 billion each year). As you can see, there is still a shortfall - they still cant pay the 12.75 billion they owe by 2023. Now what can the company do? Either try and refinance by 2023 - but the management even is unclear and is doubtful they will be able to attain refinancing. Or they can sell ships (but who will honestly buy cruise ships!? ...other cruise companies of course...oh wait, RCL and Norwegian are in worse financial shape that CCL (so unlikely they will sale to competitors) so maybe scrap metal - which will put the value of these ships at a good 70% discount from the balance sheet figures.End of the day, I highly doubt CCl will weather the storm in the next 3 years - I thinkequity investors will get wiped out, and the bond holders will continue to own the company.
