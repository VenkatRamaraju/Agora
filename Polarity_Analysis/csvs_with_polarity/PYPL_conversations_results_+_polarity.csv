50,"I was probably the biggest bull on this NIO board and in my account from June 2020 until a couple of weeks after NIO day. I did not short this stock, because it is against my principles, but I knew it would tank. I liked the secondary offerings , which I thought they were going to deploy their war chest on expansion in every area. The factory issue is pathetic. The raised about $5Billion of our American dollars and seem content to sit on it. That turned me off, and when you combine legacy autos deploying cash for the EV sector, they have lost a great deal of momentum and trust. Now, I get the tech trades are suffering. I recently moved into $PYPL which has taken a whipping with the overall NASDAQ, but I am sorry, I will stay with PYPL and shun this. The cash in PYPL is real, the expansion is real and their massive revenues are equating to strong earnings. It may be rocky for a while, but $PYPL will bust out after this down cycle to new highs.NIO, once my favorite tech play has been very disappointing, and questionable what they are doing with cash.To my long term NIOites on this board, I issue this caution out of loyalty to you. Remember the November dilution. The locked up shares awarded to those that brought the secondary to market in November, free up late this month. Be careful as the float expands and more shares hit the market.Once again, very disappointed in NIO and am someone suspect on all these cash raises via dilution. Just wanted to remind those about the unlocked shares coming to market in a couple of weeks.I feel better in $PYPL and will have some exposure to China through their arrangements with Alipay.I hope it works out with NIO, but please proceed with caution. Good luck to all on my former board hangout.NIO owes me nothing, I did great with them.I hope to see some of you around, and NIO does deploy some of the cash they raised from the American equity market.",0.9971

165,Backed up the truck today and loaded. My PYPL stake is now 5 percent greater than prior to the market selloff. PYPL's cash flow in 5 years according to the CEO will be double what it is now. Increasing cash flows are one of the metrics I like to see when investing in a company. Rising rates can drive a company down near term but in 5 years they will do little to dim a company's prospects. Take advantage of this selloff longs. Also loaded up on SQ. PYPL is going back to 300 and then it will take out 400. Below 250 is dirt cheap.,0.931

172,The Hedgies had a nice profit and they sold to show some profit. It is fun to be on a stock that they love at the moment but we must remember they as a group are far worse than the small investor. They have to take profits where they can by quarters end to substantiate their 2 and 20 program which will go away. They cause what can be marketed as a rotation occasionally. The best thing you can do is buy the dips that they cause if the company is performing.I believe this company is performing very well and the new acquisitions are smoking the revenue growth.I will stand on my 125 call.,0.987
173,Added,0.0
174,"Yet another reason PayPal; may become a potential takeover candidate.... the announcement that PayPal is now the first foreign corporation licensed to process payments in China. Why a takeover possibility? 1. Share prices artifically (IMHO) depressed. 2.

245,"Howdy. Been a while since i posted on this board. I just reviewed the long term chart on PYPL and have an interesting perspective. In April 2017 the stock was at 40. Today the stock is at 104. I've owned it since 39 and am obviously pleased. But during the last 24 months, the markets have had some wild times and there's been hurdles to overcome for PYPL such as eBay and new competition, etc. Seen comments on this board expressing frustration over stock performance, etc., and i have to admit i was frustrated at times as well. But after all these experiences, the stock is up over 150% in 24 months. If we fast forward to April 2021, and experienced the same growth of 150%, the stock would be over 250/share. I doubt we would have any complaints about that result, and i'm sure there will be many ups and downs along the way, just like the last 24 months. Being in this stock has taught me patience and to ignore lots of ""noise"" in the marketplace. I wish all the longs the best of luck; for me, i'm holding on for the long term and can only hope for another 150% in 24 months! IMHO GLTA",0.9913

265,"PayPal is still in its early innings. Many people get worried about competitors, but remember a rising tide raises all. Nearly a quarter of the world's population remains unbanked due to restrictions imposed by traditional banks. PayPal is just starting to provide services to the unbanked in the States; but the main beneficiaries will be third world countries with high mobile penetration and solid base of young early adopters. This alone will drive growth for several years as the global payments market is huge and PayPal has a massive lead on potential competitors. It should be noted that PayPal is continuously working to open up in many countries. For instance, it is likely that PayPal will be made available in Pakistan this year - this is a country with a population of 200 million people and is just one of many examples! We in the West mistakenly believe that the likes of Amazon, etc. can take a big slice of the payments market just like that; this is absolutely not true. It takes years to conform with the banking regulations of individual countries - hence providing a great opportunity and a financial moat for PayPal.

For growth stocks such as these, I look at top and bottom line growth year over year as well as over the past several years. In addition, I look to compound annual growth rate, gross profit growth, gross margins, etc. So let's dive into PYPL's growth metrics shall we? If you look at PYPL's revenue over the last several years, it has been increasing by roughly $2-$4 billion dollars a year, from $11 billion in 2015 to $21.5 billion in 2021. So revenues have doubled over the last 6 years. Gross profit has also grown substantially year over year. From 2015-2021, gross profit doubled as well. EBITDA grew explosively as well, from $2 billion in 2015 to $5 billion this year. Cash and cash equivalents have grown at an astounding rate too over that time period, increasing every year. Free cash flow also increased 2.5 times from 2015 to this year, more astounding growth. And over the next 5 years it is expected to do that again. Earnings growth rate over the next 5 years is an impressive 22 percent. Market implied 5 year EPS compound annual growth rate is an impressive 27 percent.

1144,"PayPal: Helping make digital payments the standardOne of the trends that got a significant boost as a result of the pandemic was the shift toward digital payments. This was partially the result of increased adoption of e-commerce, but it was also due to the pressing desire for touchless payments as people and businesses looked for ways to reduce the chances of customer interactions spreading the coronavirus. No fintech company is better positioned to benefit from that ongoing change in consumer behavior than PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL).The digital payments pioneer was already thriving, but COVID-19 kicked its growth into overdrive. PayPal moved quickly to roll out QR codes to provide additional touch-free payment options.In the first quarter, PayPal added more than 20 million net new accounts, as its growth rate on that metric rose 17%. This brought its total to 325 million accounts, and that could be just the beginning. The company reported that after the close of the first quarter, it saw dramatic gains in transactions throughout April, and adoption and engagement trends accelerated in May.""I would argue that April was probably the strongest month for PayPal since we became a public company,"" said CEO Dan Schulman in a May interview with MarketWatch. That strength continued into May as PayPal reported the largest single day of transactions in the company's history -- beating out 2019's Black Friday and Cyber Monday results. Digital payments are the future, and PayPal is helping pull that future into the present.",0.9961

It is entirely possible that PYPL could reach several hundred or even higher in the next few years. Selling here would be very foolish. If the stock is over 200 in 2019, wouldn't 76 look cheap?

1291,"MF article is a must read. As the cliche’ goes, “ Steady Eddie always wins the race.”‘PayPal is expecting revenue to increase 20% to 25% in the fourth quarter and TPV and earnings per share to grow double-digits. These are strong numbers, but they don't match growth from newer start-ups like Square. But PayPal's revenue far exceeds Square's, and sales growth around 20% is healthy for a company its size. That typically means less vigorous stock growth, but lower risk. This explains why Square is up more than 200% year to date and PayPal is up about 100%, which isn't too shabby. But Square trades at 330 times trailing 12- month earnings, while PayPal trades at 81 times earnings. PayPal has an established brand and high long-term growth prospects. It faces some competition, but it stands out with its large network and innovative payment solutions. I would say that PayPal is a low-risk stock with the potential for high gains for shareholders.’",0.9927

1331,"View WatchlistPayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) shares rose more than 2% on Friday after the company confirmed that it would acquire iZettle in a $2.2 billion all-cash deal. The move is significant because it marks PayPal's entry into the point-of-sale transaction business, which puts it in direct competition with Square, Inc. (SQ) and Intuit Inc. (INTU). At the same time, the company’s core business has been very robust ahead of its investor day coming up on Thursday, May 24.iZettle was previously gearing up for its own initial public offering, in which it planned to raise $227 million, valuing it at about $1.1 billion. The company is one of the largest payment processors in Europe and has operations in 12 markets, including Northern Europe, Mexico and the United Kingdom. With shares trading higher, the market appears to see many synergies in the business despite the lofty acquisition multiple.

I know this stock better than most of you.Real_Stacey KronchReal_Stacey Kronch17 hours ago$NIO conversationI was probably the biggest bull on this NIO board and in my account from June 2020 until a couple of weeks after NIO day. I did not short this stock, because it is against my principles, but I knew it would tank. I liked the secondary offerings , which I thought they were going to deploy their war chest on expansion in every area. The factory issue is pathetic. The raised about $5Billion of our American dollars and seem content to sit on it. That turned me off, and when you combine legacy autos deploying cash for the EV sector, they have lost a great deal of momentum and trust. Now, I get the tech trades are suffering. I recently moved into $PYPL which has taken a whipping with the overall NASDAQ, but I am sorry, I will stay with PYPL and shun this. The cash in PYPL is real, the expansion is real and their massive revenues are equating to strong earnings. It may be rocky for a while, but $PYPL will bust out after this down cycle to new highs.NIO, once my favorite tech play has been very disappointing, and questionable what they are doing with cash.To my long term NIOites on this board, I issue this caution out of loyalty to you. Remember the November dilution. The locked up shares awarded to those that brought the secondary to market in November, free up late this month. Be careful as the float expands and more shares hit the market.Once again, very disappointed in NIO and am someone suspect on all these cash raises via dilution. Just wanted to remind those about the unlocked shares coming to market in a couple of weeks.I feel better in $PYPL and will have some exposure to China through their arrangements with Alipay.I hope it works out with NIO, but please proceed with caution.

High and growing revenue has attracted investment cash, and PayPal boasts a market cap of nearly $228 billion.Despite everything that has hit the markets this year, 2020 is turning out to be a great year for the company. Q1 revenue and EPS dipped, but not deeply, and both turned back upwards in Q2. The second quarter top line was $5.26 billion, with earnings of 76 cents per share, the highest in more than two years. Share prices are up, as well, with PYPL gaining an impressive 80% year-to-date.Generally rising volumes of online sales, and the concomitant need for digital payment services, provide a continuing boost for PayPal’s income and share position.Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane put a $234 price target on PYPL, suggesting a 20% one-year upside, and rates the stock a Buy.

I think many of us (myself included) were thinking this was the quarter that would start the next round UP into the high $90-110 range. Unfortunately this has been an embarrising quarter to report with revenue miss. Yes we have added a significant new amount of users but it does take some time for most of those users to become acclimated into using PayPal in increasing transactions. That will take some time for results to be felt. In addition, while there have been significant acqusitions the most important, iZettle continues to be reviewed by the EU for possible ""loss of competition"" rules. Therefore, without significant increase in revenue, without really knowing the total amount of shres repurchased, and without any jolt to the stock in terms of a special dividend (thus allowing possible inclusion into certain mutual funds) we shareholders are faced with the fact that PayPal is a stock that will continue to plod along with its share price until we can see a SIGNIFICANT new growth in both users and revenues. I have predicted a stock price of $110-$114 by the anniversary of the IPO for this year but I am now concerned that we will not achieve that level this year. However, all is not lost. We will continue to see slow incremental increases in the stock price over this year just not the home run many of us where hoping and expecting.",0.9955

It may well be this is why they are so worried about interest rates going up even a little. It may be possible that their loans are not so good.

PayPal overpaid to get into the space where they already tried two home grown solutions and failed. PayPal is the company beset on all sides, not Square, and this acquisition is defensive. Square has totally wrecked PYPL in this sphere (ever see PYPL's competition? The PayPal Here Triangle-dongle? Or see their registers in a store?)So this isn't a reason for Square to be worried, it's $PYPL admitting defeat and buying something at a big premium in the hopes of re-entering a market. It's a signal of failure on PYPL's part.On the other side of the competition, Venmo (another PYPL acquisition) had a huge lead but Square's home-grown Cash App has been #1 in finance apps for all of 2018 so far.PayPal has not had a home-grown success in years. Their reputation among small sellers is bad, and they would be wise to keep their name off of iZettle if they want it to be successful (like they did with Venmo for a long time). But iZettle on its own has no name recognition. It is PayPal, and not Square, fighting the uphill battle here.Finally, compare each company's services with the other and see who offers more. Does iZettle do payroll? Appointments and booking? Employee management? Or is it only a register?

I was very fortunate that I chose these two stocks. Ever since I read articles and news because of these two stocks, I became more interested in cryptocurrency/bitcoin. There are hundreds of different cryptocurrencies out ithere but one of them got me very interested which was Ripple/XRP. As a long time pypl stock holder, I wanted to let you guys a heads up on a investment opportunity in this XRP currency. If you guys wanna know more about it, check their website and search youtube videos.I've already invested $20k into this cryptocurrency market since last week. I am 40 years old and tried my best to make a best living out of my life and after working all these years, I have saved a little more than $150k and I still can't even buy a house yet. Since I live in LA, the house market inflation is so terrible and I just don't think it is possible for me to buy at least a house. It would probably happen when I become 50 or even older or never. There's a Korean saying ""If you were born rich because your dad is rich, you were born with a gold spoon in your mouth"" but I was born with wooden spoon. Even if I lose this investment. I am still remaining as a wooden spoon with or without $20k. :)",0.9977

It’s healthy for the market, as long as it doesn’t transform into a panic crash. The trend line for Pypl is still solidly bullish, with a spike and drop ‘correction’ during February off a very bullish trendline over the last year that we are still well within on a slow stochastic basis... Nothing has fundamentally changed; the government is still printing money with a lot more to come very soon, we are still at near zero interest rates, and Pypl is still making money hand over fist on crypto.The scary trend is the treasury yield rising over the last few months, so we need to keep a close eye on that trend which can cause a panic selloff if this continues too long and that yield gets too high.I am not panicking.

PYPL, -2.28% to his firm's ""best ideas"" list on Friday and raised his price target on PayPal's stock to $100 from $90. With the price-target increase, Katri becomes one of the two most bullish analysts tracked by FactSet.

4143,"PYPL is very overvalued for some investors, but they are the same people that did not understand the internet in 1999, or so they claimed. Yes, these large investors, only can make money if they have information, by ""talking"" to the C.E.O.'s of companies. For them this is a matter of opinion, they will tell you that in the 1950's and 1960's insider information was not even looked into, so for them the culture continues and they old boy network makes sure they don't go away to prison. So PYPL for such investors is not going to be a lucrative trade, as they make money in one go, and advise the rest of us to buy and hold. The only way to make money like this is to create targets. They make money by having a definite result, and fight against momentum as part of their plan. In the near term they will bash PYPL because it the lowering guidance though not even significant was done at the earning conference. It is even suspicious why hypothetical guidance that to of 1% would be stated. It seems a window was created to lower stock prices on purpose. But after this, PYPL will continue to be more profitable and of course buyout more competitors. In the short term the stock may test 95 or even 90 but then it will bounce back to 110 and above. Hopefully enough investors can see through the smoke and realize that growth story does not end simply because of 200 billion in tariffs on a 14 trillion dollar economy. Again this is not even 1.5% of China's G.D.P. And this is done at a full 25% of all of China's exports to the U.S. the real amount will be less even at full scale trade war. So perhaps a pattern of manipulation can be seen very clearly.",0.9918

4814,"An expanded Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) relationship is mutually beneficial and could be a game-changer for PayPal, according to MoffettNathanson.“Facebook and PayPal are natural partners. They’re both successful internet disruptors focused on facilitating online commerce – Facebook through advertising, PayPal through payments,” analyst Lisa Ellis wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.After a 13-year marriage, eBay (EBAY) and PayPal divorced in 2015. According to Ellis, a new relationship with a major tech, financial or payments company could benefit PayPal greatly. “[It] could create step-function growth in PayPal’s user base, merchant base, geographic footprint, or omni-channel capabilities, and are only possible now that PayPal is free of the constraints of the eBay relationship.”As for Facebook, the tech giant has been under intense scrutiny as a result of misinformation and privacy concerns, and the stock has suffered as a consequence. Shares of Facebook have tanked more than 18% in 2018. Facebook needs a new narrative, and an expanded partnership with PayPal could get the company back in the good graces of investors, according to Ellis.Despite all of the headwinds facing Facebook, Ellis explained that investors are ignoring the company’s e-commerce growth opportunities. “With over 6 million advertisers and 2.6 billion people using at least one of Facebook’s four leading products, they have the potential to develop a world leading eCommerce platform – but, given Facebook’s lack of in-house expertise, need a partner(s) to help,” Ellis argued.Among those four-leading Facebook products is Instagram. The platform has been a force to be reckoned with this year, dethroning Snapchat (SNAP) as the most-used app by teens, according to a survey by Piper Jaffray.Facebook and PayPal have had a partnership since 2016. Facebook users are able to use PayPal to shop on Facebook Messenger and Marketplace; however, Ellis outlined three possible expanded partnership scenarios between PayPal and Facebook.The first option involves the integration of a payment function within WhatsApp. According to Ellis, in order to better compete with rival WeChat, allowing payments on WhatsApp will help drive user engagement. “Even if only 5% of the 1.3B WhatsApp users (whom do not overlap with PayPal) are converted, PayPal would capture 65M new users – a 28% growth in its base,” Ellis said.Secondly, tapping into powerhouse Instagram would potentially be a smart move for PayPal. Instagram has around 1 billion users, and an expanded PayPal partnership with the platform will allow Instagram users to stay engaged on the platform and shop without leaving the app. “If only 5% of 0.8B Instagram users (who do not overlap with PayPal) are converted, PayPal would capture 40M new users – a 17% growth in its base. PayPal would also realize incremental payment processing volume and revenue from processing Instagram transactions.”Lastly, Ellis argues that there could be a more aggressive partnership between PayPal and Facebook’s Marketplace. While currently there is a limited number of people that actually make transactions through Marketplace, an extended partnership with PayPal could help boost that number, according to Ellis.“We believe the conditions are in place for Facebook and PayPal to pursue one or more of these partnership options over the next 6-12 months,” Ellis said.",0.9992

4881,"PayPal: Growth on SaleBY MarketWatch— 2:43 PM ET 10/21/2018PayPal ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) shares have sold off sharply in the recent market correction, bringing its valuation down to more reasonable levels. Meanwhile, the payment company's growth story just got more compelling.PayPal ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) reported solid quarterly earnings Thursday. Revenue rose 14% from a year earlier, slowing from 23% growth the prior quarter, but this was largely due to the sale of a loan portfolio. Excluding this, revenue growth was a robust 21% , in line with the pace of previous quarters. Earnings per share rose 17%, beating analyst estimates, and the company raised guidance for the rest of the year.At the moment, this growth is mainly driven by increasing use of PayPal's ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) convenient checkout button to pay for online purchases. PayPal ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) doesn't break out how much of its revenue comes from this channel, but MoffettNathanson estimates it accounted for 86% last year. These analysts aren't worried about excessive reliance, though, figuring that checkout- button volumes can keep growing by 20% a year for the next three years.On Thursday, PayPal ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) also provided fresh disclosures showing that it is gaining traction on other revenue sources important to its future. Braintree, its payments-acceptance platform used by merchants like Grubhub(GRUB) and Stitch Fix, processed 1.64 billion transactions in the third quarter, up 33% from a year earlier.Most crucially, the company is making progress figuring out how to make money (https://www.wsj.com/articles/paypal- show-me-the-venmo-money-1517501786) on Venmo, its payment app that is popular with young users. Chief Executive Dan Schulman said 24% of Venmo users have now used the app in a way that generated money for the company, a so-called monetizable action. That is up from 17% in the second quarter. This includes using Venmo to pay for goods and services from a merchant, ""instant transfers"" of Venmo balances to users' bank accounts and uses of the new Venmo-branded debit card.The company gave no details on how much revenue it is earning from either Braintree or Venmo--disclosures that investors would appreciate. But the figures it did cite are enough to demonstrate that PayPal ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) isn't just a checkout- button story.Before reporting Thursday, PayPal's ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) stock was down 17% from its September high, wringing some excess optimism (https:/ /www.wsj.com/articles/why-paypal-investors-felt-shortchanged-1532599200) out of the valuation. It now trades at 28 times forward earnings, in line with its average multiple since becoming an independent company and down sharply from 37 times at the start of this year.The recent market selloff has hit many payment stocks--a particularly highflying corner of the market. But PayPal ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) is no Square, which still fetches 105 times forward earnings (https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-its-less-hip-to-be-square- 1539095847). This pullback creates a rare opportunity to snap up an exciting growth stock at what is now a reasonable price.",0.9988

What is happening now is no different than what has happened in prior earnings reports. A run up to new highs and then a pullback after earnings come out. The only difference to this pullback as opposed to the others is that the board has OK'ed the $10 billion buyback increase.

The card companies, banks, and even Google have been thrown out as possibilities. While I agree that Paypal may be an acquisition target, my belief is that it may come from private equity firms wanting to take Paypal back private. Ridiculous you say. Not so fast. Paypal was a private entity right after it was spun off from Ebya. Why can't it be again? After all, all it would take is for a bid of say $85, a nearly 16% premium at today's closing price and then the company and its new partners could go back to being a private concern without having to worry about stupid, idiotic, market manipulations like yesterday's closing absurdity. I would gladly sign up with any equity group wanting to make that deal. Imagine not having to worry about losing market share in one day what a month of great news has brought us. After all, the financials for Paypal have not changed one iota but we see this drop because of a bogy man mentality! $85 too cheap you say?

5686,"I truly believe that Venmo has the potential to turn PayPal into the next Apple. Venmo has made cash irrelevant in person-to-person transactions, which isn’t surprising, as paper money is incredibly inefficient by comparison. With Venmo you never need to wait for someone to hit the ATM or make change, and there’s never any payment disputes because the app automatically records transactions on both sides of the trade, (blockchain?!)The question is, how does PayPal monetize Venmo? Management has talked about opening the platform to businesses and earning revenue from transaction fees like credit card companies. This is a potentially huge source of income, as I believe people would quickly adopt Venmo for business purchases for the same reasons it’s used for p2p transfers: efficiency and convenience. Eventually Venmo will replace debit/credit cards as the #1 payment form, because why wouldn’t it? I already use my phone for everything, why not paying for things? As Venmo takes off, people will start holding cash balances within their Venmo account, rather than immediately transferring money to their banks. This represents another novel revenue opportunity in the form of the interest PayPal could earn on these cash balances. Given the billions of dollars in transactions being processed through Venmo today, the total cash balances held at any given time by app-users must be enormous.Thoughts?",0.9903

6590,"Hold or Buy....Don't Sell!!! MM is #$%$ you out of your stock. """"""If you remember from when we first told you about it, we were in PayPal primarily for Venmo. Venmo is PayPal?s app that is widely used by millennials. Venmo, in this last quarter, did $10.4 billion in transactions. This is 86% growth compared to last year. That?s crazy good growth! And exactly what we expected and want to see.And generally, PayPal?s business is booming, with its profits skyrocketing higher by 59% compared to last year.Now, if you look at the stock, you?ll see it?s down by almost 6%. You might be surprised by this. If you listened to this week?s podcast, I told you that hedge funds and market makers use news to get people to panic and sell stocks they want to go down. And that?s exactly what we have going on today.You see, PayPal announced that eBay, which used to own PayPal before it became an independent, separate company, is going to phaseout using it as the default payment system between 2020 and 2023.Right now, around 22% of PayPal?s 2016 revenue comes from eBay?s platform. That?s down from 26% in 2015 and 29% in 2014. PayPal CEO Dan Schulman, in a conference call to discuss the quarter, said that the loss of part of its business with eBay would be ?quite manageable,? and had been assumed for some time. John Rainey, PayPal?s CFO, told investors that the eBay business is low growth and low margin for their company, and that it?s a drag on profitability. Finally, they expect that the lost eBay business will be more than made up from recently signed agreements for PayPal with Disney, Home Depot and QVC. Bottom line, hold on to your PayPal stock. Today?s decline is just one more instance of market makers trying to get you to panic and sell your stock to them on the cheap.You know what happens next. Once all the people who are going to sell are done, the market makers will go to sell the stock you sold them for higher prices.""""""""",0.9918

Terry McAuliffe’s political action committee donated nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe--the wife of an FBI official who helped oversee the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state, Hillary lies to the FBI on her servers, she deletes 33,000 emails after she receives a subpoena, a State department senior offical tries to bribe the FBI to declassify some of Hillary's emails, her IT staff takes the 5th amendment rather than tesitfy to Congress on erasing the servers, the pay for play Clinton Foundation, the rigged Deomcratic primaries, and now the FBI has reopened the email investigation. It just goes on and on with the corruption in this election. Sadly today, being politically correct ""trumps"" corruption, fraud and lying with many, especially for those under 40.Here's another example of the hypocrisy of the Press, the Neoliberals and the Democrats. Bubba Clinton stating in 1996 that Americans are rightfully disturbed by the illegal number of Aliens.
