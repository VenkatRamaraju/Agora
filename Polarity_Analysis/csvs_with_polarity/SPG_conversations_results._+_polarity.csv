1,Buying JCPenney is not going to work out because JC penny is going down as a retailer similar to Sears. It is a dying business. My guess is JC Penney might have some prime real estate that Simon might use for other purposes. Perhaps Simon got JC for very cheap price,0.9263
2,"What is most surprising is that any longs are surprised here. The list of bankruptcies continues to grow while SPG continues to extend it's exposure. Offices trending toward hybrid use of workspace and concurrent reduction of office sizes will only add to the commercial market inventory, another negative for SPG. Potential rent alternatives continue to vanish. And, as I've said before, look up CO-TENANCY CLAUSE in commercial leases. Buy at 40 and hold for a decade.",0.8077

37,"People can make money on SPG short and long. The truth is nobody knows exactly how things will unfold, I can only say that the shops of SPG were I shop are still quite crowded (but less than before). Why? The outlets that Simon Property owns are in locations that have a huge attraction because it is not only a mall but also an experience. This is the situation in Europe, in USA they are lagging behind. Data is showing a new norm of 80% in asian countries (SPG also owns some), 60%-70% in Europe (slowly crawling up) and USA sub 60% (lagging like hell). The more regulation there is on wearing mask, and cleaning hands, the better. USA needs to step up its hand cleaning and social distancing game. I hope SPG keeps the dividends low, looks for opportunities, and keeps the cashflow in check; the moves they did so far I really like. I think the reason most sold out of SPG is the dividend cut and the uncertainty surrounding Covid 19.There will most likely be a second and third wave. The second wave in US seems to have already started when the first wave was not finished. The third wave is likely to be a lot less impactfull (I analysed previous pandemics).Shopping malls and outlets are part of a costumer experience and will keep attracting people. Small locations will attract even fewer people than before is my expectation.You can increase this stock price! How?

I don't see any signs of consumer confidence coming back to Sand Lake (which I drive daily). Tourism is nonexistent (traffic is amazing) and the surrounding area cannot support that mall, especially its high end stores. Dine in restaurants are reopening, but even in one of the free states people are being super cautious and have averaged 4-10 tables seated at a time at the average Chilis.

377,"I just bought a few shares of Simon this morning. Malls will survive. The best will survive the best because of management and locations. Even amazon has resorted to brick and mortar for a very good reason. People still want to buy merchandise immediately and touch and see it before purchase, try on a new pair of shoes. Of course they will evolve into something else that nobody can visualize over time. I’ve watched a Simon property do just that over the years. Lately it has changed even faster. Just like the S&P 500 has a turnover of 35% every decade, so will a mall. For every penny’s or Neiman Marcus that bite the dust there will be another up and coming company that no one has heard of before. There’s no longer a penny’s or radio shack there but there is a Tesla showroom next to Nordstrom and an Amazon bookstore. Who would have thought that they would now exist 10 years ago. Many more changes occurred and will occur in the future. Many tout that there’s just too much retail square footage. I don’t think so. Population increases produce demand. I want to find something locally at a good price. My next purchase is going to be a 10 foot drinking water safe leader hose made by flexilla. Guess where I’m buying it. It’s not at amazon or eBay.

Excluding the Q3 2020 provision for bad debts of $13.4 million, Q3 2020 FFO would have been $0.46 per Unit, an increase of $0.03 per Unit compared to Q3 2019. AFFO per Unit was $0.35 in Q3 2020 compared to $0.29 in Q2 2020 and $0.35 in Q3 2019. Distributions paid as a percentage of AFFO was 49.0% in Q3 2020, resulting in significant retained cash flow. ""Let's take the 41 cent number, which I believe is low. 41 cents x 4 quarters = 1.64Price to FFO is around 7.7. That is ridiculous.Now remove bad debts (CECRA replaced by CERS, so bad debts will drop), factor in rising contractual rents, higher new leases, improvements in rentals from Jackson Park, and FFO from all their just launched developments such as River Landing, and likely have FFO around .46 to .50. At the mid end .48, price to FFO is around 6.6.Worst case, bad debts get worse, leasing of new properties falls apart, CERS support is stopped, and we are looking at FFO around .38/quarter. That works out to a price to FFO around 8.3.

602,"I have been a commercial broker, specializing in retail, for 20+ years and malls are not ""dead"". Totally different situation now, obviously, vs. the great recession. However, even 11 years ago, I frequented several malls, including one in Atlanta (which was supposedly ""dead) while visiting for a wedding. I have also been taking the time to check the parking lots of malls in the areas I specialize in, which include Colorado, Utah, Idaho, and Northern/Southern California. On weekdays, these parking lots (especially in Utah and Colorado over the last 2 months) have been 75% - 85% full. On weekends, they have all been 100% full, with side streets packed with overflow. Yes, online shopping is here to stay and I, myself, am a Prime addict to a fault. However, there is an intrinsic value that shoppers place on visiting shopping centers. People want to get out, try on clothes, touch and see the items they're interested in...and don't discount the 'people watching' aspect of in-person shopping, especially at malls. This was all noted early on in Europe back in Feb. - April during some of the strictest lockdowns anywhere (besides China, of course). People were quoted as saying that they want to get out...to shop, to eat, to socialize, etc. and, most importantly, to spend their money! I can't speak for the east and midwest, but in the mountain states and west coast, driving and walking around over the last 60 days can be explained as ""business as usual"", especially in the mountain states. A vaccine/stimulus combo will set brick and mortar retail into a hyperdrive as never before seen...mark my word. As a side note, don't 'discount' bank stocks. Never in history has an economic recovery been possible without, you guessed it, banks. Borrowing, regardless of record low interest rates, has been off the charts, mainly for single family and multi-family purchases and new developments (just take a drive around the greater Denver and Salt Lake City markets and you will see more new apartment projects than you could ever even imagine...the next decade will be a market of renters (due to home pricing, lack of inventory, and those with less than stellar credit), along with first time home buyers...it began post great recession and is at warp speed now.",0.9947

That is an dilution of 6.6% to existing share holders. New Diluted EPS with taubman $9.46. Take away 6.6%. Gives existing shareholders $8.84 in EPS. An increase in EPS of $2.03!

The stock lost 70% from it is very recent level. In the pother words an upside is huge (100-150%). What those crooks are doing now? They are controlling the price while accumulating shares. How low they can drop a stock? Who knows but I doubt they can do it below 45. Move up as always will be fast, starts between sessions (say ""suddenly"" opens 10-15% up) and then within 3-5 trading days a price can be almost doubled e.g. from 45-50 to 80-90. If it is a case what a difference does it make if you buy it for 55 or 50 or even 45 (I doubt 45 is reachable). Gain will be huge and fast anyway. From a TA point of view the stock is not oversold i.e. there is some room for a lower numbers. In general the market went up ahead of itself, ahead of economy recovering. Many stocks already overbought i.e. a certain correction is still probable before the next leg up. For the time being I'm day trading SPG with a small profit.

Now known as ""The Great REIT-Opening"". - Canadian REITs have had government support through ""CERS"" paying up to 90% of business' rent and related expenses. Those businesses must pay the landlord their rent as part of receiving government funding. This is one of the BEST programs in the world to keep business' paying rent and keep them alive for the REIT-Opening.- Canadian REITs are the perfect hedge against a weakening US Dollar. Canada is commodity driven, and the loonie has been strengthening against the greenback as commodities rise.- Canadian Real Estate is not saturated like the USA. For retail, 23.5 Sq Feet per capita in the USA. 16.8 Sq Feet per capita in Canada.- Canada land is highly concentrated in major markets. Specifically Vancouver, Toronto(GTA), and Southern Quebec/Montreal. Land is very limited in these areas due to Oceans/Lakes, US Boarder, and Mountains.- Canadian REITs have some of the lowest leverage and extremely high liquidity for their market cap, making them some of the safest REIT-Opening plays and are incredibly undervalued to NAV.- REITs in general have been refinancing at record low rates, and is working as a natural tail wind to earnings.- M&A and Buybacks are going to be the story in 2021 as the record amount of liquidity on these balance sheets are put to work.HR.UN, REI.UN, D.UN, AP.UN, SRU.UN, SOT.UN, MRT.UN, MR.UN remain very beat up to NAV, yet Year over Year revenue and FFO has been minimally impacted. These REITs have serious upside in the REIT-Opening Trade.Americans and Canadians should consider these names in their portfolio for a weakening US Dollar vs CAD Dollar, and as a natural inflation hedge.

2190,"Is retail bottomed? Jared Dillon is the only finance guy I read and he thinks so. Below is his article on the subject.Ding￼I’m sure you’ve heard that malls are getting killed. Pretty soon there will be no malls. Except for those with a Planet Fitness!￼Source: WZZMThere has been lots of ink (and electrons) spilled over the death of retail.Everyone knows it is only a matter of time before Amazon puts every department store, every mall, every brick-and-mortar retailer out of business. Amazon gets an infinity market cap and everyone else gets zero. Sound familiar?That’s the accepted wisdom.Is Amazon a great business? Yes.Is a department store a bad business? Probably.Does Amazon get 100% market share, with department stores getting zero? Probably not.Amazon has over 80 million Prime subscribers in the US. It’s not quite saturated, but it’s getting close.￼I admit to being a Prime member, a late adopter.It is pretty cool. Stuff shows up on my doorstep in two days, for free. The huge poker chip set I just ordered probably weighs about 40 pounds—free shipping! And I get all the Prime movies and TV shows.Sometimes, when I reflect on what a good deal Amazon Prime is, I think that I’m picking Amazon off. But they’re probably picking me off! 80 million customers times $100 is a lot of money.Here is my thesis: Amazon will grow and grow, but there will always be a role for physical retailers. A reduced role, for sure, but there will always be a role.From a capital markets standpoint, now might be the time to put on the trade.The BottomThis is when I started thinking that we've reached a bottom in physical retailers: Last week, ProShares—a $27 billion ETF manager—registered to list some double short leveraged ETFs on brick and mortar retailers! According to Bloomberg, “The ProShares UltraShort Bricks and Mortar Retail fund and ProShares UltraPro Short Bricks and Mortar Retail fund will seek to use derivatives to generate daily returns of two or three times the inverse of an index comprising the most at-risk US retailers…”Ding!In my experience, specialty ETFs like this are usually listed at the worst possible times. Plus, you know my thoughts on leveraged ETFs.When 2x short leveraged ETFs are being listed on physical retailers… it is probably time to buy physical retailers.￼This infographic from AEI is a couple of months old. Since then, Amazon’s market cap has increased to $481 billion. Meanwhile, Macy’s market cap has fallen to a little under $6.5 billion.Amazon is worth around 75 times more than Macy’s? That doesn’t seem right.I hope by this point in the article I have you thinking.I am no Macy’s fan. It is a pretty terrible business, they sell middlebrow stuff in middlebrow locations. Although their online business is actually not bad.I used to buy ties at Macy’s, back in 2001. People laughed at those ties. I no longer buy ties at Macy’s.￼But look—at a $6.5 billion market cap, Macy’s is reaching distressed levels. That means we have to put our distressed investor hat on, pick this business apart, and see if there is value—in all parts of the capital structure. Maybe we don’t like the stock, but maybe we like the bonds, for example. And, Staples was bought by private equity recently for about 0.4 times revenue. Apply that standard to Macy’s and you get to a $10 billion valuation. They’re still kicking.Plus, there’s an argument that this whole Internet retailing thing is just a giant bubble, according to the chart below.￼Source: @bySamRoHow Do You Play It?This is a smart trade, but it is also a dangerous trade unless you are smart.There are two ways to do this:1) Be a distressed investor: Look at the worst-case scenario, look at all parts of the capital structure, and find value.2) Be a quant: Buy a basket of physical retailers, sell a basket of Internet retailers, and wait for them to converge.The worst way to play it is just to naively buy Macy’s (or another retailer) and hope for the best.Furthermore, I think it’s time to go dumpster-diving in Mall REITs, which is what we’re going to do in the next issue of Street Freak.",0.993

I don't live near a Simon Center, but when I look at other COVID-19 beaten down stocks, SPG seems to be a bargain, trading at approx 57% of it's pre-pandemic level. Other COVID-19 affected businesses, like Marriott, Wynn, and Southwest are trading at about 80% of their pre-pandemic levels -- but are currently losing money; even now, SPG turns a profit. While this may dip back down into the 70's after the ex-dividend date, I'm inclined to believe that this time next year, after many are vaccinated, we'll be back in the 120's or higher. This stock may be one of the best bargains on the market for the simple fact that this pandemic shows that lots of folks HATE staying home, and want to go out to restaurants, bars, shopping, Disneyland etc. I don't know anyone that says ""gee, I love staying home, ordering everything from Amazon, and not leaving my house.""",0.9934

Here's the rub....Ikea has a ""International Mall subsidiary"" that puts it into direct competition with current mall owners, not as a tenant, but as a owner and anchor of the malls. Ikea is not a JCPENNY or Macy's that were having problems before the pandemic, but is a destination type store before and after the Pandemic. Just my 2 cents, Ikea malls coming to a neighborhood near you to compete with established, yet newly anchorless malls. btw, not a fan of Ikea, they sell junk furniture and accessories.

For Simon to team up with Brookfield (just for the stores, no distribution centers) was either a desperate act or a strategic one.

Also, big question....144 more stores closing, does that make the buyout smaller?.....Have to remember that's 144 malls.....maybe they're outside of Simon and Brookfield malls, which would then be good for them short term, but long term they're still buying a dying brand that they'll be stuck with forever.......unless they do the Amazon thing....lol....just kidding.....that was all hype and hope and dreams. just some food for thought.....oh, and watch out for GOP Senators.....only 8-12 that would vote for stimulus in $1.8 trillion area......they need 60 total, so at 12 GOP & 47 Dems, you're still only at 59.....may you live in interesting times.",0.949

Please note that we had the guiness of record breaking internet users in Korea for almost decade in the past. And yes of course, we had this conversation about if most of the physical stores are going to close down because of rise of e commerce. Well 15 years later, this is what has happened so far. The malls did not closed down and they were resilient. You go to China and take a look for yourself. The most advanced e commerce country in the world and the malls are thriving. They are not dying. They are thriving. The malls in Korea which have gone down either were manged poorly or were simply in not good location. Yeah in 1990s they were indestructible, but that was not the case anymore. However, the majority of malls thrived. They thrived because of prime location and its real estate price appreciation. Further to note, even e commerce companies started to come into the mall as well which they called ""offline stores."" Once you establish e commerce clothing companies that generate few hundred million revenue, spending 1 million dollar in rent is nothing and in fact you want to do it more for marketing purposes as it increases exposure to the public geatly hence it increasing the brand value. And you see this, Amazon trying to get into the physical location. Not just distributing centre. And I promise you guys. Amazon will eventually build its own physical stores in the malls. Some futures are not hard to see. If you think e commerce is going destroy malls and commercial properties.. You are just solely mistaken... This time is different they say...

So Mall traffic doesn't transcend to Mall purchases, mostly just convenient way to return items. just my observation....best to read retailer reports about mall vs online purchases and confirm for yourself. @Mark talks about long lines at restaurants, well if your establishment is restricted to 25-50% capacity, of course you're going to have long lines. Perhaps Google what Fauci and CDC said about in-store restaurant dining this week. Then go look at #DRI & #BLMN restaurant stock prices for Thursday and Friday. Don't let pumpers take up space in your brain. Research, research, research before investing.....and perhaps go to Malls and ask clerks how business is doing as far as actual sales and get their take on it. They're living it every day....if they say things are great and you don't see empty storefronts, perhaps it is time to buy. $18 BILLION a week has now disappeared via loss of $600 FED unemployment and doesn't look like a deal is in the works to extend it.

I expect this to be in Q2 2020. Hopefully buybacks are announced first and start soon.Liquidity:200M Cash1B Unsecured LOC3.5B Unencumbered Asset PoolBad Debts will be lower due to elimination of CECRA write offs as well as fewer tenant bankruptcies. There are a lot of unknowns. Converting construction developments to a finished product, such as River Landing could materially improve Q4 result estimates regarding FFO & NAV. River Landing is the largest project completing. HR has stated that leasing was ahead of expectations in residential, and retail started to occupy space in November. However, it is likely they have a few months free rent and won't add much to FFO until Q1/Q2 of 2021. The board will likely take this new FFO and use it as additional tailwinds to support a vote on a distribution increase. If not, buying back units would be a good use of funds until the unit price recovers, then increase distributions in Q2 2021. I believe with 2020 write downs behind us, distribution increases are not only warranted, but also needed to ensure the trust pays out enough distributions to avoid any income tax obligations as a REIT. The focus in 2021 should be recovery of the unit pricing. $SPG $MAC $BPY $BXP $ARE $FRT $KIM $ALX $CIO $VNQ $WPC $BAM#D.UN #SRU.UN #SOT.UN #REI.UN #MR.UN",0.9898

However, I'm of the opinion that SPG had made some very worrisome moves lately. I'm not a fan of JCP and believe they are an outdated retailer, with their sum of the parts being greater than the whole. Fail to understand why anchorage of an old fashioned store is such a lure for SPG that is basically a mall reit and lacks the expertise to manage retail skus and inventory control. Further, this direction detracts from their original commitment to buy TCO, which was more in line with their mission and vision. If TCO goes to court, SPG will most likely lose the battle and could be forced to leverage out way too high. OXY is the perfect example to illustrate the consequences of carrying large debt on the BS. Finally I consider it highly unethical on SPG's part to unreasonably fault TCO for inappropriate action during COVID-19. That's a CYA attitude.
