7,"Facebook is, and has always been, a lightning rod for issues outside of its control. Many on this board are viewing the removal of the president's facebook as a violation of the rights granted by the First Amendment and speculate that facebook silences conservative viewpoints that in turn infringes on their rights to freedom of speech. However, this is not a First Amendment issue. Facebook, being a private entity, can censor, remove or suspend any speech that violates their terms and conditions, as agreed to by the user in their ""terms of service"". The first amendment clearly states, ""CONGRESS shall make no law that ... [limits] the freedom of speech"". The government has no power over facebook... nor OAN, nor Fox, nor Newsmax and cannot legally stop the spread of potentially false information. Those individual corporations are proof that the First Amendment is alive and strong. To suggest the removal of the president's accounts from Facebook to Twitter, and all platforms inbetween is somehow a ploy from the left in silencing free speech and the beginning of ""socialism"" or ""communism"" is pure folly as evidenced by the fact that some media outlets have exercised their freedom of speech and insinuated as such. Sorry for the rant. Just exercising my First Amendment right ;). P.S. Long facebook because of their balance sheet and market opportunities in AI.",0.9769

All bets are off come Monday which is when I expect the pps to finally start showing some appreciation for the blowout Q3 earnings. Also, don't forget, Q4 is historically FB's best quarter for revenue. I read that mobile is accounting for 70% of ad dollars. Yep, all those ad dollars that were once the exclusive purview of radio, TV, mags and newspapers have found their way into FB's coffers. To wit, have you noticed how ""thin"" your daily local newspaper has gotten? Do you ever remember TV showing so many ads for gold, silver, lawyers and other non-traditional topics? Of course not, and it's because their ad rates have dropped so much the aforesaid group can now afford them.

34,"Stock splits are historically implemented by companies that want to improve the marketability of their shares, which can potentially enhance shareholder value resulting from an increase in demand for the shares. Apple, which went public in 1980, has split its shares FIVE times since then; Google has split its shares TWICE since its shares went public in 2004. These moves by both companies have proven to be extremely financially beneficial to shareholders. Facebook, in contrast, has refused to offer a share split because that action would not be advantageous to Mark Zuckerberg, even though shareholders could greatly benefit from a split. The share split should have happened a while ago but it seems highly unlikely to happen, as shareholder interests are secondary to the company’s management team. To better promote the interests of shareholders, I am asking other shareholders to join me in demanding the resignations of Zuckerberg and Sandberg. A management team change is long overdue, and it’s critical we push for the installation of a new team to better represent shareholder interests. Zuckerberg and Sandberg MUST GO!",0.9922

The measure is expected to generate as much as $250 million in its first year.The Maryland tax specifically applies to digital ads that are displayed within the state. It's also levied based on the ad sales that a company generates. Companies that make at least $100 million to $1 billion a year will be taxed at a 2.5% rate. Companies that make more than $15 billion — which includes Facebook and google — will face a 10% tax on digital ad revenue.Legislators in Connecticut and Indiana have already introduced similar measures to tax social media giants.The tax legislation is just part of a growing debate about the dominance and power of technology giants. In the U.S., companies like Facebook and Google are facing multiple antitrust lawsuits. Antitrust legislation introduced at the federal level could target those companies.

That agreement also protected Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg.Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of the Court of Chancery cited the paper by Gibson Dunn attorneys in his ruling directing Facebook to turn over documents to shareholders who are trying to determine if Facebook overpaid to protect Zuckerberg.""The documents already produced provide no insight into why Facebook would pay more than its (apparently) maximum exposure to settle a claim,"" said Slights in the ruling. Shareholders, he said, were ""right to question whether internal communications among Facebook fiduciaries might shed light on the Board’s thinking in this regard.""Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The July 2019 deal resolved allegations Facebook mishandled user privacy. The company did not admit wrongdoing.Slights said Facebook faced a maximum penalty of about $104 million, according to the Gibson Dunn paper.The FTC did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.Joel Fleming, an attorney for the Facebook shareholders, told Slights during a hearing last year that before they sue over the FTC settlement they wanted to know: ""Did anyone say, 'Go ask the FTC, would you take less money if Mr. Zuckerberg is personally liable'?""Slights refused to order the company to turn over documents that Facebook said were protected by attorney-client privilege, in part because the judge said shareholders could gain insights from non-privileged electronic communications he was ordering to be disclosed.",0.9944

440,"After looking into detail policy changes, just want to share this with you all:Short version: your personal conversations remain personal and encrypted. WhatsApp’s data sharing hasn’t really changed, its security hasn’t changed, it remains the largest end-to-end encrypted platform available.Long version:Keeping aside any jokes on what valuable or secret data you are really trying to protect...1. WhatsApp is still end to end encrypted, which means that ALL your chat threads (group or 1:1) as well as your voice/video calls are entirely secure and only available to you and the people you are talking to. Yes, that includes all your naughty content too.2. Your contact list on the phone that you use for looking up contacts and sending messages to/calling people, is not shared with anyone, including Facebook.3. The only time you have to worry about your data “leaking” is when you backup your WhatsApp messages to iCloud (if you are on iPhone) or equivalent Android backup service. To be able to restore that data on a new device, the backup file is not encrypted. So please protect your iCloud backups well.4. So what are the real changes? *In future* IF and WHEN you start using WhatsApp to send messages to businesses or do payment transactions, the shopping data can be shared with merchants and Facebook to improve their services (example making your Ads more personalized for you). When in future will this happen? Your guess is as good as mine...5. If nothing really has changed, why all this noise? Or a more candid version of this - why can’t WhatsApp explain this in simple language? WhatsApp over-communicates and proactively shares even the slightest change that might impact its extremely high standards on privacy to run an end to end encrypted private messaging service for 2 Billion people. Good learning for us that technically nuanced and accurate messaging doesn’t work at 2B people scale.6. Can you give feedback to the WhatsApp team about this? Absolutely. See a more detailed response from the head of WhatsApp: https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1347660768225841152…7. Do I need to pay for a private/secure version of WhatsApp? Heck no. Please don’t fall for any such scams. There is only one secure, private version of WhatsApp and that is FREE for all the 2 billion people who use it. And yes, feel free to forward this to your friends and family.",0.9977

The FTC voted 3-2 along party lines to adopt the settlement, which requires court approval, even as Democrats said the settlement did not go far enough or require a large enough fine.“Despite repeated promises to its billions of users worldwide that they could control how personal information is shared Facebook undermined consumers’ choices,” said FTC Chairman Joe Simons, a Republican, in a statement.But Democratic FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra said the penalty provided “blanket immunity” for Facebook executives “and no real restraints on Facebook’s business model” and does “not fix the core problems that led to these violations.”Facebook declined to comment ahead of the settlement’s public release.The FTC said that Facebook’s data policy was deceptive to “tens of millions” of people who used Facebook’s facial recognition tool and also violated its rules against deceptive practices when it did not disclose phone numbers collected to enable a security feature would be used for advertising.Under the settlement, Facebook’s board will create an independent privacy committee that removes “unfettered control by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over decisions affecting user privacy.”Facebook also agreed to exercise greater oversight over third-party apps. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-ftc/facebook-to-pay-record-5-billion-u-s-fine-over-privacy-violations-but-critics-call-it-a-bargain-idUSKCN1UJ1L9",0.9502

558,"While I'm new to this board, I figured I would share my thoughts on $SNAP at ~$57/share and why I see a tear to $100. Used to be a bear, even held a short, but am now heavily exposed on the long side for a few reason. Firstly, $SNAP has great demographic exposure: the young audience. A case can be made (Big E) that TikTok is stealing users away from $SNAP. But it's just not true. In 4Q, $SNAP added a record number of sequential DAUs, and was able to monetize them at scale. In addition, we saw ~58% gross margins in 4Q (and that factors in an acceptable 500bps headwind from Spotlight) as $SNAP builds out their TikTok competitor in Spotlight. At this point, $SNAP has raw ARPU inertia going for it. In 2020, $FB monetized their global user base at ~$45/DAU. SNAP is at ~$10. So, you've got a 4.5x revenue growth opportunity from improved monetization alone, not even factoring in user growth, which has been accelerating (in terms of sequential adds). Now, the company is guiding for multiple years of ~50%+ rev. growth based solely on monetization expansion, implying that the 50% number could be conservative. This puts it among the top tier growth companies in tech, meaning a premium valuation is warranted.",0.9876

Their reasons for taking away things from conservatives are #$%$ Nobody on Parler was planning events or riots or anything.

This means they can borrow billions if they want to, at very low interest rates. Right now FB should be trading in the $340-$370 range all things considered. I believe FB should announce a huge buyback and this would propel the stock to the $400 ballpark. Would a $100B loan only cost them ~$1B/year in interest. I think this confidence would create far more than $100B in shareholder value. It seemed to work for Advance Auto.

The notification, seen by Reuters, said without detail that the group violated policies on ""adult sexual exploitation.""""We were first on the picking tree to be cut off because we are on Facebook, not a free platform like Reddit,"" said Tran, referring to the typically lighter moderation on the discussion website.Some of his group's members made tens of thousands of dollars in recent trades first popularized on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, he said.Tran, who also runs the 20,000-member HaiKhuu Trading group on chat app Discord, said he has never seen adult content on the Facebook group.Facebook spokeswoman Kristen Morea said, ""This group was removed for violating our Community Standards, unrelated to the ongoing stock frenzy."" She did not respond to requests to elaborate.Tran said institutional investors are trying to separate retail traders.Facebook suspended his group on Jan. 7 after labeling it a ""dangerous organization,"" according to correspondence seen by Reuters, though the company reinstated its privileges after he appealed to contacts there.""With all these major institutions being frustrated with the success of retail, they are trying to target any groups they can,"" said Tran, who was featured in a Wall Street Journal article in November and described his Facebook group as the largest of its kind.Tran expressed concern that a replacement group he formed to carry on discussions also will be taken down.",0.9875

1088,"Microsoft wades into Facebook news fight by siding with European publishersLondon (CNN Business)Microsoft is joining forces with publishers in Europe to call for an Australia-style system that would force tech platforms such as Google and Facebook to pay news organizations for content.The company said Monday that it would team up with media industry groups like the European Publishers Council to lobby for such a policy, which lawmakers around the world are now considering.The move comes after Facebook (FB) stopped people from finding news on its platform in Australia last week rather than pay publishers for their content, a decision that produced a global backlash and generated negative headlines for the social media company.""We welcome Microsoft's recognition of the value that our content brings to the core businesses of search engines and social networks,"" Christian Van Thillo, the European Publishers Council's chairman, said in a statement.Australia's government is pushing legislation that would allow certain media outlets to bargain with tech companies so they could be paid for distribution of the news they produce. Both parties would enter arbitration if they can't reach an agreement.The European Union and the United States face growing pressure to adopt similar measures. Canada's government has said it plans to introduce legislation in the coming months.Facebook has forcefully opposed the Australian legislation. Last week, it took the extraordinary step of banning users in the country from finding or sharing news on its service in protest of the policy. Google, meanwhile, went from threatening to pull its search engine to cutting deals with some of the country's largest media organizations, including Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.Microsoft (MSFT), which owns the search engine Bing, is taking a different approach. It voiced its support for the legislation and has committed to keeping its services in Australia if it takes effect, seeing a chance to steal market share from rival Google (GOOGL).""It was an opportunity to combine good business with a good cause,"" President Brad Smith said in a blog post earlier this month.The company has said it would back similar measures in other countries, including in the European Union, where policymakers are debating new laws that would rein in the power of Big Tech companies.Margrethe Vestager, the EU commissioner leading the charge on tech regulation, is holding a consultation on the legislation with members of European Parliament this week.New copyright laws in Europe require search engines and social media platforms to share revenue with publishers if their content is displayed. But European publishers and Microsoft want leaders to enact ""additional regulatory measures"" to ensure publishers have clout in negotiations.Some French publishers have signed up with Google, but without an arbitration mechanism, they fear the press ""might not have the economic strength to negotiate fair and balanced agreements with these gatekeeper tech companies, who might otherwise threaten to walk away from negotiations or exit markets entirely,"" according to Monday's press release.""Access to fresh, broad and deep press coverage is critical to the success of our democracies,"" Microsoft vice president Casper Klynge said in a statement.",0.9873

Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., unveiled a sweeping antitrust reform bill on Thursday. • The bill sets a tough tone to start her new role as chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. • If enacted, the proposals could draw even more risk and scrutiny to large firms including Facebook and Google.Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., unveiled a sweeping antitrust reform bill on Thursday, setting a tough tone in her new role as chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.Klobuchar has been a frequent critic of what she and other lawmakers have viewed as lax enforcement of existing antitrust laws and has called for strong measures against some of the major tech firms. While she’s introduced several bills in the past seeking reforms to various aspects of antitrust law, the “Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act” is a comprehensive proposal calling for a major revamp of enforcement standards. If enacted, it would bring significantly more risk to companies like Facebook and Google, which are already facing federal lawsuits, and to any dominant firm seeking to acquire another company.With this bill, Klobuchar is drawing her line in the sand on antitrust reform, signaling that she will use her post to call for major changes to the status quo. Broadly, the bill seeks to reform antitrust law in three main ways: 1) resetting the standard for enforcement and shifting the burden of proof onto dominant firms in merger cases; 2) requiring agencies to study markets and merger effects regularly, with the help of additional funds; and 3) giving new tools to antitrust enforcers, like imposing civil penalties.In the House, antitrust subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., has similarly called for extensive reforms throughout an investigation into Facebook and Google. That investigation culminated last year in a nearly 450-page report on the companies’ alleged monopoly power and suggested reforms to restore competition to the digital market.",-0.5875

This also works in reverse – a Facebook ID can be used to harvest a users’ phone number.While the initial results from the bot are hidden, users can pay to reveal the full phone number. It costs $20 per phone number unlocked, with prices reaching $5,000 for 10,000 numbers.""It is very worrying to see a database of that size being sold in cybercrime communities, it harms our privacy severely and will certainly be used for smishing and other fraudulent activities by bad actors,"" said Alon Gal, co-founder and CTO of cybersecurity firm Hudson Rock, who alerted Motherboard to the breach.Gal obtained a sample of the bot’s data, which Motherboard then shared with Facebook.“It is important that Facebook notify its users of this breach so they are less likely to fall victim to different hacking and social engineering attempts,"" Gal told Motherboard.",0.9851

1330,"In order to understand why $SNAP is trading where it's trading (valuation wise), we have to understand the story and the long-term picture. Here it is (from a bullish perspective: $SNAP delivers comparable ad ROI returns to that of $FB and gets similar ARPU grab to $FB (~$45-$50/DAU annually). Keep in mind, $SNAP will likely drive far more advertiser value than $TWTR long-term while $TWTR is already monetizing at $16-$17/DAU annually.In addition, $SNAP continues to expand its international use as the rebuilt Android design draw in the international crowd. Keep in mind that $SNAP is still early-innings in many of these international markets, so there is a lot of room for expansion. So, let's value $SNAP. What's it really worth. Well, to understand that, let's try to think about where the business will be in a decade. Here are the numbers behind the narrative:- ARPU of $45- DAUs of 500mln- Revenue of $22.5bln- 87% gross margins ($6 of CoRPU, mostly infrastructure/revenue share, and content creation costs)- ~$6 billion in OpEx (vs. ~$2.2B in 2020)On the current share count of ~1.5B shares, 2030 $SNAP is doing ~$9/share in EPS. Assuming a 4% earnings yield (basically 25x earnings) for a high margin, high growth tech business, which is roughly in line with present-day $FB, then $SNAP can be worth ~$225/share in 2030. Discounting back at ~7%/year (low rate environment, moderating equity beta, low ERP) I'm at a 2022 year end PT of ~$125/share.",0.9899

1497,"‘We will not be intimidated’: PM takes Facebook fight to India and the worldGlobal leaders will be asked to back Australia in a fight with Facebook over its market power after the social media giant silenced news, health and emergency services in a bid to halt a federal law.Prime Minister Scott Morrison raised the shock tactic with Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on Thursday night in the first step of a plan to mobilise global support to stop Facebook “bullying” elected governments.“We will not be intimidated by this act of bullying by BigTech, seeking to pressure parliament as it votes on our important News Media Bargaining Code.“I am in regular contact with the leaders of other nations on these issues. We simply won’t be intimidated, just as we weren’t when Amazon threatened to leave the country and when Australia drew other nations together to combat the publishing of terrorist content on social media platforms.”Facebook’s actions to unfriend Australia today, cutting off essential information services on health and emergency services, were as arrogant as they were disappointing,” Mr Morrison said in his post.”These actions will only confirm the concerns that an increasing number of countries are expressing about the behaviour of Social media companies who think they are bigger than governments and that the rules should not apply to them.“Mr Morrison took plans to regulate social media to a G20 summit in Japan and a G7 meeting in France in 2019, when the Christchurch attack in March that year sparked calls to stop the spread of violent terror content.One option for the Prime Minister is to discuss Facebook and digital content regulation again this year when he attends the G7 summit hosted by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Cornwall in June with leaders from Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.The proposed law, which mandates a bargaining code to force Google and Facebook to pay media companies for using their content, is being watched by these countries and the European Union as a precedent in regulating social media.Labor voted to support the bill in the House of Representatives on Wednesday night, clearing the way for it to pass the Senate and become law as early as next week.Labor leader Anthony Albanese said Facebook’s actions were “reprehensible” but the government had a responsibility to tell Australians what the next steps would be.Mr Morrison’s talks with Mr Modi, conducted by phone on Thursday afternoon, raised concerns about Facebook and its power when the company is seeking help from the Indian government in a huge market.“Decisions that are made here shape the global discussion,” Mr Zuckerberg told Indian business executives in December in a pitch to expand the company’s Whatsapp business app, which has 30 per cent of its global users in India.Australian Human Rights Commissioner Edward Santow rebuked Facebook for depriving users of public information including health and emergency updates.“Freedom of expression includes the right to speak and to receive information,” Mr Santow wrote.",-0.4667

1601,"Facebook profit is deadlyThe antitrust action filed by 48 states and territories against Facebook gives us hope that tech firms will one day be held responsible for the harms they have caused our society. But we’re left wondering: Why are state prosecutors focused only on Facebook’s monopolistic behavior? What about the firm’s facilitation of serious crime and extremism?The Alliance to Counter Crime Online, which we run, tracks how tech platforms enable a wide range of illicit actors to reach vast audiences to market their goods, negotiate prices, raise money and accept payment. Facebook profits off this illegal activity from the ads for commercial products that appear in the feeds of users who come online in search of illegal ones. This symbiotic relationship benefits Facebook and criminals, but its impact on ordinary people can be deadly.Our researchers and others have tracked how Facebook’s family of platforms have overtaken the dark web as the premier online source for the illegal drugs driving these overdoses.To get a sense of the scale of the narcotics market thriving across Facebook platforms, consider this: Facebook’s latest Transparency Report claims the company found and took action on more than 5.9 million drug sales posts from Facebook and Instagram in the third quarter of 2020. The report also claims that AI flagged 94 percent of these drug sales posts before any users reported them (although this doesn’t account for how many times these posts were viewed). Facebook’s 94 percent “success rate,” however, means that at least 354,000 confirmed drug sales were reported by users after evading Facebook’s AI systems. By comparison, when the Justice Department shut down AlphaBay in 2017, the world’s largest dark web marketplace had about 250,000 listings for illegal drugs and toxic chemicals. And when the Justice Department seized the Silk Road servers in 2013, that dark web marketplace featured a mere 13,000 drug postings.And these numbers assume Facebook is being honest. Our research, collaborated by recent whistleblower accounts, suggests the firm exaggerates the success of their content removal efforts, so the number of drug posts could be even larger.The problem is that Facebook’s recommendation algorithms are far more efficient at spreading drug content than its moderation tools are at sniffing it out. Predictive search on Instagram, the number one online drug marketplace, suggests alternate spellings to make sure anyone showing the faintest interest in drugs can find them—even if that interest is negative. Search for #opioidaddiction, #twelvesteps or another recovery-related topic on Instagram and you will be served multiple posts with drugs for sale (even as a spokesperson touts the platform as a place where people struggling with addiction can get help).Our researchers run daily test searches, and we consistently find that the average Instagram user — i.e. someone between the ages of 13 and 29 — is less than 10 seconds and a few clicks away from being able to buy narcotics or counterfeit pills.It’s enough to make you feel anxious. Mention that sensation while chatting on Facebook platforms and you will begin to see advertisements for online pharmacies selling prescription medicines at cut-rate prices, some of which are lethal counterfeit drugs. The pandemic gave the online pharmacy market a shot in the arm, with 31 percent of Americans buying prescriptions online for the first time.According to the FDA, 97 percent of online pharmacies are fake, and illegal online pharmacies have emerged as the main source of the counterfeit medications causing the current spike in overdoses. Facebook actually sells these illegal pharmacies ad space, yet another way the firm profits off illegal activity.On Jan. 6, members of Congress experienced firsthand how illegal activity taking place on Facebook can have deadly, real-life consequences. Facebook knows its algorithms spread division, and that many of its most popular groups are cesspits of illicit activity and extremism, but this active facilitation of crime and extremism has never been properly addressed by our judicial system.Just as state attorneys general have begun to unravel how powerful tech algorithms stifle competition, it is vital to also grasp how Facebook algorithms spread and amplify serious crime, and the myriad ways the firm profits from victimizing ordinary people.The world’s biggest social media company isn’t just harming society with its monopolistic behavior. Facebook platforms are a threat to the health and human safety of the American people. It is time to hold the firm and its senior executives accountable.",0.9967

""I think it is only fair that they pay back a fair amount.""The EU has been at the forefront of tough new data and tech regulation in recent years, bringing in the wide-ranging GDPR data protection legislation - which has resulted in massive fines for the likes of British Airways and Marriott Hotels - and proposals to clamp down on digital giants.",0.8486

Facebook had previously argued that the CMA imposed unreasonable and disproportionate restrictions on the company.The CMA is increasingly voicing concerns about internet giants swallowing up smaller firms. Its Chief Executive Officer, Andrea Coscelli, said in October that the largest tech companies should face scrutiny for any transaction, no matter how tiny.Facebook had to pause its integration with Giphy in June after the CMA said it wanted to investigate whether the deal would give the social network too much information on its rivals’ operations.",-0.6473

Ed Markey (D-MA) wrote a scathing letter to Mark Zuckerberg condemning Facebook's method of recommending political groups to users on its platform. A representative of Markey's office shared the letter with Insider.The Massachusetts senator said Facebook not only allows users to ""organize and coordinate violent and anti-democratic efforts on these pages,"" but that it recommends them to people.""Facebook's system of recommending political groups poses grave threats to American democracy and public safety,"" Markey wrote in the letter. ""Many Facebook groups (pages on your platform that function as forums for users to communicate about a particular topic) are breeding grounds for hate, echo-chambers of misinformation, and venues for coordination of violence, including explicit planning for the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.""Markey said Facebook ""failed to meet commitments it made"" to stop the practice, commitments that Markey said were also made in Zuckerberg's responses during a hearing before the US Senate in October.During the hearing, Zuckerberg said the company has taken ""the step of stopping recommendations in groups for all political content or social issue groups as a precaution for this."" In early January, Facebook reiterated that it still does not recommend political groups for people to join. But according to Markey, Facebook is not keeping to its word.The senator referenced an investigation by The Markup that found 12 of the top 100 groups recommending on Facebook were political, including groups that promoted violence.Markey is demanding that Facebook address this discrepancy and provide an explanation by February 9.",-0.9748

1852,"Facebook, Instagram and YouTube become the platforms for drug dealers Accounts peddling steroids, opioids and other drugs remain easy to find on major social networks. A new report published today by the Digital Citizens Alliance, a consumer watchdog group, and Coalition for a Safer Web details how Facebook pages, Instagram accounts and YouTube videos are promoting drug sales, in some instances to thousands of followers or viewers. The Digital Citizens Alliance, researchers and other advocacy groups have warned the tech companies of such sales for several years, and they say the persistent appearance of such posts raises questions about social media companies fostering apparent criminal activity. “If we can find it, they can find it. That begs the question how hard they're looking,” Digital Citizens Alliance Executive Director Tom Galvin said in an interview. The researchers also uncovered that similar accounts were peddling what they claimed to be coronavirus vaccines or testing kits. Law enforcement has said it would be fraudulent for individuals to sell vaccines, which are being distributed in authorized medical centers – and the report's authors raised concerns that potentially fake vaccines or test kits could give people a false sense of security about their protection from the virus. Facebook, Twitter, Google and others have been particularly aggressive in promising to stamp out content taking advantage of the public health crisis, and the findings raise questions about the enforcement of these policies.“The platforms continue to treat this as a PR problem instead of an Internet safety issue,” Galvin said. “When we put out things, they take them down and say all is fixed. But it's whack-a-mole, and they're up again the next week.”",0.9611

Policymakers and the public are in the dark about what social media and video streaming services do to capture and sell users’ data and attention. It is alarming that we still know so little about companies that know so much about us.”Specifically, the agency said it wants information related to how social media and video streaming services collect, use, track, estimate, or derive personal and demographic information, and how the companies determine which ads and content consumers see. The FTC wants to know whether the companies apply algorithms or data analytics to personal information, and the impact of such efforts.The FTC asked the social media and video streaming services to illustrate, in detail, how they utilize demographic information collected on age, country, and whether a user is of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin. The FTC asked them to share the inputs and methodology for assessing their services’ reach, as well as to identify the top 1,000 most populous attributes that make a user valuable to their platform.",0.9859

While almost always time-limited, artists exclusives are often a differentiating factor that music-streaming services compete over, so releasing content as an exclusive on a photo/video-sharing service is quite the departure -- and a new model worth exploring.Keep in mind that Facebook recently inked deals with all three major record labels -- Warner Music, Sony/ATV Music Publishing, and Universal Music -- that give it the rights to include copyrighted music in user-generated content. All of those deals notably included Instagram. It seems unlikely that Facebook or Instagram would try to launch a pure music-streaming service anytime soon, but it undoubtedly has an opportunity to encroach on YouTube's dominance as a popular destination for music videos and other free music content.Incredibly, Instagram's user base is catching up with YouTube. The Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) property was originally launched in 2005 and now has roughly 1.8 billion monthly active users (MAUs).

1951,"‘Arrogant’ and ‘wrong’: Australia slams Facebook’s move to block news as unnecessary and heavy-handed • The social media giant on Wednesday said it will no longer allow publishers and users in Australia to share or view news on its platform. • Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Facebook’s actions were “as arrogant as they were disappointing.” • “Facebook was wrong. Facebook’s actions were unnecessary. They were heavy handed and they will damage its reputation here in Australia,” said Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said at a media briefing on Thursday.The Australian government has slammed Facebook’s decision to block users in the country from all news content on its platform — a move that ended up affecting access to several government sites.Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison called Facebook’s move “arrogant” and “disappointing,” while Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said it was “wrong” and “unnecessary.”The social media company on Wednesday announced its decision to ban Australian users from viewing and sharing news content. It came ahead of an expected decision by the Australian parliament to pass a new media bill that will require online platforms like Google and Facebook to pay news outlets for displaying and linking to their content.“Facebook was wrong. Facebook’s actions were unnecessary. They were heavy-handed and they will damage its reputation here in Australia,” Frydenberg said at a media briefing on Thursday.“Their decision to block Australians’ access to government sites — be they about support through the pandemic, mental health, emergency services, the Bureau of Meteorology — were completely unrelated to the media code, which is yet to pass through the Senate,” he said.Frydenberg’s comments were later followed by strong criticism from Morrison.“Facebook’s actions to unfriend Australia today, cutting off essential information services on health and emergency services, were as arrogant as they were disappointing,” Morrison said in a Facebook post.In addition to pages run by news outlets, several government-backed Australian accounts were also wiped clean by Facebook on Thursday morning. Government pages affected include those providing updates on the Covid pandemic and bushfire threats.Facebook’s decision was in contrast to that of Google. The latter on Wednesday said it has agreed on a revenue-sharing deal with Australian media conglomerate News Corp, which owns media outlets including The Wall Street Journal and New York Post.“We will not be intimidated by BigTech seeking to pressure our Parliament as it votes on our important News Media Bargaining Code,” said the prime minister.Human rights advocates also criticized Facebook’s move. Elaine Pearson, Australia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement posted on Twitter that the social media giant is restricting important information such as Covid-19 updates.“Facebook is severely restricting the flow of information to Australians,” she said.“This is an alarming and dangerous turn of events. Cutting off access to vital information to an entire country in the dead of the night is unconscionable,” she added.Facebook’s “overreach” earlier Thursday that restricted Australians’ access to non-news pages was a “bad” public relations move, said Tama Leaver, a professor at Curtin University’s School of Media, Creative Arts and Social Inquiry.“I think Facebook has lost the PR battle by enforcing a ban that’s just simply too wide,” Leaver told CNBC’s “Street Signs Asia” on Thursday.“If Facebook was hoping this would remind Australians how important Facebook is, I think really they’re gonna remind that Facebook does things without considering the consequences on its users,” he added.",0.598

1996,"Facebook to close Irish holding companies at centre of tax disputeIntellectual property to be repatriated to the US after IRS said it was owed $9bn in taxesFacebook is winding up Irish holding companies it has used to channel billions of profits to avoid paying taxes in the US, the UK and hundreds of other countries.The company’s main Irish subsidiary paid $101m (£75m) in tax while recording profits of more than $15bn in 2018, the last year for which records are available. Facebook companies around the world paid the Irish holding company for use of its intellectual property.Facebook International Holdings I Unlimited Company recorded revenue of $30bn in 2018, more than half of Facebook’s total global turnover of $56bn.The company’s decision to close the Irish divisions and return its intellectual property to the US came shortly after the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) took the company to court claiming it owed more than $9bn linked to its 2010 decision to shift its profits to Ireland. Before its stock market flotation in 2012, Facebook valued its intangible assets at $6.5bn in 2010, but the IRS claimed the true value was $21bn.The decision to wind up three of Facebook’s Irish holding companies was recorded by the Irish Companies Registration Office.Facebook paid just £28.6m in tax in the UK last year, even though it recorded £2.2bn in gross revenue from advertisers, according to accounts filed this month at Companies House. The tax payment was up only £100,000 on the previous year despite profits rising by more than a quarter.Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP and chair of the parliamentary group on responsible taxation, said the tiny tax payment “beggars belief”.“While other companies have struggled during the pandemic, big tech has thrived as people spend more and more time online,” she said. “Facebook and the rest of the tech giants must do their moral duty and pay their fair share.”Google moved its intellectual property holdings from Ireland back to the US in January, before the closing of the “double Irish” tax loophole, which has been used by US companies to channel international profits through Ireland and on to tax havens like Bermuda, keeping them outside the US. Ireland agreed to close the scheme under international pressure five years ago but companies were given until the end of 2020 to comply.",0.9966

2058,"Hello all. I figured I would lay out why I'm a long-term bull on $PINS and why it is one of my favorite names within the social media advertising universe. First of all let's understand the value propositions for $PINS from both an advertiser and a user perspective: Starting with the users. Users love $PINS because it's simply a different type of platform. This isn't a platform where the most engagement (likes, comments, etc.) wins (like $TWTR or $FB). It's an inspiration engine of sorts. If you want to get ideas for a vacation, or how to redecorate your house you use $PINS. $PINS is like an inspiration search engine. The more you show $PINS about what you enjoy on the platform, the more they can curate specific content to you. The social aspect is the exchanging of inspiration. This leaves users with a sweet taste in their mouth after using the platform, whereas $FB and $TWTR users tend to be more bitter after using the app (think of the crazy political discourse on those apps). The stats back it up: 47% of $PINS users have an intent to purchase vs. mid to high teens on other platforms. This isn't a social media platform, it's social commerce.For advertisers: Users have high purchase intent, there is a lot of first party data that $PINS has on platform to better target and curate ads, and it doesn't have the PR backlash of advertising on $TWTR or $FB. Sure, you might not get the third party targeting, and the automated ad platform is still in the early innings, but the long-term value proposition for advertisers is there: 459 million people are looking for inspiration. Give it to them.",0.9916

Zuckerberg and Sandberg, the management duopoly effectively running this entire company, have attempted to burnish the reputation of the company through an aggressive PR campaign for the past several years, but the campaign has not worked. Facebook has lost an enormous amount of market respect, and, most importantly, Zuckerberg and Sandberg are reviled in the market and lack favorable public sentiment. The only way to restore the reputation of this company and to reconfirm its place as a true growth company is to install a new management team; fresh leadership sends a message to the market that the players responsible for the data privacy scandal have been held accountable. More importantly, a new management team to lead this company into the future tells the market it’s not afraid to change and it’s serious about growth.

In addition to overseeing drug trafficking and extortion rings, La Local was reportedly behind over 90 percent of the city’s homicides. Optra had successfully evaded the police for months, but he left digital breadcrumbs in the form of his meticulously curated Instagram profile. There, his many fans were regaled regularly with photos of Optra donning diamond-encrusted bracelets, designer clothes, and an arsenal of firearms. According to police officials, his lively social media profile was key to his arrest and conviction.Optra is not the first crime boss to display his gangster lifestyle on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or Instagram. Nor is he the first to get caught after doing so. Drug traffickers and gangs are lively social media users across the Americas. Cartel bosses and their underlings use mainstream social media and popular messaging apps such as WhatsApp to shore up power and influence, threaten the competition, recruit new members, conduct sex trafficking, sell drugs and contraband. Mexico used to be ground zero for this kind of activity, where researchers created a new discipline out of studying these narco posts. Now, gangs in Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, and the United States are also involved.Law enforcement agencies have been warning for years that the so-called darknet—the unmonitored reaches of the internet—is one of the largest sources of direct sales of illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services. Transnational law enforcement operations involving simultaneous takedowns of darknet vendors are routine. Yet hiding in plain sight is the sale of illicit goods on public social media. Instagram is currently the leading platform for selling drugs directly to consumers, while Facebook comes a close second. These platforms serve as a kind of halfway point between the street market and the darknet.",0.9714

2298,"Facebook doesn't seem to mind that facial recognition glasses would endanger womenPicture this: you’re sitting in a bar and a creepy stranger keeps trying to talk to you. You ignore them. The next day you get a text from that stranger. Not only do they know your phone number, they know where you live; in fact, they know everything about you. They were wearing Facebook smart glasses, you see. The moment they looked in your direction the glasses identified you via facial recognition technology.This, it seems, is precisely the sort of Black Mirror-esque future Facebook wants. The tech company (and serial privacy invader) has teamed up with Ray-Ban to develop a range of smart glasses. While it’s not clear exactly what these devices will do yet, Buzzfeed has reported that Facebook is considering building facial recognition capabilities into them. During an internal meeting on Thursday, Andrew Bosworth, Facebook’s vice-president of augmented and virtual reality, told employees that Facebook was currently assessing the legal issues surrounding this.Legal issues are one thing, but what about the very obvious ethical and privacy issues? Would you be able to mark your face as “unsearchable?”, one employee asked. And what about the potential for “real-world harm” and “stalkers”?Bosworth replied: “Face recognition … might be the thorniest issue, where the benefits are so clear, and the risks are so clear, and we don’t know where to balance those things.”Excuse me? What kind of benefits could possibly balance the risk of making life extremely easy for stalkers and creeps? Well, Bosworth later said on Twitter, it could help people with prosopagnosia, a neurological condition where you can’t recognize people’s faces. More generally, Bosworth said, it would be super handy when you run into someone at a party and can’t remember their name. Ah yes, I can totally see how avoiding a little social awkwardness balances out the whole stalker thing!No need to worry too much about privacy, though. We all know you can trust Facebook to do the right thing and keep your data nice and safe. When a (female) Wired editor raised the concern that you could no longer pacify creeps at parties by giving them a fake name and number, for example, Bosworth breezily replied that there’d be a technological fix for that. The exchange makes it almost hilariously clear that Bosworth had given very little thought to the implications of this kind of tech on women’s everyday lives. Which is to be expected, considering Facebook started life as a website that let people rank hot girls via photos obtained without their consent.Facebook, of course, may not end up building facial recognition into its glasses. However, the fact it is even considering doing so is a disturbing reminder of how little ownership we currently have over our own faces. Several photos of your face, for example, are probably in Clearview AI’s database. The company, which counts the Facebook board member Peter Thiel as an investor, built a secretive facial recognition tool which it trained, in part, on pictures it scraped from social media. It sells its services to law enforcement agencies but also gives access to its app – which lets you hold your phone up to someone’s face and pull up their personal information – to select people. John Catsimatidis, the billionaire owner of Gristedes grocery, boasted about using the Clearview App to identify a man he saw on a date with his daughter, for example.As well as being intrusive, facial recognition technology is plagued with problems. It doesn’t work as well on people with darker skin, for one thing. At least three black men have been falsely arrested based on a bad facial recognition match. But as long as the collateral damage involved with this tech is just black people and women, who cares, eh? None of the big technology companies seem to. Timnit Gebru is one of the leading voices in AI ethics and has done groundbreaking work around bias in facial recognition technology. Gebru was fired from her role as technical co-lead of Google’s ethical AI team in December; she alleges they were trying to suppress her research on bias. Last week Google also fired Margaret Mitchell, another top AI ethics researcher. Big tech loves to wax lyrical about their commitment to privacy and ethics but their actions tell a very different story.",0.999

So,we're all behind Australia in my view.""Asked if Facebook and other tech giants had got too big fortheir boots, Knight said: ""That's the understatement of the century isn't it?""""The way in which you tackle the tech giants in a positiveway is to look at competition,"" he said.",0.9864

Eventually, once ""everyone knows"" about a pattern in the stock market, that's about when it stops working.Maybe it'll sell off again this time, but I suspect ""this time will be different."" FB rallied the last few days, but overall it has lagged the other FANG stocks for the last few months. It hasn't made significant new highs. In fact, FB actually first hit 188.00 in AH trading on 11/1/2017, before Zuck killed the rally. There is some negative sentiment and I think earnings expectations are WAY too low. I think this quarter, 4Q2017 will go down in history as one of the biggest blowouts of all time. I think $200-210 is a conservative view on the post earnings move. I wouldn't be surprised to see $220-230 within a few weeks after results come out.

Facebook ad revenue should accelerate further than its third-quarter 22% year-over-year growth led by ongoing recovery and a heavy e-commerce holiday season, JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note last week. Those analysts project fourth-quarter ad revenue growth of 26% year over year. Oppenheimer analysts said they anticipate fourth-quarter advertising revenue will “handily” top Wall Street estimates at 30% year over year versus estimates of 25%. They added that according to Gupta Media, fourth-quarter global CPMs at Facebook and Instagram were up 35% year over year, up from -12% year over year in the third quarter. Facebook’s e-commerce is also gaining traction.“The company did a great job in 2020 of preparing Facebook Shops and many other e-commerce ad products (IG product tags, etc.) for the 4Q holiday season, and adoption was very robust based on our checks,” Barclays analysts said. ‘’",0.9856

2624,"Facebook and Google could lose bargaining power under upcoming U.S. bill to help news outletsWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bipartisan members of Congress plan to introduce a bill in coming weeks to make it easier for smaller news organizations to negotiate with Big Tech platforms, said Rep. Ken Buck, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel.The U.S. bill would be introduced at a time when Australia is in a pitched battle with Facebook. The social media giant blocked news feeds and other pages - including those of charities, and health and emergency services - as part of a dispute over a proposed law that would require it and Google to pay news outlets whose links drive traffic to their platforms, or agree on a price through arbitration.Buck, who was named the ranking member this month, told Reuters on Thursday the panel would bring out a series of antitrust bills and the first one in the coming weeks would allow smaller news organizations to negotiate collectively with Facebook and Alphabet's Google.Social media companies use news to attract customers and have been accused by news publishers of not sharing enough advertising revenue with them. The legislation could boost sales in the struggling news business.While Facebook has fought publishers, Google has struck deals with them in France, Australia and other countries.Google announced this week that it had agreed to a global deal with News Corp that involved ""significant payments"" to the news organization, in one of the most extensive deals of its kind.Smaller publishers using Google's ad sales technology have for years griped about their bigger competitors getting more favorable revenue-sharing deals from the search giant.The news industry is undeniably struggling, with employment at U.S. newspapers down by half since 2008 amid tumbling advertising revenue and changing media habits, according to data from Pew Research.""What publishers have experienced is that platforms go to them one by one, make them sign NDAs and try to optimize per publisher without publishers being able to compare notes,"" said David Chavern, president and chief executive officer of the News Media Alliance, an industry trade group that is promoting the bill.“Big national publishers probably have the capacity to get their own deals. If you look at smaller publishers, the only way to get some fair value is if they act together.""In October, the antitrust subcommittee's majority report detailed abuses by tech giants such as Google and Facebook. In his own report, Buck and three fellow Republicans expressed interest in some changes in antitrust law aimed at strengthening enforcers.Buck said he wanted the focus to remain on the tech giants. ""The biggest threat to the free market economy is big tech and it (potential legislation) should be fairly tightly focused on that,"" he said.",0.9977

During the fight, Facebook blacked out Australian news pages and only restored them once the government granted concessions.

The Facebook Live feature is a great option for users to share with their peeps and friends but why doesn't Facebook work out a program for musicians and other entertainers to receive proper tips during a live stream. I see a lot of entertainers using Facebook live to advertise their Patreon channels; the free publicity is great for them but why doesn't Facebook find a way to keep the entertainers live on Facebook rather than moving their audience to another platform? I know, it's all about the money. If Facebook provided a proper way for customers to tip entertainers then the entertainment with stay on Facebook. Sadly, Facebook invented a STAR system for tipping and that system takes 40% up front away from Facebook customers so less than 60% reaches the entertainer. This is a very bad and backwards system. Entertainers should get 100% of their tips up to a certain agreed upon minimum then split the rest with the house (in this case Facebook) in some logical fashion that entertainers are willing to accept... Perhaps a quick review of whatever percentage Patreon takes would give Facebook an idea of what's appropriate. Regardless, taking money up front away for those who want to tip seems like the worst possible approach. That is why the STAR system is failing and it's why entertainers are just using Facebook as a free mechanism for promoting the Patreon accounts.",0.9964

2818,"A Sneak Peek at the Apple Feature That Keeps Facebook Up at NightOf all the privacy-preserving goodies Apple promised to roll into the iOS 14 update, its so called “Tracking Transparency” alerts were probably the most controversial, stirring up enough pushback from fellow tech giant Facebook that the feature ended up being delayed past its original autumn deadline.Now it’s looking like Apple’s waited long enough. A user with beta access to the upcoming iOS 14.4 update shared a screenshot on a MacRumors’ forum showing the NBA official app asking to track their activity across non-NBA apps and websites. In the customizable fine print that accompanies these tracking prompts, the NBA’s app notes that it’ll use this data to offer “a better and personalized ad experience”—whatever that means.Per MacRumors, it also looks like some folks using older versions of iOS 14 have also started getting these alerts on particular apps, albeit “rather inconsistently.”To briefly recap, the idea of Apple’s so-called “AppTrackingTransparency framework”—or just ATT for short—is to give users control over the amount of data that the apps on their phones are allowed to hoover up. Arguably, the juiciest piece of data that users are getting control over with the update would be their phone’s advertising identifier, or IDFA. We’ve covered the IDFA in depth before, but in a nutshell, it’s a string of characters that identifies your specific phone across all of the apps that you use. Being able to access this particular ID doesn’t only allow advertisers to track you from app to app, but in tons of other ways as well.Naturally, most advertisers were a bit peeved at the idea that Apple would be siphoning off their data supply. And the face of this peeved party, ironically enough, was Facebook. We’ve mentioned before that outside of Instagram, WhatsApp, and its flagship blue app, Facebook also has an external “advertising network” that siphons off tidbits of consumer’s phone data through non-Facebook apps in order to let those app’s users get retargeted across Facebook’s myriad platforms. Losing access to the IDFA, in particular, means that this Ad Network is losing a ton of valuable consumer data, which means Facebook, in turn, is losing ad dollars that were historically used to target that data.That said, I think we can all agree that as far as companies go, Facebook isn’t really the most sympathetic player. This is probably why its tactic over the past few months has been hamfistedly telling us that the ATT update has the potential to cripple the small businesses that rely on its ad platform for their day-to-day work. Since August, we’ve seen this message rolled out on press calls, corporate blog posts, and—as of last week—two full-page newspaper ads.Facebook, for its part, is kind of fuzzy on how small businesses will be impacted (besides some vague definition of badly). Now that there’s actual details coming out about what ATT entails, it’s looking like even Facebook’s own advertisers aren’t too worried about the actual impact that’s coming down the pike.",0.9967

2912,"Zuckerberg bribed the Australian government officials without success Facebook’s founder Mark Zuckerberg has lobbied senior federal ministers about the proposed code forcing the digital giants to pay media companies, and the prime minister has engaged with Microsoft amid threats from Google about removing its search engine from Australia.With a lobbying offensive in overdrive with Labor expected to endorse the Morrison government’s code after a shadow cabinet meeting this week, and with a Senate inquiry continuing to hear from stakeholders – the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, confirmed the conversation with Zuckerberg on Sunday.Facebook has branded the proposed code unworkable in its current form, and has asked for digital platforms to be given six months’ grace to negotiate deals with news companies directly before being hit with mandatory regulations.Frydenberg told the ABC his discussion with Zuckerberg had been constructive, but the tech mogul had not convinced the Australian government to back down.With parliament set to resume for 2021, the platforms have engaged politically connected lobbyists and are pulling out all stops to try to scale back or scuttle the proposal.Google has threatened to remove its search engine from Australia and Facebook has warned it will remove news from its feed for all Australian users if the code proceeds.As well as confirming the high-level approach from Facebook, Frydenberg also revealed on Sunday that Scott Morrison had spoken to Microsoft, which operates a rival search engine to Google.He said Microsoft was “watching this very closely” and was “mulling expansion opportunities in Australia”.The government remained “in detailed discussions with Google, with Facebook, with the other players across the industry” – discussions that had been under way for some time.Australia’s major media players, hit by technological disruption and by the economic shock associated with Covid-19, have also lobbied extensively for fairer commercial arrangements with the platforms.The proposed code – a world first – aims to address the imbalance in bargaining power between the news media and tech giants.Google and Facebook would have to pay for displaying news content and provide media companies with information on changes that might affect their traffic – such as alterations to news rankings or the search algorithm. If they failed to comply, they could be forced to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in fines.The proposal was developed by Australia’s competition watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.Although Labor supports the code in principle, its communications spokeswoman, Michelle Rowland, said last week that the government needed to be clear with internet users and businesses what Google’s threatened departure from Australia – if that eventuated – would mean in practical terms.Frydenberg said on Sunday he didn’t “dismiss the threats” but “I’m not intimidated by them either”.The code was “the product of an 18-month inquiry, world-leading inquiry, by the ACCC, and at every step of the way, these businesses have been consulted”.As the process went on, the story from the platforms appeared to be changing: “The goalposts seem to be shifting because originally they had a concern with the algorithm requirements of notification, then it was about value exchange and then it was about a final arbitration model.“Now we’re told that if we go ahead with this, we’re going to break the internet.”Frydenberg said the government’s view was it was clear current practices had to change: “What I do know is that media businesses should be paid for content.”",0.9853

3075,"Apple CEO Tim Cook rails against 'purveyors of fake news' as Facebook feud rages onApple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook took to the virtual stage of the Computers, Privacy, and Data Protection (CPDP) conference on Thursday, attacking social media sites for allowing the spread of misinformation — an apparent barb aimed at Facebook (FB), though he didn’t mention its name.In his speech, Cook laid into algorithm-driven social media platforms, painting them as, “An interconnected ecosystem of companies and data brokers, of purveyors of fake news and peddlers of division, of trackers and hucksters just looking to make a quick buck.”Cook’s appearance followed Apple’s announcement that it will soon launch a controversial privacy feature that gives users the ability to stop apps from tracking their activity to collect information for advertisers. The feature could hurt Facebook and other apps that benefit from targeted advertising dollars.The feature, called App Tracking Transparency and coming to Apple devices in the next update for iOS 14, has faced heavy criticism from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who claims Apple is only making the privacy change to benefit its own bottom line.Apple and Facebook’s relationship has never been worse. They have sparred over privacy and data security for years, but iApple’s announcement at its WWDC 2020 conference that it was going to introduce App Tracking Transparency set the two tech titans on a collision course.App Tracking Transparency is a new pop-up that users will see when they download apps from the App Store that track their online activities to provide information to advertisers to better target their campaigns.Facebook, however, claims the feature will decimate small businesses that rely on its ability to effectively target ads. According to the social media company, those businesses could see a 50% reduction in revenue as a result of Apple’s changes.Facebook even went as far as to take out full-page ads in The New York Times and Wall Street Journal saying that it was fighting to save small businesses from Apple. The irony in Facebook using media outlets, which have been crushed by it and Google’s dominance of the online advertising industry, was particularly rich.During his speech Cook lambasted social platforms that operate using algorithms, which include Facebook and Twitter, for allowing everything from conspiracy theories to violent militias to propagate across their services.“What are the consequences of prioritizing conspiracy theories and violent incitement, simply because of the high rates of engagement?” Cook said.“What are the consequences of not just tolerating but rewarding content that undermines public trust in life-saving vaccinations? What are the consequences of seeing thousands of users joining extremist groups, and then perpetuating an algorithm that recommends even more?”Prior to his speech, Cook tweeted that the industry needs transparency and reform.Facebook isn’t taking Apple’s moves lying down, though. During the company’s earnings call on Wednesday, Zuckerberg called out Apple as one of its biggest competitors. He added, “Apple has every incentive to use its dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps work to favor their own, which they regularly do.”Facebook is now, according to a report by The Information, considering filing an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in an effort to push back against App Tracking Transparency. That’s in addition to Facebook’s announcement in December that it was assisting Epic Games in its antitrust suit against Apple.",0.9902

They said the Australian approach would permit publishers to recover C$620million a year. Without action, they warned, Canada would lose 700 print journalism jobs out of 3,100 total.Guilbeault said Canada could adopt the Australian model, which requires Facebook and Google to reach deals to pay news outlets whose links drive activity on their services, or agreeon a price through binding arbitration.Another option is to follow the example of France, which requires large tech platforms to open talks with publishers seeking remuneration for use of news content.""We are working to see which model would be the most appropriate,"" he said, adding he spoke last week to his French, Australian, German and Finnish counterparts about working together on ensuring fair compensation for web content.""I suspect that soon we will have five, 10, 15 countries adopting similar rules ... is Facebook going to cut ties withGermany, with France?"" he asked, saying that at some point Facebook's approach would become ""totally unsustainable"".University of Toronto professor Megan Boler, who specializesin social media, said the Facebook action marked a turning point which would require a common international approach.""We could actually see a coalition, a united front against this monopoly, which could be very powerful,"" she said in a phone interview.",-0.2931

3192,"Drugs for Sale Plague Social Media PlatformsWASHINGTON, March 15, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Social media platforms continue to have difficulty removing illegal offers of opioids, steroids and COVID-19 ""vaccines."" Even after they have been alerted of specific posts and long past when they have made public pledges to do a better job of making their services safe for U.S. consumers, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Telegram are not backing their words with action, new research from the Digital Citizens Alliance (Digital Citizens) and the Coalition for a Safer Web (CSW) shows.The Digital Weeds 2021 report revisited past research conducted by Digital Citizens and CSW to determine if social media platforms have truly addressed illicit activity that was brought to their attention. Researchers searched for old posts and previous users who were attempting to conduct illegal activity. In some cases, the research teams found accounts and similar posts from the same users, whose posts were taken down years earlier, still up on the platforms. In some cases, the research teams found current accounts and similar posts from the same users who were identified years earlier.In addition, researchers also found that the fraudulent sale of COVID-19 vaccines, which was identified by DCA and CSW in February, remains despite calls for action by Facebook's Advisory Board to address COVID-19 vaccine misinformation and related dangers.""I find it amazing that the platforms have the ability to pinpoint a 47-year-old resident of Walla Walla, Washington who might be interested in buying retro-styled, minor league baseball caps from teams of the 1950s, but can't figure out a way to stop the posts pushing illegal and/or illicit activities on their pages,"" said Digital Citizens Alliance Executive Director Tom Galvin. ""The platforms have had a chance to correct this problem. How much more evidence do we need to present before lawmakers say, 'enough is enough' and take the action the platforms themselves have not been able to take?""Both Google and Facebook, once enormously popular, respected companies, are increasingly questioned by consumers as well as federal and state regulators for their business practices. But a lot remains the same: • Criminal activity and/or illicit activity highlighted in previous research, such as the selling of opioids, steroids, and malware, can still be found easily today. • Many videos and posts shared in prior DCA and CSW reports and/or with media contacts are still available across numerous social media platforms. • The platforms still have advertising from premium, respected brands running next to videos and/or posts for illegal and/or illicit item. • The platforms allow for communication between drug pushers and potential buyers. Whether by containing phone numbers and emails in videos and/or posts or allowing for conversations to happen in chats. • The platforms' algorithms amplify connectivity between potential buyers and sellers of illegal and/or illicit items. Researchers, acting as potential buyers looking for drugs, showed that when they look for drugs on Instagram, Instagram will in turn begin directing drug sellers back to the potential buyer. • When outed by media outlets, platforms will often take down specific videos mentioned by reporters, but not address the larger problem. This leaves consumers vulnerable to similar, or sometimes even the same scams, that inspired the news coverage in the first place.Ambassador Marc Ginsberg, President of the Coalition for a Safer Web, added: ""Our report is another abject proofpoint that so long as social media companies are unregulated and left to run wild, consumers will be exposed to the criminal web marketplace opened by extremists and terrorists hawking illicit, dangerous drugs to fund their organizations and operations. Until Congress acts, both the FDA (by issuing formal warning letters prohibiting the sale of illegal drugs) and the FTC (by prohibiting criminal operations on social media companies) must step in immediately to protect the American people?""",0.9903

Everything from your browsing history, to your location, your banking details, your contact details, and your fitness levels can be valuable for apps to store, use, or sell on,” Ivan Dimitrov, a digital manager at pCloud, wrote in a blog post detailing the research.“With over 1 billion monthly active users it’s worrying that Instagram is a hub for sharing such a high amount of its unknowing users’ data.”The second worst offender for sharing the personal data of its users was Instagram’s parent company, Facebook. The social network gave away 57 per cent of its users’ data to third parties, which can include companies that are associated with the company.Food delivery apps Uber Eats and Deliveroo also scored badly, both featuring in the top 10 alongside LinkedIn, Trainline, YouTube, Duolingo and eBay.By contrast, fellow food delivery apps Just Eat, Grubhub and My McDonald’s were among the few apps that gave away no user data at all.Other apps that protected their users’ data included privacy-centric messaging apps Signal and Telegram, as well as online streaming services BBC iPlayer and Netflix.Apple’s new privacy labels have forced tech companies to publicise exactly how they are tracking people, recently prompting privacy-focussed search engine DuckDuckGo to accuse Google of “spying on users”.After delaying the release of its privacy labels, Google revealed this week that it collects users’ location, financial info, browsing history and audio data.“After months of stalling, Google finally revealed how much personal data they collect in Chrome and the Google app,” stated a post on DuckDuckGo’s Twitter account. “No wonder they wanted to hide it.”When the App Store update was first announced last year, privacy advocates said the new transparency standard was critical for the future of online privacy.“The changes mean people can more easily consider privacy issues when choosing whether or not to buy or download an app,” the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA, who helped push for the new labels.“Safeguarding people’s control over their data is important for protecting privacy as well as for the healthy operation of the market.”",0.9963

In $SNAP's Analyst Day event they highlight the ways they are going to sustain strong engagement. At this point in time, $SNAP has differentiated itself enough from the competition that the risk of competition grabbing users is likely minimal. It's happened before, but $SNAP's platform has grown and evolved since then, adding new, entrenching features to retain and add users. In addition, because of it's privacy-centric and content-moderation lite structure, $SNAP will not incur costs that a $FB or $TWTR would from content moderation, meaning their operating margins could actually be much higher long-term than anything $FB or $TWTR is doing.

3334,"Anger mounts as Facebook's Australia news ban sweeps up charities, government pagesSYDNEY (Reuters) - Dozens of Australian companies, charities and information providers reacted with anger on Thursday after being shut down by Facebook, imploring the social media giant to restore their pages as calls for users to delete the platform grew.Australians were blocked from accessing news in their Facebook feeds after an escalation of the proposed media bargaining code which would require the company and Google to reach commercial deals with news outlets whose links drive traffic to their platforms.But several charities and pages of official health, meteorology and emergency services were also blocked, along with smaller, niche content providers.Foodbank Australia, one of the many charities caught in the crossfire, said Facebook's response was ""unacceptable"".""Hours matter when you have nothing to eat. SORT THIS OUT!"" CEO Brianna Casey tweeted.Save the Children CEO Paul Ronalds said the charity had come to rely on the platform to communicate with supporters and members.""We also use Facebook as an important fundraising tool to reach generous supporters who want to support the world’s most vulnerable children,"" he said. ""Every minute that our page is down is another minute our message isn’t getting out about the needs of children.""Facebook had restored the government services pages by afternoon, but there were still small businesses and community groups who were left venting, with #facebooknewsban and #DeleteFacebook trending on microblogging site Twitter.Rachel Chappell who founded a Sydney-based community group 'North Shore Mums' nine years ago woke up to see her Facebook page with its 35,000 followers disappear.“We’re a mum’s website. We are small and niche. This is not fair,” said Chappell, who built up a small business for mothers, writing about family-friendly cafes and pets for the local community, and attracting advertising.""I think they are just bullies. They are shooting themselves in the foot. I spend my A$20,000 marketing budget to promote our content with Facebook,” said Chappell, adding the move had “completely shaken” her.Facebook's reach in Australia is powerful. It has more than 11 million users in a population of 25 million and takes in about 24% of the country's advertising spend, according to the competition regulator.A Facebook representative in Australia did not reply to a request for comment. A later Facebook statement said the ban should not affect government pages but ""as the law does not provide clear guidance on the definition of news content, we have taken a broad definition"".""CUTE CATS AND CONSPIRACIES""Several organisations posted social media messages directing followers to their websites or other platforms including Twitter and Facebook-owned Instagram.Journalist Jelisa Apps said many rural areas and country towns relied on their local paper's Facebook pages as physical copies were stripped back over the years. Other social media platforms were not as widely used, she said.""I've just checked my hometown's newspaper page. It's gone. This is a real shame. An undervalued audience having their news further limited,"" Apps said on Twitter.Peter Lewis, director of the Australia Institute's Centre for Responsible Technology said Facebook's decision would make it a weaker social network.Facebook ""is destroying its social licence to operate,"" Lewis said.""Without fact-based news to anchor it, Facebook will become little more than a cute cats and conspiracy theories (page),"" he added.""If Facebook determines to treat Australians with such contempt, Australians should respond by ending its use of Facebook and using alternate ways to connect online.""",0.9973

Those investors who have been conditioned these past five years to only expect big tech stocks Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to do one thing — go up, and go up huge — may be in for a wake-up call in coming quarters as the newly emboldened Democratic party looks to drop the regulatory hammer on these powerful giants.“We continue to anticipate that the regulatory overhang for mega-cap internet companies will continue in 2021 and see a breakup of Facebook to be most structurally concerning for investors given a difficult/expensive unwind and that separate Instagram and WhatsApp platforms would likely compete directly for usage and advertisers,” says BofA Securities tech analyst Justin Post.Post outlines numerous regulatory concerns for investors in Facebook, Amazon and Google, which could collectively weigh on the multiples the already expensive stocks trade on.“With the Democratic sweep, we see a slightly higher possibility for new legislation that: 1) establishes a Privacy Bill of Rights restricting the use of personal data; 2) re-defines market power in large tech; and, 3) regulates companies as digital utilities,” Post explains. “We also think the Democratic Party-led government will even more strongly support the DoJ [Department of Justice] and FTC [Federal Trade Commission] efforts to break-up Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook. President-elect Biden’s decision to name Bruce Reed (helped craft the landmark 2018 California Consumer Privacy Act) as top technology advisor signals higher probability for the administration to adopt a regulatory agenda focused on consumer policy protection (similar to GDPR in Europe and CCPA in California).”Post adds the recent insurrection on Capitol Hill will likely renew calls among lawmakers to make social media platforms “more accountable” and also revoke Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.The end result of these would-be government actions on Facebook, Amazon and Google, Post argues, may be pressured sales, increased operating costs and outgoing cash flow to pay fines. More often than not, these are conditions for a stock price to lose value as investors recalculate the future of the underlying company.And the selling could become pronounced.Enthusiasm for big tech stocksFacebook, Amazon and Google remain the most owned three tech stocks among large cap active managers, according to Post’s research. In other words, these are some of the most crowded trades on Wall Street that may be unwound quickly as a the government sticks a pin in the big-cap tech bubble.Despite the growing regulatory risks (fueled in part by 38 U.S. state attorneys general in December signing an antitrust lawsuit against Google, as Yahoo Finance’s Alexis Keenan details here) ushered in by the arrival of a Blue Wave in government, the stock prices of tech’s three most scrutinized names continue to be loved on Wall Street.All three stocks outperformed the S&P 500 (again) in 2020, paced by a 70% rise in Amazon as U.S. consumers relied heavily on the platform during the COVID-19 pandemic.But the enthusiasm for big-cap tech stocks — often seen through the prism of the FAANG complex [Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google] — has waned to kick off 2021 perhaps because of the reality that new regulations from a Democratic-controlled government are coming.Shares of the FAANG stocks are all lower (Facebook is the worst performer, down 8.1%) year-to-date compared to the 1.1% gain for the S&P 500.Not helping sentiment on big-cap tech stocks right now is the specter of a new $1.9 trillion stimulus plan from the Biden administration. If enacted in any form, the stimulus could lead to a sizable rotation into cyclical sectors of the market from “safe-haven’ big-cap tech stocks.“The spending comes at an interesting junction for analysts and investors as it will no doubt mean further EPS upgrades. It will also mean that many early cycle S&P 500 sectors will see faster earnings revisions than the popular FAANG+ and IT which dominated investor attention in 2020,”",0.9826

But Lewis says he has already talked to his kids about pornography, fearing exploitative images of children may pop up on their feeds.“To be sexually abused and then for it to be put on camera and for millions of strangers to watch it for enjoyment, that’s sick,” said Lewis.In 2020, 1,400 companies reported over 21 million incidents related to child pornography. Google had over 546,00 incidents; TikTok over 22,000.“We are talking about crime scene photos,” said NCMEC's Lauren Coffren. “We're taking about the sexual abuse of the child that unfortunately has been memorialized.”Coffren believes the numbers could be even higher than reported.“The real story behind it is that some companies are making an awful lot of reports and some companies are not making a lot of reports,” said Coffren.“We have victims who are 20 years pass the actual hands-on or contact of use, and they are still suffering as a victim because the imagery is still being distributed,” said Coffren. “It’s the crime that never ends.”“As a parent I make a point of it to put certain restraints on my kids phone, there’s parental blocks on everything,” said Lewis.",-0.9523

3513,"The Creepy Way Facebook, Google And Amazon Profit Off Our Private DataOur lives and habits are being tracked. Every time we tap in a Google search, every time we click “Like” on Facebook and every time we make an Amazon purchase, we are giving away information about ourselves: our thoughts, our preferences, our behaviors.We are providing data that can be packaged up and sold to companies, which then use that data to try to modify our behavior and steer us toward buying products or using their services.Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff calls it the commodification of human data. In the information era we live in, she explains in her new book, “The Age Of Surveillance Capitalism,” we are the marketable product. It’s a terrifying idea.So, what is surveillance capitalism?It’s important to know that in many ways, surveillance capitalism differs dramatically from other forms of capitalism over the last couple of centuries. Capitalism is claiming things that live outside the marketplace, bringing them into the market and turning them into what people call “commodities,” things that can be sold and purchased.Industrial capitalism, which dominated the late 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, famously claimed nature. The trees and the forests and the rivers — these are entities that have a life of their own. Industrial capitalism brought nature into the market dynamic, and nature was reborn. It was called “land,” and it was called “real estate.” That allowed it to be sold and purchased and become the source of profit.Surveillance capitalism proceeds according to this pattern, but with a dark and unexpected twist. So unexpected, in fact, that it’s taken us quite a while to catch on to what they’ve actually done. Surveillance capitalism claims private human experience for the market dynamic.It says that private human experience is now a source of free, raw material — just like harvesting wheat or collecting ore from a mountain side. [We are] a source of free, raw material that can be processed into data, and those data can be computed and sold and purchased and owned.That sequence has created the largest, wealthiest and most powerful companies — like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon — that the world has ever known. All of that begins with the unilateral declaration that private human experience is ours for the taking.Ultimately, what surveillance capitalists are trying to do is sell predictions. It’s not only to know our behavior, but it’s to predict our behavior. That’s how they make their money.Those predictions are not to improve our lives, but rather they’re sold to business customers who have a business interest in knowing what we will do next — because that raises the certainty that they have about how to successfully get us to behave in a way that serves their bottom line.",0.9948

3664,"Europe Publishers Turn Up Heat on Facebook After Australia Spat(Bloomberg) -- News publishers are urging the European Union to copy parts of a proposed law in Australia that would force Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google to pay an agreed price for their content.The publishers want EU lawmakers to force the tech giants into binding arbitration if they can’t agree on payments for snippets of articles shown on the platforms. They want a clause inserted in legislation proposed in December to rein in the big tech firms, known as the Digital Markets Act.The industry sees an opportunity to press its case after Facebook imposed a news sharing blackout in response to Australia’s legislative move in an unprecedented show of strength. Publishers have hemorrhaged advertising revenue to digital platforms for decades.“It has become clear that without the full force of an Australian style approach, gatekeeper tech companies threaten to walk away from negotiations or exit markets entirely,” said Angela Mills Wade, executive director of the European Publishers Council, which represents publishers including Axel Springer and The New York Times. She said the EPC would support European lawmakers seeking to ensure that platforms negotiate in good faith.The EU already agreed a separate copyright law to help publishers seek compensation from the platforms, after years of negotiations involving industry, officials and lawmakers. Andreas Schwab, the lead lawmaker in charge of the DMA, said the copyright law protects people’s ability to share content while supporting quality journalism online.For some publishers, the rules still don’t go far enough. France is one of the only countries so far to apply the copyright law, but its competition authority had to step in last year to force Google to pay for displaying news.When France rolled out the law, Google started showing stripped-down French news search results that didn’t include previews of the articles. The search giant eventually reached a deal in January with a French publishers’ union that it will negotiate individual license agreements.The tech giants are still finding ways to “wriggle out” of their obligations to publishers even with the EU copyright rules in place, said Wout van Wijk, executive director of News Media Europe, an umbrella organization representing national publisher associations.“We would welcome a clause that mandates binding arbitration,” he said.",0.9706

3666,"Inside the Google-Facebook Ad Deal at the Heart of a Price-Fixing LawsuitLawmakers have called for an investigation into the tech giants’ contract, dubbed ‘Jedi Blue,’ which allegedly allowed for auction riggingGoogle allegedly gave Facebook special terms and access to its ad server, a lawsuit brought by 10 Republican state attorneys general saysState attorneys general said in a lawsuit earlier this month that a 2018 business agreement between two digital advertising giants, Facebook Inc. FB -0.08% and Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG -0.98% Google, was an illegal price-fixing deal. Lawmakers are calling for further investigation. The companies say it was above board.The Wall Street Journal viewed part of a recent unredacted draft version of the lawsuit, which elaborates on allegations in the redacted complaint filed in a Texas federal district court.Ten Republican attorneys general, led by Texas’ Ken Paxton, say Google gave Facebook special terms and access to its ad server, a ubiquitous tool for allocating advertising space across the web. This and other conduct by Google, they allege in the final lawsuit, harms competition and deprives “advertisers, publishers and consumers of improved quality, greater transparency, increased output and/or lower prices.”Crucial to the backdrop of the Google-Facebook deal was the advertising industry’s movement toward an ad-sales method called header bidding.Header bidding helped website publishers circumvent Google’s exchanges for buying and selling ads across the web. The exchange auctions ad space to the highest bidder during the split second it takes a webpage to load.Header bidding allowed the publishers to directly solicit bids from multiple ad exchanges at once, leading to more favorable prices for publishers. Google worried a big rival might embrace header bidding, such as the Facebook Audience Network ad service, or FAN, cracking Google’s profitable monopoly over ad tools, the states allege. “Need to fight off the existential threat posed by header bidding and FAN,” Google advertising executive Chris LaSala wrote in an internal document outlining 2017 priorities, according to the draft complaint.In March 2017, Facebook publicly endorsed header bidding. Google approached Facebook and in September 2018 reached the digital advertising agreement, the states allege. The draft lawsuit says Google code-named it “Jedi Blue.” In December 2018, Facebook announced it was joining an advertising program, “Open Bidding,” that Google offers as an alternative to header bidding.TERMS OF THE ‘JEDI BLUE’ CONTRACTThese are some of the alleged stipulations in the Google-Facebook contract, according to a recent, unredacted draft of the states’ lawsuit viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Google says it is common to match users through trackers known as cookies, and it publicly offers that service to other buyers. • Facebook pays Google a 5% to 10% transaction fee. (Google says this fee is standard.) • Google helps Facebook recognize mobile and web users. • Facebook bids to show ads to 90% of users it recognizes. • Facebook has 300 millisecond “timeout” to recognize user and bid. Some other participants have shorter, 160 millisecond timeout. • Facebook is locked into spending $500 million annually starting in the fourth year.In return, the states allege in the final suit, Google gave Facebook special treatment. Among other things, it allowed Facebook to send bids directly into Google’s widely used software, known as an ad server, the draft lawsuit says.Typically, bidders go through an exchange, which sends the winner on to Google’s server. By circumventing the middleman, Facebook could face less competition and save money. Google barred Facebook from discussing pricing terms publicly, the draft says.Google also told Facebook which ad opportunities were likely produced by bots rather than by consumers, and it didn’t charge Facebook for those impressions, according to the draft suit. Other auction participants asked Google for the same information but were denied it, the final lawsuit says, redacting the information in question.Any bidder without that information would be at a disadvantage, said Adam Heimlich, CEO of ad technology company Chalice Custom Algorithms LLC. “It’s like saying CarMax has the ability to tell when they have a junky used car, and they don’t tell you,” he said. Mr. Heimlich accused Google of harming competition at a Senate hearing this year.Unlike other types of antitrust cases, which can require complex market analysis and the sussing out of business motivations, agreements to fix prices or rig auctions are inherently illegal, said Harry First, a New York University antitrust law professor who was once the head of New York state’s antitrust enforcement bureau.“The only defense that a court will hear is, ‘We didn’t do it,’ ” he said.",0.9834

Facebook and Google had opposed the initial version of the legislation, which would have allowed media outlets to bargain either individually or collectively with them — and to enter binding arbitration if the parties couldn't reach an agreement.Facebook even shut down news pages in Australia last week in opposition to the legislation. But it restored them earlier this week after the country made some changes to the code, including a provision that ""must take into account whether a digital platform has made a significant contribution to the sustainability of the Australian news industry through reaching commercial agreements with news media businesses.""Arbitration, meanwhile, will now only be used as a ""last resort"" following a period of ""good faith"" mediation.",0.9722

3892,"Following An Insurrection, Lawmakers And State Attorneys General Are Asking Facebook To Halt Ads Of Military Gear“Whether through negligence or with full knowledge, Facebook is placing profit ahead of our Nation’s democracy.”Three senators and four attorneys general demanded Facebook pause or permanently halt the advertisement of military goods and tactical gear following last week’s insurrection at the US Capitol.Two letters — one signed by senators from Illinois, Connecticut, and Ohio, and the other from the attorneys general of Massachusetts, New Jersey, Illinois, and Washington, DC — cited Facebook’s role in allowing extremists to organize the Capitol riot and asked its leaders reexamine how they were profiting from national turmoil. Facebook was showing ads for body armor, gun targets, and other weapon accessories in the News Feeds of people who had engaged with content about the attempted coup or followed extremist and far-right organizations on the platform.“Facebook must hold itself accountable for how domestic enemies of the United States have used the company’s products and platform to further their own illicit aims,” wrote Sens. Tammy Duckworth, Richard Blumenthal, and Sherrod Brown. “Whether through negligence or with full knowledge, Facebook is placing profit ahead of our Nation’s democracy.”Facebook employees had raised concerns internally about the ads. “I’m seeing ads for tactical armor in my news feed,” one employee wrote on Thursday, sharing a screenshot of the advertisement. “When I looked at why I’m seeing these for the first time EVER it says the ads are targeting males in the USA. This is concerning to me, as I have never had any interest in this or anything like it.”Those ads may be shown to people who are being radicalized on the social network. Research from the Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit industry watchdog group, showed that a Facebook account set up by the organization to follow pages belonging to right-wing extremists and militant organizations was regularly shown ads for military gear in between posts casting doubt on the presidential election and praising the assault on the US Capitol.TTP’s Facebook account, which mimics the activity of a right-wing extremist middle-aged man, continued to see body armor ads as of Friday afternoon.""Facebook has spent years facilitating fringe voices who use the platform to organize and amplify calls for violence,” TTP Director Katie Paul said in a previous statement. “As if that weren't enough, Facebook's advertising microtargeting is directing domestic extremists toward weapons accessories and armor that can make their militarized efforts more effective, all while Facebook profits.""The senators’ note to CEO Mark Zuckerberg asked the company to “immediately develop and execute a Facebook policy permanently prohibiting advertisements of products that a reasonable observer would interpret as primarily designed for use in lethal tactical operations and armed combat.” Their letter also asked that the company hire an independent law firm to investigate what role it had played in providing a platform for the planning of the Capitol attack, as well as appoint a member to the board of directors who has “expertise in matters of domestic terrorism.”The four attorneys general wrote, “Halting this advertising while the nation prepares to respond to [an unprecedented] domestic threat is a simple action that Facebook can take to support this response and to help prevent another emergency like the one the country experienced on January 6.”The letters come as Facebook faces landmark antitrust lawsuits from federal and state governments. The attorneys general who wrote the letter are part of a coalition of regulators from the Federal Trade Commission and 48 states and territories that have sued the company for maintaining an illegal monopoly and stifling competition.Both documents were critical of a statement from Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, who said in an interview with Reuters on Monday that the attempted coup was “largely organized on platforms that don’t have our abilities to stop hate.” Despite the company’s efforts, Facebook has been a cauldron for hate and conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election.“The public comments of your COO are even more perplexing in light of a public report that your own employees internally flagged advertisements featuring semi-automatic rifles and selling body armor and other equipment as irresponsible and dangerous,” the senators wrote.“We are deeply disappointed that based on the existing facts and circumstances, we have little confidence in your company or your corporate leadership,” they added.",0.9799

And outside of China, Facebook's (FB) various apps, reported by the company to collectively have over 2.6 billion monthly active users (MAUs), continue accounting for a giant portion of this activity.Among social and communications apps, Facebook Messenger, core Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram ranked No. 1, 2, 4 and 5 in terms of downloads last year, respectively.

3927,"Australia's antitrust chief claims victory after Facebook standoffCANBERRA, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The architect of Australia’s laws forcing Google and Facebook to pay media companies for content claimed victory on Wednesday though critics said last-minute changes to appease Facebook favoured Big Media over smaller news outlets.After tense negotiations prompted Facebook to cut off news in the country last week, Australia offered a few concessions and the social media giant said it would restore news as the revamped bill looked set to become law this week.Even though Facebook said its concerns had been met and opposition lawmakers warned that smaller media players may be overlooked, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chair Rod Sims said the bargaining power imbalance had been righted.""The changes the government's done are things that either don’t matter much or are just to clarify things that, at least in Facebook's mind, were unclear,"" Sims, who helped draft the original laws, told Reuters.""Whatever they say, they need news. It keeps people on their platform longer. They make more money,"" he said.The endorsement from Australia's top antitrust regulatorwill bolster the government's argument that its hardline approach worked and may offer encouragement to countries such as Canada and Britain which have said they plan similar laws.Other countries have introduced legislation forcing so-called Big Tech players to negotiate with media companies for licensing fees for links that draw traffic, and advertising revenue, to their platforms.However, Australia will be the first country where a government arbitrator effectively sets the rates tech giantswill have to pay if negotiations with media companies fail.The last-minute changes include an extra two-month mediationperiod between any failed talks and state intervention and give the government discretion to release Facebook from the processif it proves it has made a ""significant contribution to the sustainability of the Australian news industry"".Facebook's vice president of global news partnerships,Campbell Brown, said in a blog post that the changes confirmedthe U.S. company could decide which news, if any, appeared onits platform and that it could avoid forced arbitration.But Sims said Facebook was always free to stop offering news- and had also been free to cut deals to avoid intervention.""This isn't a must-carry regime,"" he said.

Their decline began in 2020 and in a few short years they’re going to be in a free fall as the public confidence in them rapidly erodes. A major realignment will take place and MICROSOFT is going to emerge as the dominant leader because of a spectacular growth in its revenue and profitability. Coupled with the fact that CEO Nadella is a level headed person focused on Microsoft’s growth and not activism, investors will see the value in its stock. I believe even more investment will flow into the $MSFT stock starting this year.My prediction for other stocks:1 Investors will start realizing that $AMZN’s valuation is significantly higher than its peers. I believe the stock won’t surpass the ATH it saw in 2020. It is quite likely that the stock price may decline during 2021.2 $AAPL stock will likely grow higher during 2021, but its high flying days are over. Apple car is just a concept and it will be several years before a physical product is launched. In the meantime, Tesla Cybertruck and a possible low priced car may already be in the roads, thereby making Tesla the undisputed leader. It will be very difficult to penetrate its market. I see no innovation from Apple and investors will see that too.3 Stocks like $GOOG, $FB, $TWTR will likely stagnate and commence MASSIVE declines. I expect that regulations by governments around the world will act as catalysts to their decline.4 Other tech stocks like $WDAY, $NOW, $CRM will likely have more realistic P/E.",0.9655

The technique was invented in 1947 by Hungarian-born British physicist Dennis Gabor, who won the 1971 Nobel Prize in physics for his work. The technique has been used in electron microscopy since its invention, in the field known as electron holographic projection, but holographic projection did not make substantial progress until the invention of the laser in 1960. This technology is now used in so-called secret technologies known as Microsoft HoloLens and Magic Leap.Holographic projection is a kind of display technology, it needs medium, and it has to be done in real time, and it can interact with people. We call it a ""holographic medium,"" and it can't be created out of thin air, which is why it's so hard to make the technology popular right now. A holographic projection projects an image onto a holographic medium, thereby rendering the 3D effect in front of people's eyes. Also known as virtual imaging, augmented reality (AR) is one of the most popular applications of this technology.Holography relies on holographic phantom technology and uses optical imaging principle to present three-dimensional images in space, so that viewers can have a strong 3D three-dimensional impression.When 3D holographic technology is integrated into the traditional stage drama, the technology expands the imagination of the director infinitely, and provides a space for the stage art to be fully released. It outputs the concept of spatial imaging and forms such a holographic stage full of science fiction elements.Holographic imaging system uses artificial intelligence, virtual interaction, augmented reality and other interdisciplinary integration, in order to achieve the most realistic holographic effect of science fiction, and achieve the integration of humanities, science and technology, tourism and other industries.Unlike VR and 3D videos, holographic stage productions do not require any wearable devices to be worn. Moreover, AR technology, motion capture technology and other ""stage black technology"" can be combined to create interactive performance experience. Through AR technology, the actors or audience are collected in real time to realize the holographic interactive works performed by real people, virtual people and real-time collected audience on the same stage.""",0.9969

It was based on that model deliberately, as it provides a significantly better model for the protection of personal information than that in other jurisdictions,"" Chairperson of the IR Pansy Tlakula said.""We do not understand why Facebook has adopted this differentiation between Europe and Africa.""Facebook South Africa was not immediately available for comment, while questions sent to Facebook were not immediately answered.The changes to WhatsApp's privacy policy have come under scrutiny globally, with Turkey's competition board launching an investigation and a legal challenge filed in India.",-0.7619

They delivered $2.71 in the midst of pandemic, and show no signs of slowing down. Nothing has changed and they are in their strongest quarter historically with strong revenue from an extended presidential election and senate runoffs continuing. Oculus is now advertising, Instagram is firing on all cylinders, WhatsApp hasn’t even started to monetize, they are working on a new cryptocurrency, their marketplace is huge and gets no revenue yet, which is another potential Avenue for future incomes.They will easily report $3.50+ for the current quarter, bringing them to $10 EPS on the year...This means they are trading at under 27x earnings..

But a longer crisis was averted when the government made last-minute amendments to its media code that Facebook was happy with.While Facebook has signed letters of intent with three smaller players and Seven West Media, which publishes two newspapers, it’s failed to come to an agreement with the three biggest employers of journalists: News Corp Australia, Nine Entertainment and the ABC.The federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has been encouraging publishers to push for a resolution.",-0.7578

Similar to how Facebook users from 2007 were still using FB in 2017...and still to today.That's 10 years of more interaction and huge revenue potential.I also like the fact Roblox has been quite safe for kids as they have been very proactive from my research.And these kids spend at least 2 hours a day on Roblox.For me, RBLX is comparable to $FB, $TWTR, along with $EA.

For me, the time has come for a change in the company management team; they’ve had nearly three years since the Cambridge-Analytica debacle to improve public opinion of the company and they haven’t succeeded. Shareholders will never achieve maximum market share value if the current management team remains in place.

4482,"Facebook Faces Year of Reckoning After Showdown in Australia(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc.’s brief but tempestuous standoff with the Australian government over a world-first pay-for-news law is only the start of a string of regulatory battles that the world’s biggest social network faces in 2021.Mark Zuckerberg started the year on the offensive, blocking news across Rupert Murdoch’s home turf of Australia to fend off demands that Facebook pay media companies for content shared on its platform.On Tuesday, Zuckerberg struck a compromise after 11th-hour talks with the government on the legislation that’s also aimed at Google and is expected to pass Australia’s parliament this week. But a regulatory domino effect is already underway, with publishers pressuring the European Union to emulate Australia’s approach.With the prospect of more assertive regulation and even Apple Inc. questioning Facebook’s longstanding model of using data to better target advertising, the social media platform’s way of doing business faces being upended.U.S. legislators are voicing the loudest concerns about Facebook, with Rhode Island Congressman and Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline tweeting that the company “is not compatible with democracy.” Congress is holding hearings this week to consider tougher antitrust measures to rein in the powers of the company and other tech giants.Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison, meanwhile, said he’s discussed Facebook with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Canadian leader Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron and the U.K.’s Boris Johnson, whose government plans to conduct antitrust probes into its operations.Facebook’s Australia Face-Off Could Backfire Across the GlobeFacebook has struggled to shake off deep-seated distrust since the Cambridge Analytica scandal exposed failings in safeguarding personal data. It courted fresh controversy this January when WhatsApp’s privacy policy was updated to help it share more information with its parent, leading to several lawsuits and a flood of users joining rival messaging services Telegram and Signal.Facebook’s abrupt move to cut off news sharing in Australia -- jeopardizing credible sources of information about the coronavirus during a crucial time in vaccine rollout -- was widely criticized. But the high stakes gambit did help it wring some concessions from the government, which announced key amendments to the planned law on Tuesday. Crucially, Facebook and Google can decide what commercial deals to cut with news publishers, and will only face forced arbitration as a last resort.The “lesson for regulators and governments around the world is, Facebook is a formidable foe that’s willing to pull out the big guns to get what it wants,” former Facebook Australia and New Zealand Chief Executive Officer Stephen Scheeler said in a phone interview Wednesday. The Silicon Valley firm has the power “to essentially undermine a government position on a topic.”Among its other battles, the company has been hit with a lawsuit by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission alleging a “multi-year course of illegal conduct” and anticompetitive behavior. An unfavorable ruling in that case could ultimately force Facebook to sell off Instagram.And Zuckerberg, along with the leaders of Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc., will be answering U.S. legislators’ questions in March about the spread of misinformation online and the responsibility of platforms to curtail it.",-0.9745

It should copy it instead,” Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a blog post Thursday.Microsoft waded into the dispute down under earlier this month, when Google threatened to block its search engine in Australia over the proposed law, or “news media bargaining code,” as it’s called. Smith said at the time that Microsoft would never make such a threat.Facebook has also warned that it would consider blocking Australians from sharing news on its platform if the law passes.Smith used the occasion in his post to dive deeper on threats to democracy and journalism and the erosion of traditional news sources at the hands of the internet and social media. Microsoft also touted its MSN licensing agreements with 1,200 publishers worldwide, generating $1 billion in revenue for those publishers since 2014.“The legislation will redress the economic imbalance between technology and journalism by mandating negotiations between these tech gatekeepers and independent news organizations,” Smith said. “The goal is to provide the news organizations with compensation for the benefit derived by tech gatekeepers from the inclusion of news content on their platforms.”",0.9732

4641,"The Biggest Threat to Facebook Isn’t Apple, It’s Mark ZuckerbergThe CEO told analysts that Apple is one of its biggest competitors. That misses the point. During Facebook's earnings call, the company's founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, made a point of talking about the risk Apple's upcoming iOS 14 changes pose to its business. Those changes will require apps to ask permission before they are able to track users across apps and the internet.For Facebook, a company whose entire business model is built on the ability to track users, collect their data, and then sell targeted ads based on all of that information, losing the ability to track users could be a real problem. The thing is, Apple isn't stopping any app from tracking any user. It's only requiring that apps ask permission first. The only way an app won't be able to track a user is if that user says ""please don't track me.""That seems pretty reasonable. If people don't want to be tracked online, it seems reasonable that apps shouldn't track them. Apple is just adding transparency to that interaction and allowing users the choice.Clearly, Facebook doesn't see it that way.“We increasingly see Apple as one of our biggest competitors,"" Zuckerberg told analysts. ""Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do. They say they are doing this to help people, but the moves clearly track their competitive interests.""There is so much that we could unpack in that statement, but I want to highlight a couple of things. First, Zuckerberg is right, Apple is a competitor, but not in the way it thinks. Apple has a messaging product, but it isn't monetized. Apple doesn't show ads in Messages.Second, if Apple's goal is giving users a choice over how their data is used, what difference does the incentive make. If Apple is advantaged by respecting people's privacy and giving them a choice over whether and how their data is collected, I'm not sure that's quite the burn you think it is.Finally, It's hard to know how many different ways to say it, but if your business model is threatened by the idea that people will be given a choice as to whether you can track them, your problem isn't Apple. Your problem is your business model.For that matter, personalized advertising, which is just Facebook's nicer way of describing ads targeted based on your browsing history and activity, isn't a necessity for small businesses. Small businesses existed long before there was a massive social platform willing to take their money to show ads to its users.Sure, Facebook's version of advertising is more efficient, and maybe even more effective. But, even with Apple's proposed change, Facebook will still know where you live, how old you are, what your interests are because you tell it all of those things. For most small businesses, being able to target 25 to 30-year-old women that live within 20 miles of your salon isn't going to change.I'm also not so sure Facebook is actually worried about this particular change. The segment of its ad business that will be directly affected is quite small in comparison to its overall business. The real problem is that now everyone will be given a choice about whether to let Facebook track them, and the company logically assumes that most people will opt-out.And even if that doesn't have an immediate effect on its business, it does affect its brand. Suddenly people will be confronted with the reality that Facebook isn't free at all--it's just that most people weren't aware of the cost.Now they'll see a little popup that tells them that the cost is their personal information. Instead of facing that reality and making changes, Facebook has doubled down on the narrative that Apple is actually the bad guy here.That's why the biggest problem facing Facebook isn't Apple, it's Mark Zuckerberg.The smart move for Zuckerberg and Facebook would be to start with the idea that privacy is the given. If you can't build something that protects that, don't build it. I don't mean build things and then try to find a way to say it protects privacy, that's starting in the wrong position with the wrong motivation. It's why people don't trust Facebook.By the way, Zuckerberg isn't alone. Companies are full of leaders that can't see beyond the picture they have in their own mind of their good intentions.That's dangerous because it means they can't see the problems that everyone else sees. And that means they won't ever lead the way to a solution. You can't lead people where you aren't able to go. That's true for all of us.",0.998

4647,"Facebook Knowingly Profited Off Junk Ad Efficacy Estimates, Lawsuit ClaimsFacebook, which along with Google accounts for around 60% of advertiser spending online, has knowingly built some of its astonishing success on incorrect data, newly unsealed court documents allege. Incidentally, this may pose a problem for a business which generates over 90% of its revenue from selling ads. In a nutshell, this class action suit, which was first filed back in 2018, alleges that Facebook massaged figures for “Potential Reach”—an estimate that Facebook gives its advertisers for the number of people that might see their ad—to goad advertisers into spending more money on the platform, all in the hopes of reaching the people that Facebook had promised. These filings detail that some of Facebook’s top brass, including Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, were fully aware that the company spent years exaggerating the number of eyeballs its advertisers could reach. As first reported by the Financial Times, the suit claims that when Facebook’s rank-and-file proposed internal fixes for these inflated figures, senior executives repeatedly brushed them off on the grounds that their solutions would cut into the company’s all-important ad revenue.Thanks to these unsealed filings, we know just how inflated some of those figures were. Here’s an example: in 2018, Facebook told its advertisers that it had a Potential Reach of 230 million adults across the U.S., out of the 250 million adults that were counted by U.S. census data that year. But according to a 2018 Pew Research study, only about 68% (or 170 million adults) actually use the platform at all. Sandberg acknowledged in an internal email that “she’d known about problems with Potential Reach for years.” But she repeatedly shot down employee’s attempts to rectify those figures, according to the filing.Internally, employees acknowledged that while the product billsitself as an estimate for how many “people” your ad might reach, it is, at best, an estimate for the number of accounts—including the untold numbers of fakes and duplicates. Some employees even ran the numbers in 2018, just to see what would happen if known duplicate accounts were cut out of Potential Reach, and saw a 10% drop in the numbers advertisers were given. Facebook chose not to cut them. When one of the product managers on the Potential Reach team later suggested tweaking the way they talked about these figures—like, say, replacing the word “people” with the word “accounts”—his suggestion was shot down over worries about the “significant” impact it might have on Facebook’s ad revenue. Per the suit, the manager responded that “it’s revenue we should have never made given the fact it’s based on wrong data.”In a lot of ways, this case mirrors another high-profile advertiser suit that hit the company in 2016 alleging Facebook knowingly withheld some serious problems with the metrics for its video ads for the sake of pulling down more money from those video ad partners. In 2019, Facebook settled the claim for a $40 million dollar sum that, as others have pointed out, is pretty much chump change to a company that earns tens of billions of dollars in ad revenue per year.And apparently, Facebook didn’t learn much from that slap on the wrist. When it comes to the ongoing problems with Potential Reach, the suit points out that numbers Facebook continues to give its advertisers make even less sense, like telling them it can reach “100 million” 18-to-34 year old’s across the country. Census data shows there’s in fact only 76 million of them—and we know not all of them use Facebook.",0.9842

4651,"Apple Privacy Change May Cost Facebook, Google $25 Billion Over Next 12 MonthsGoogle could lose $17 billion in revenue over the next 12 months. Facebook has perhaps $8 billion at risk. The cause, according to mobile marketing professionals? Apple’s new privacy changes. Last year Apple announced that the Identifier For Advertisers (IDFA) would become explicitly opt-in in its next mobile operating system update, iOS 14. The IDFA helps advertisers measure ad effectiveness as well as track devices and people. In September, Apple delayed execution of that change until early 2021. But the change is coming, and most in the industry think it’s coming soon.What that means is greater user privacy.And what that means for Facebook and Google is impaired advertising efficiency. Unless huge numbers of consumers opt in to tracking, ads will no longer be as personalizable to our unique history, interests, and activity as they could in the past.In fact, Facebook itself estimated personalization accounts for 50% of the value of its advertising.Now mobile advertising expert Eric Seufert, who formerly led user acquisition for Angry Birds and other apps, has estimated the privacy cost of Apple’s change. He estimates some people will opt in to tracking: likely around 20%. (Facebook has stated it will ask for permission to track; Google has not yet revealed how it will proceed.) For the other 80% of people, however, advertising will lose some of the efficiency that personalization has delivered. Facebook and Google can recover some efficiency by better contextual targeting, he says, but not all of it.(Personalized targeting picks ads to show you based on your history and activity; contextual targeting selects ads based on on the content and focus of the app or website which you are using.)“I believe that Apple’s upcoming iOS privacy changes will significantly harm Facebook’s revenue, causing a roughly 7% revenue impairment in Q2 2021 in the base case scenario,” Seufert writes. “Subsequent quarters will also face revenue losses.”",0.942

4719,"Facebook Cuts Off News in Australia in Fight Over Payments(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. has started restricting the sharing of news on its service in Australia, defying a controversial proposed law that would require technology companies to pay publishers when their articles are posted by users.The ban constitutes the strongest action yet in response to the proposed legislation, which would force Facebook and Alphabet Inc.’s Google to pay publishers for the value their articles generate on the digital platforms. News outlets have demanded such payments, arguing they should be fairly compensated for their journalism as Google and Facebook capture much of the advertising market.Facebook’s decision blocks those in Australia from sharing news stories and stops users globally from sharing articles from Australian publishers. The action threatens to cut off one of the most widely used ways for people to access news and information online.It’s possible that Australia’s proposed law could set a precedent with other countries around the world that have watched Facebook and Google impact their respective news industries. While they oppose the measure in Australia, Google and Facebook have struck separate, voluntary agreements to pay publishers. Earlier Wednesday, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp., a supporter of the Australian proposal, said it had reached a deal with Google for the search giant to pay for journalism from the Wall Street Journal and its other newspapers.Josh Frydenberg, Australia’s Treasurer, tweeted that he had a “constructive discussion” with Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday morning Australia time. “He raised a few remaining issues with the Government’s news media bargaining code and we agreed to continue our conversation to try to find a pathway forward,” he wrote. A Facebook spokeswoman didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.Last summer, Facebook had threatened to block people and publishers in Australia from sharing news on its main social network and Instagram if the legislation were to become law. Google has similarly threatened to shut its search engine in Australia.",0.938
