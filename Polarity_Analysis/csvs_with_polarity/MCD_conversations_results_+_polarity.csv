Take away the $600 and watch how many people go to MCD for a job. But MCD is really backed into a corner, and let's face it, $8 + for a quarter pounder, fries and a drink? I'd rather go to CMD and have a much better quality meal for $9 and change (includes a drink).

Net income totaled $1.64 billion, or $2.10 per share, compared with net income of $1.88 billion, or $2.32 per share, year-over-year. Sales for the quarter totaled $5.37 billion, down from $5.75 billion last year. McDonald's attributed the revenue decline to the company's refranchising initiative. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of $1.99 and sales of $5.30 billion. Global same-store sales increased 4.2%, while same-store sales increased 2.4% in the U.S. The FactSet global same-store sales guidance was for 3.6% growth, and for the U.S., the growth guidance was 2.4%. McDonald's attributed the U.S. same-store sales increase to a higher average check, the result of price increases and menu mix. McDonald's shares are down 3.2% for the year to date, but up 2% for the last year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.45% is up nearly 9% for the past 12 months.",0.9074

The weight of this first-hand testimony, along with supporting government documentation and other evidence, established without any doubt the reality of these phenomena. These individuals offered to give sworn testimony to Congress about their encounters, but Congress has refused to hear them.

Without the tax break, there would likely be NO growth. The debt ceiling date just passed. How much more debt will the US take on to ""spur the economy"". MCD borrowed $2B, $2B/$141 = .014 => 1.4% new debt. How much growth does 1.4% more debt in one year represent? Kind of like the positive GDP announced by the US government along with the $1 trillion new debt. The GDP is $31 trillion. $1T/$31T = .03, that is 3% of the GDP in new debt, thus - 3% GDP growth from the new borrowing. I think they said the GDP growth was 2.5%, not sure where that came from , but -3 +2.5 = -.5% ""GDP growth rate"", thats negative.this is the highest price you can come up with the PE is 24 and that's after they borrowed $15B more (taking the total debt to $31B) to do buybacksthe debt is up $2B in one yearthe interest on their debt I calculated at $1.26 billion per yearthings are getting dumb at MCDthe recession was coming and they knew it and doubled ther debttraffice fell3.2 billion dividends and 4.8 billion spent on buybacksborderline junk debt statusthe US dollar keeps getting diluted.

In the past 12 years, EPS had a CAGR of 7%, while their long-term debt and dividend have grown at a CAGR of almost 12%. Meanwhile, MCD's net income has only grown at a CAGR of just over 3%. MCD management has been aggressively using debt as a way to pump up returns to compensate for the relatively stagnant performance in their business.

In the past 12 years, EPS had a CAGR of 7%, while their long-term debt and dividend have grown at a CAGR of almost 12%. Meanwhile, MCD's net income has only grown at a CAGR of just over 3%. MCD management has been aggressively using debt as a way to pump up returns to compensate for the relatively stagnant performance in their business. At today's price of $177 per share, I believe that MCD shares are trading at a 40% premium to their intrinsic value.

A lot of my Facebook friends and close friends are black. I do not have any racial bias. I do not see race I see people. White black yellow green. We are all in a group. We all have a percentage of a group. I see people the way they are. We are all one color. We are all human. We are a mixture of varieties that make us unique. We do not criticize or condemn a race. If we do we become not a part of the human race. Recently I was encountered when a McDonald’s employee treated me racist because I look more white than black or Spanish. I was served with disrespect and ignorance of knowledge. I was not given respect as a customer. Everybody who is a paying customer regardless of race should be treated equally and respectfully. The theory is the customer is always right. Unfortunately this was not the case. I am about to file a lawsuit against mcdonald’s for racism that occurred at my last visit that was not resolved.

Maybe they could look into having one with oregano or other herbs, for an appealing Italian taste. But the French swiss is superb, because of the onion dipping sauce. And if McDonalds ever develops a sauce for their grilled chicken sandwich, I'd start buying it again. The tiny amount of bland sauce does nothing to enhance the empty taste of chicken. Perhaps they could look into putting a chicken rub on their chicken, before the heat it. I'm not sure why anyone goes out and buys a bland chicken sandwich. Apparently some people like that.

1598,"08-14-2020 @DAVE ... ""That is unbelievably amazing... The EXACT same thing has happened in the past as well. Why doesn't the S.E.C. investigate something like that?"" ...Many possible reasons:1. SEC is in a slumber, but should someone with ""heft"" or stature bring this to SEC or FinCEN, they might listen.2. SEC is a well-known ""revolving door"" of people who used to or would like to in the near future work in a private sector, for a lot more money and bennies, having SEC / gov't service experience and relationships on their resumes. Many at the top and middle layers of SEC currently don't know where they will be in 6 months, so investigating WS financial shenanigans may not be exactly their priorities at this time.3. Many in the investment industry (some may now be at SEC and later be back ""on the Street"") have probably dined in one or more Danny Meyer's fine-dining Union Square Hospitality Group (USHG) 20+ NYC restaurants, and would like to do so again when some or all of them reopen; also Meyer is sitting on several boards of companies with potential IPO and some that will certainly need WS help with raising money through loans and/or other financial services that WS lives on (just like recent recap via dilution of $SHAK) and he is also involved in some feel-good non-profits and restaurant / farming community organizations. Maybe that's why they have been so brazen about it, they may feel at best ignored and at worst untouchable.That's why Meyer's USHG and Shake Shack share the similar marketing theme (easy to search): ""Union Square Hospitality Group's BELOVED restaurants, cafes, and bars..."" / ""Union Square Hospitality Group has created some of New York's most BELOVED restaurants, cafes, bars..."" / ""USHG is the hospitality company founded by Danny Meyer, and owner of some of New York City's most BELOVED restaurants."" / ""We love to reimagine BELOVED, classic dishes..."" / ""The (fill in the city) Shack serves up all the BELOVED Shake Shack classics..."" etc. etc. - it's in their 10Ks, 10Qs annual reports and all marketing literature. ""Iconic"" and ""cult"" are other monikers they use - that's how you sell inferior products at higher prices to tourists and brand-curious, and that's why they need high-traffic places like malls and terminals, stadiums to attract casual traffic and sustain high AUV - but their retainment rate is low, 75% of first-time visitors never come back, so expenses are high, gross and the net margins are low and the business model at these high valuations is not sustainable over long term.5. Now, an article about ridiculous valuations and of these WS + SHAK insiders stock shenanigans in highly regarded financial publication(s) or a statement by a well-known short-seller would go a long way to get attention of SEC / FinCEN, but in this environment of The Fed and Fed gov't flooding the market with trillions of dollars to bail out ""the market"" and ""leave no zombie company behind"" it's not a sure thing that it will turn into something concrete. After 2007-2008 GFC market crash and unraveling of Madoff's decades-long Ponzi scheme operation a lot of mini-Madoffs were uncovered and busted... I guess we are still some ways from Zombie Companies Apocalypse, staved off by Trillions of dollars, some flowing to companies that should be saved while most going to WS Mafia Laundromats ""washing"" money through entities like $SHAK and some other zombies, with insiders sharing in the booty.I and a few others on this board (and some articles in Forbes, SeekingAlpha, etc.) have been documenting for more than a year this financial engineering fraud and the ""love story"" between WS Mafia and SHAK insiders and there are enough forensic accounting evidence to bring this to logical conclusion - the question is, would anyone blow the whistle loud enough for SEC or FinCEN to wake up and do their jobs? Shake Shack CFO (""Chief Financial Engineering Officer"") Tara Comonte was promoted to President in the beginning of this year - ever wondered why? CFO + President is unusual and rare; CEO + Pres, Pres + COO, CEO + COO are much more common. Randy Garutti is completely incompetent as CEO flailing in different directions, trying one failed scheme after another (GrubHub exclusivity, trying to emulate Chipotlane with pretty ""Jetsons""-like sketches, ""digital ecosystem"" etc.), he is just a marketing cheerleader spouting usual slogans ""brand,"" ""opportunity for growth"" and ""I don't care about margins, I just want to sell more burgers - that brings in cash"" on ERs, ""investor conferences"" and CNBC.Well, we'll find out next week if only 1,666 left open from last $55 LIMIT order have been filled... or maybe they used the opportunity today to also ""park"" another 25K shares for Danny Meyer, on no-news low-vol day with $SHAK ""somehow"" being up nearly 3% during the day while $CMG, $MCD, $WEN, $QSR, $SBUX etc. were all down or just barely in the green at the same time?",0.9996

The income growth came from some improvements and a big change in the tax law. The democrats will take care of that most likely. Personally, I don't like the store ""improvements"", especially the Kioshs.Investor Place also mentions the dividend. I compared the dividend to the 10 year yield and got MCD worth $148 per share. Who cares about raises in the divident. You will most likely get a faster raise from the 10 year treasury. How about commercial paper, 6% or more...................................I saw an article that said a million people die per year from fast food. Half of that could be from mcdonalds. 500,000 x $10 M each (lawsuit settlement) = $5 trillion Probably won't happen, but if it did, wow!If someone could prove it statistically and present the proof......The important issue for me is the buybacks. They appear to have borrowed as much as the buybacks. The buybacks are as much as their income for the year. Its all too much. They are working so hard to push up the price of their bloated stock. Why, to sell it? Why are they borrowing money to buyback stocks and to give out dividends. Its terrible financial management for the company, unless they are terribly worried about getting debt downgrades. Is that the issue or are they just unloading shares of their own? Any way you look at it, its wrong for McDonalds. The debt downgrade comes mostly from too much debt. Look how much it went up in 3 years.",0.9789

2051,"For so many reasons including a historically high PE ratio 26.70, verses MCD's historic range of 10-approx 18, high debt MCD's debt is at 24 billion up 62% since the end of 2014, challenges to margin expansion in fast food and globally people are eating healthier, a very crowded market as there is tremendous competition in fast food, and MCD's falling revenue I have heard several unreasonable reasons for why revenue has been falling, I think it is a red flag for what is potentially in the future. MCD's PE is pricing the company for accelerated growth but this will definitely not happen in the fast food market as people globally are eating less fast food and healthier options and fast food has tight margins. If MCD transitioned to healthier menu options their costs would be much higher, food prep would take longer and sales would be less. Also the US new food guide recommends a plant based diet (the US is MCD's largest market), which means a vegan diet, the new Cdn food guide out in early 2018 is also guiding for a plant based diet, the UN actively promotes for health and other reasons a vegan diet as well...MCD obviously is known for it's burgers/chicken strips and soft serve ice cream the long term trends are not in MCD's favor. No competent analyst would buy MCD at it's current lofty valuation with large uncertainty around new growth of revenue and many risks to the growth inc. as noted competition, healthier trends, ect... It is novice retail investors buying at these prices and speculators.",0.9884

I tell you this is a nightmare and the people just want to walk in and and get their food and eat. So many people were confused and the staff was trying to help them figure it out, but in reality people were disgusted and walked out. I ordered my food and around 20 to 25 minutes later i finally got my order. When i got home with my food my girl friend asked me what took so long. She probably thought i stopped off for a beer somewhere. You call this fast food. I should of walked across the street to burger king which i did on Sunday and got my food in 2 minutes. McDonald's don't try and re invent the wheel. You are a fast food restaurant not Chili's or Black Angus.

And I believe there could be a turn whereas the US sees high inflation, mostly due to the excessive creation of money diluting the value of money. There are huge foreign holdings of treasuries and things can change fast. I feel MCD has not been protecting MCD for years, as they do buybacks and divy out dividends. The article here on yahoo finance says they paid out 73% of their cash flow as dividends or buybacks. Read the article to verify what I have said, perhaps I misunderstood it.Though MCDs is certainly doing a lot of business, I don't feel that the stock should have gone from 110 to 213, up 94% in 3 years, when growth may only be 5%, or even 7.8%. And with them spending 73% of cash flow on buybacks and dividends, the growth certainly is being manipulated to look more than it would be without this excessive misappropriation of funds. http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/advchart/frames/frames.asp?show=&insttype=Stock&symb=mcd&x=44&y=10&time=10&startdate=1%2F4%2F1999&enddate=6%2F2%2F2019&freq=1&compidx=aaaaa%3A0&comptemptext=&comp=none&ma=3&maval=50&uf=0&lf=1&lf2=2&lf3=4&type=4&style=320&size=4&timeFrameToggle=false&compareToToggle=false&indicatorsToggle=false&chartStyleToggle=false&state=11Also, note insiders have been selling and have done no buying.",0.9923

I get that some increase in markets is due because companies are thriving yada blah blah blah blah blah. I remember reading the Intelligent Investor (a book worth reading) and thinking ? holy #$%$ is picking stocks like gambling?? Of course it is. Two things I have learned (some the hard way). Predicting markets based on technical indicators is BS, mainly because predicting markets based upon retrospective data, particularly using small data, is hypothesis generating at best and must be tested prospectively to hypothesis test. Second, the assumption that any combination of variables can reliably predict performance of a stock assumes that historically situations like those occurring now have happened before.

MCD is a great company. it is still a cash cow. there is still some room for growth in the mcdonalds brand, but tastes are changing. this is the first of the last three generation of kids up to teenage years who have never eaten at a mcdonalds. MCD's reputation problem is viral. there are too many other choices at that price point. trying to provide higher quality food into that environment at that price point is a problem for MCD. it is not the 15 cent burger place anymore.KO diversified into the largest bottled water vendor in the usa and other ""healthy"" drinks to keep growing at a coupla per cent/year. MCD needs to diversify. they should buy some of those restaurants they are franchising from their stash(asset stripping anyway) and launch a new brand. MCD has the juice to pull it off but do they have the huevos. in the meantime, analysts are crowing about this quarter not counting because last year was abnormal so MCD will be worth 15-40 in a year based upon a plan that purposely ignores the reputation problem(are they really going to try to change their entire image in a matter of a coupla years after years of ignoring the signals!!! are they really serious!!!). the reality for MCD isn't any kind of a real disaster, not yet, and probably not for a long time but not in the form it is in today. for now, a pe of 23 is silly. the ceo is asset stripping to make the books look good and is borrowing money to buy back shares at the same time. that's hardly a long term strategy for a company with declining revenue. 2 billion dollars could have launched a mccafe stand alone franchise but this guy decides to pad his paycheck., and you guys love him? the real price for MCD is around 100 if that. it is not growing. it cannot match the beginning of what was hoped to be a long. persistent, increasing demand for breakfast all day. they could not keep the customers gained in the first part of the promotion one year later. brick and mortar retail is down 15%. ebay and amzn are having lots of special promotions. do you think people are making special trips just to go to mcdonalds instead of shopping? they aren't even ordering pizza delivered.",0.997

I had to throw it away after first bite. Wednesday I gave them another chance. Ordered food for me and my 81 year old mother and said WE CAN NOT EAT dill pickles, I heard person working saying take gloves off and then make them new. (there was one person there who has an issue with where i work, which I commented about) I tasted dill on my burger, so all they did was scrape it off. Talked to mom today and hers were even worse, said whole burger had a major dill taste. Told her not to eat any more of the 6 burgers I bought her.

Evidently the corperation has no one who checks on there francises.These problems been going on for weeks . Here is a sampleWent inside Sullivan, Indiana McDonalds 2 weeks ago Thursday and they were grossly understaffed. One guy cooking and about 4 people shouting orders at him the whole time he was there. He finally had enough and said the F bomb as loud as he could and said I quit and walked out. Took me 1/2 to get my food.Friday I go to same McDonalds at 9:30 p.m. and inside locked up and had a car parked across one of the drive thru's so was down to one lane. After waiting about 15 minutes the guy took my order and I asked him what was going on and he told me they were down to 4 people working. I asked him what they paid and he told me minimum wage. I asked him if he was aware the Mc Donalds just 20 miles up the road was paying $9 a hour starting out and he said they were talking about raising the salarys to $8 a hour. No wonder they cant't get no help. Tonight I go out to Mc Donalds in Sullivan , Indiana and the doors were locked up and lights all out . My question this has went on for at least 3 weeks. Does McDonalds not have a district person to go and check on franchises? Evidently not because I have called and left my name on how are we doing McDonald voice and no one ever calls you. Someone in cooperation needs to go out to that restaurant and see for themselves what going on out there. The franchises should be pulled if you cant run a restaurant better then that.

Does it say ""world famous CHEESEburgers"" on their signs? NO! They read ""hamburgers""! That time ago when both Wendy's & McDonalds were pushing cheese on my order, I would say ""No, then that would be a cheeseburger which I do not want"". I was sick & tired of being offered cheese, now It's up to me to say ""no cheese"" or scrape the consequences off the best I can. What a way to have a strong company ""bottom line"" with customers saving them money inherently by subtracting items & cost of such. Once again, their signs read ""hamburgers,"" not ""cheeseburgers""! I'm definitely against this ripoff! Add Steak & Shake to the list, as they also have cheese automatically on their ""steakburgers"" (same signage, ""famous steakburgers"", not cheeseburgers). Seems to be an industry standard now.

I still believe a brioche bun would be more appealing than a buttered toasted potato roll and like the idea of the trio offered dry with the customer having the choice of several sauces instead. I’ve never been to Popeyes, I occasionally (2 or 3 times a year) go to Chick-fil-a and haven’t been to MCD in over a year.
