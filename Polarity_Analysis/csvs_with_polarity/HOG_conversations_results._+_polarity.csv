39,"Harley-Davidson's Electric Bike LiveWire Sees Soft DemandHarley-Davidson, Inc. HOG electric motorcycle, LiveWire, is witnessing lower demand. Due to a hefty price of $29,900 and the model’s limited range, dealers are struggling to sell the electric motorcycles. Additionally, the company shipped the bikes almost two months late, which left just a month for dealerships in the Midwest and East to promote the model before the winter lull in bike sales.The target market for high-tech LiveWire is young, environmentally conscious customers.It appears that management has miscalculated the demand for LiveWire. The company anticipated the sale of the electric bikes to lead it to its former glory. Instead, it is predicted to witness more declines.With motorcycles losing its appeal, especially among the youth, Harley-Davidson motorbike sales are witnessing a decline. The firm is having difficulty attracting new buyers as millennials do not value the motorcycle status symbol. As millennials prefer convenient modes of transportation and ridesharing platforms like Uber, they don’t see owning motorcycle, electric or others, as an attractive option. Thus, the company’s retail sales have been declining domestically as well as internationally.Harley-Davidson has been witnessing declining sales trend for the past four years. Its sales are anticipated to decline in fiscal 2019 as well.Notably, over the past year, its shares have underperformed the industry it belongs to. Over this period, shares of the company have declined 17.4% against the industry’s growth of 5.4%.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderHarley-Davidson currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector are BRP Inc DOOO, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Lithia Motors LAD and CNH Industrial N.V.

We think this is a serious bubble in payment names.We sold all ORIT for a huge gain, close to takeout price now, what a move.TCF we added back in a little today under $22.50, we got out to soon, this is a good deal for both banks and a sign that there will be 400 deals this year not 200, already over 20 banks sold in 2019 wow! This will be for a trade only.This is really a wake-up call, for all banks, to merge now, sell-now or be left behind, you need size period.The new tax laws have helped banks for sure grow earnings, free money, thank you, Donald. Earnings reports are very strong, even without the tax cuts for many small banks, so far this quarter and the next 2 weeks all the reports, will be out, so far great reports, mean much higher stock prices.NUBK got almost 2 times book, wow. In sleepy upstate NY. Northeast banks always get a good price!Even THFF ,which opened lower after they announced there deal, is now way up from those levels.If you are very long like 15 names and “short” a few high priced ones, you should do very well again this year, as the market made a firm turn today for bank stocks, almost like the Internet bubble, when stuff like NVDA, gets crushed, the banks run and run, looks like the same kind of period we are in now as back then.Even JPM was very strong again today.I would bet we see 200 more deals by summer, in the biggest wave of deals in over 15 years.OPY will have earnings out soon, they should blow away the numbers and look for a push back thru $30 or $40, as a deal is coming this year 75% chance. Still our largest holding at 66% of all funds. Can’t wait to see if they bought back any of there shares under $25 last month. I bet they did if so that’s a huge statement for OPY. We added some RCBC under $185, AVBH under $21, QNTO under 12.20 and MCPH under $27 this month, and will keep adding these.RCBC worth $285 very cheap, strong management a sale is coming in 2019.AVBH worth $30 very cheap (as long as no bad loans, pop up, most risky but best earnings growth period). A sale will happen 1 to 5 years away.QNTO earnings out this week, buy heavy up to $12.50 before the bank does, cheap worth $17.00 no downside risk. CEO old a sale within 1-3 years. Just sold off in the recent year end downturn. 50,000 share buyback should start this week.MCPH cheap worth $41, no bad loans, buy up to $28 heavy, CEO old a sale very soon! Also, just sold off in the recent year end downturn.PA has way too many banks, look for deals in all our past names, many are still cheap enough to buy today and PA is pretty safe state for asset quality.We are 130% now long and 32% “short” for all very long accounts, have not had these kinds of numbers in 12 years, but there is a time to make money and it is now, bet heavy with “hedges”. Enough said!!!PFOH adding some back in at $28.50 or less, very safe and old CEO.We sold the last bit of IBKC also today, wow what a move.NKSH we sold all for a flat trade, better values now.COFS will add more under $23 if it gets there.TRCY added a little back in under $19.00I know this is a crazy market and you must trade it and take advantage of this, volatility.

They’re much more lenient with bad credit scores and the application process as a whole when compared to other motorcycle manufacturers.It’s not uncommon to be approved for a stupendously long-term loan, in an obvious effort to further extend monthly payment plans and make purchasing a Harley Davidson more attainable for the average shopper. While we most certainly appreciate this boost, it’s definitely a bit sketchy.

They prefer a more straightforward bike that just offers a great powerful performance rather than something fancy. Sadly, that base is slowly shrinking as technology has advanced.

Sad to say, but boomers will pass completely out of the market eventually.

It doesn't have to be that, but lightweight, inexpensive, transportation. A lot of the expense of present day Harleys is the paint: best in the industry. But people living on a tight budget don't want to invest in a world class paint job; they would rather it had no paint at all. They don't want to pay a lot for a place to park it, and they don't want to pay a lot to insure it or store it. They want reliable transportation that doesn't require a lot of maintenance, and what little it does require, they can do themselves.

215,"15 Reasons Harley-Davidson Is In Serious Trouble In 2020Harley-Davidson has been struggling for years to keep up with younger companies, but they're in serious trouble in 2020, and here are reasons why:There are things in the auto industry most take for granted: The Big Three will still be a force even if Detroit is in rough shape. Europe makes the best sports cars. And Harley-Davidson will always dominate as the best motorcycles in the U.S. But in the last several years, that last point has become less sure. The fact is that Harley-Davidson never truly recovered from the 2009 recession, and things have been rough for them in the last few years. CEO Matt Levatich abruptly left in March after a tenure that saw the company's sales slump majorly.This was before the current pandemic threw the entire automotive industry for a huge loop, and many companies are struggling. But even before that, Harley-Davidson was entering 2020 in bad shape. The company suffers from a poor image, a lack of good products, and numerous mistakes that make it harder to get back on track. While some hope they can recover, 2020 could well be the beginning of the end for an American institution.15 Supply Chains Are Breaking DownThe current pandemic is wreaking havoc with the auto industry. For a company already facing issues like Harley-Davidson, it's even worse. The shutdowns of factories mean that Harley-Davidson has lacked in the simplest materials for everything from bike steel to even rubber for handlebars.While dealerships can be open, they have no new products coming in, and repair shops also lack the proper materials. The pandemic is exposing how fragile the auto industry supply chains are, and Harley is struck by their breakdowns.",-0.929

Sales fell 27% in the U.S., the company's largest single market, 30% in the region including Europe and the Middle East, and 10% across Asia.At the end of the quarter, about 93% of Harley dealers around the world had their stores open, following interruptions earlier this year caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the company said.Overall, revenue from motorcycles and related products fell 53% from the year earlier to $669.3 million in the second quarter. Analysts predicted $761 million for the period, according to FactSet.Milwaukee-based Harley reported a loss of $92.2 million, or 60 cents a share, down from a profit of $195.6 million, or $1.23 a share, the year earlier.Excluding restructuring expenses and after other adjustments, Harley said its loss for the quarter was 35 cents, weaker than forecasts from analysts.Harley in July said it would cut roughly 700 jobs around the world, or about 13% of its global workforce. The company has said those reductions were part of its broader overhaul plan.Even before the coronavirus created new challenges for Harley, the company had been pursuing efforts to reach younger and more diverse customers and develop new products to kick start stronger growth.The company said its turnaround plan had resulted in $250 million in cash savings, excluding restructuring charges, at the end of the second quarter.Harley also said on Tuesday that it isn't providing a forecast due to the uncertainty generated by the Covid-19 pandemic.",-0.8412

1009,"Harley-Davidson, the iconic American motorcycle company, is set to lay off hundreds of American workers at its Kansas City, Missouri factory while creating jobs in Thailand.After laying off nearly 200 American manufacturing workers last year, as Breitbart News reported, Harley-Davidson is expected to fully close its Kansas City manufacturing facility, leaving 800 workers out of work.Harley-Davidson executives say about 400 jobs will be sent to the corporation’s York, Pennsylvania manufacturing plant, but union workers allege their jobs are being sent overseas to Thailand.In remarks to USA Today, a manufacturing worker who’s been at Harley-Davidson for more than 20 years will lose his job at the Kansas City Harley-Davidson facility. He says his job is going to Bangkok, Thailand, where the corporation is expanding jobs.“Part of my job is being moved to York, but the other part is going to Bangkok,” manufacturing worker Richard Pence told USA Today.“I am being directly affected by a corporate decision that I had no say in,” Pence continued.Harley-Davidson, though, claims that while its laying off Americans and expanding jobs in Thailand, the two projects are “unrelated.”Harley-Davidson executives said in a statement: The plant under construction in Thailand is a separate and unrelated issue. Part of our long-term strategy is to grow our international business to 50 percent of our annual volume by 2027. The Thailand facility will allow us to be competitive and provide riders greater access to our brand and our products in an expanding global marketplace. Increasing production capacity in Asia is consistent with the company’s long-term strategy to focus on growth internationally. It is not intended to reduce U.S. manufacturing.Harley-Davidson famously opposed President Trump’s pro-American tariffs on steel and aluminum, saying the decision would hit their profits, as Breitbart News reported. Harley-Davidson, though, was protected by tariffs in the 1980s under President Ronald Reagan, when he raised tariffs on imported motorcycles. At the time, Harley-Davidson was “delighted” by the tariffs.In 2016, Harley-Davidson decided to contract the outsourcing firm Infosys, which is responsible for the displacement of hundreds of thousands of American workers who have had their jobs sent overseas.

I at am not sure how many of the commenters here are motorcyclists. I have been riding since 1972 and have bought three new Harleys, the most recent a 2017. I have also owned BMWs, Triumphs, Hondas, Ducatis, etc. Every motorcycle manufacturer has their strengths and weaknesses. Yes, there is a demographic problem, and I am a perfect example at 68, but there are people who want to do things that are out of the mainstream. Motorcycles, and specifically Harleys, became almost mainstream from the early 1990s until somewhere around the Great Recession. Call it 2006 or 2007. The people buying new bikes today are riders for the most part and the folks who bought bikes as Butt Jewelry are mostly gone. Long story short, the only thing that could kill Harley is poor decisions at the top (think MV Agusta) and a huge increase in bad loans on bikes that are under water. Harley Davidson has been around since 1903 (or 1904 according to some folks) and my guess is that they will make it to 2103 in one form or another.

Most dealers won’t get any more units this year.Other analysts haven’t yet accounted for this production cut, says Spak, and still forecast shipments at twice the level he expects.

(“Harley-Davidson”) (NYSE:HOG) has been assessing the coronavirus (COVID-19) situation and taking proactive measures in the interest of health and safety of its employees, dealers and consumers. Its most recent measures include temporarily suspending the majority of production at its U.S. manufacturing facilities beginning this evening, March 18, through March 29 to help support employee health and further bolster coronavirus containment efforts. Facilities temporarily suspending production are York Vehicle Operations in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin facilities Tomahawk Operations and Pilgrim Road Powertrain Operations. “We recognize the unprecedented nature of this global crisis. In order to best support our employees and following the social distancing guidance issued by public health authorities, we are temporarily suspending the majority of production at our U.S. manufacturing facilities,” said Jochen Zeitz, acting CEO and president, Harley-Davidson. “We will continue to monitor the situation and take necessary steps to prioritize employee health and safety.”Harley-Davidson will continue monitoring the situation closely and make additional adjustments as necessary in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. The majority of its U.S. production employees will be on temporary layoff with medical benefits. The company will use this time to continue deep cleaning and disinfecting its production areas and common areas to further protect workers upon their return.Harley-Davidson closed its Pilgrim Road Powertrain Operations facility this afternoon after an employee tested positive for the COVID-19 coronavirus and is thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting the building, per the company’s coronavirus response protocol.On Monday, Harley-Davidson asked employees at its Milwaukee-area headquarters and Product Development Center, except those business-critical roles that must be done onsite, to work remotely through at least the end of March. Additionally, the company is proactively working with its dealers to assess individual impacts and its encouraging dealers to follow the public health guidelines in their communities for the safety of its consumers. In accordance with social distance guidelines, all Harley-Davidson sponsored events have been cancelled until mid-April.",0.988

For that reason think HD has painted themselves into a corner long term with expensive glitzy bikes. Changing up their bikes waters down their brand but their reluctance to change will be their eventually demise. Young people are about tiny homes, wanting less, new technology, and travelling. They are more discerning and savvy. Furthermore, generations are becoming less wealthy now.HD is about being cool. What is cool is changing and HD doesn't appear to adapt.

1525,"Harley’s brand strategy in the ‘80s and ‘90s was to go all-in on Baby Boomers. It was as shrewd a choice as a brand had ever made: Boomers were a large, well-established segment with money to spend, proud of Harley’s American roots, and eager to hold on to their glory days. As Harley built on classic icons like Marlon Brando, it cashed in on suburban executives able to plunk down thirty or forty grand on a shiny new taste of rebellion.Then, in 2003, Harley bought Buell Motorcycles. Buells were a faster, rowdier type of bike that had been created by a young Harley engineer a decade prior. Buells didn’t look much like traditional Harleys, and they would have been unrecognizable to Marlon Brando. But they had the same spirit, updated for a new generation. Buell was the first bike of, among others, Walking Dead actor Norman Reedus, whose Gen-X take on rebellion sounded more like the Ramones and The Clash than The Beatles and The Stones.At first, it looked like Harley knew exactly what it was doing. The brand marketed Buells with smart, edgy ads that read exactly like Buells rode: a younger member of the Harley family with a new spin on the same heritage and values. Headlines like “It’s a fast, rude ride. But so is life,” screamed, “Harley is more than just your Dad’s bike.” Harley seemed to have concocted the perfect way to stay relevant as its cash-cow core began to age.But after just six years, Harley killed Buell. The move was ostensibly a reaction to its core demographic: Harley’s traditional audience didn’t like sharing its identity with the new kid on the block, and Harley chose to tie its brand to a product and a demographic rather than a spirit and an idea. There’s been nothing like Buell for almost two decades, and Harley has retreated to its comfortable and well-known lineup of classic V-twin bikes built for Boomers. But today, aging Boomers are buying fewer motorcycles, which is why the decision to end Buell coincides almost perfectly with the beginning of the decline that the giant still hasn’t been able to reverse.",0.9962

The plastic shoes rest on the cam chains and actually wear out over time. Talk about a design flaw! When the shoes rub against each other, the friction and constant contact with the other shoes wears them down. Left unremedied, the entire engine of the Twin Cam will be destroyed.Weak durability of the shoes equates to frequent replacing- roughly every 40,000 miles or so.

1822,"AMF Years Were EmbarrassingFor those who aren’t up-to-speed, AMF stands for ""American Machinery And Foundry,"" and also very much stands for the biggest embarrassment known to the Harley Davidson brand.We have to give credit where it’s due in recognizing that Harley Davidson may have ceased to exist without AMF involvement when they purchased Harley-Davidson in 1969. However, 1969-1981 Harleys are among the worst, and the AMF years are definitely the worst period that this company has ever seen. During the AMF years, bikes were of bad quality when pegged against their counterparts. At that time, Harleys were nicknamed “Hardly Driveable,” and became the victim of many jokes. This may be an easy one to overlook – all you have to do is purchase a 1982 or more recent model!https://www.thethings.com/glaring-problems-with-harley-davidson-that-everyone-chooses-to-ignore/",-0.4805
