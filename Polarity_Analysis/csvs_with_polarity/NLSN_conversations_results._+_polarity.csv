The ""low 30's"" number is rumor mill. Blackstone and Apollo were talking $28 range. So somewhere between what it is now ($26) and $30-31 is where it will probably land. It will sell...what they do no one else has been able to replicate. What they need is discipline...and a common IT system internally (which is killing them right now).",0.8922

77,"None the less, Blackstone and Apollo are not dullards. They know what they are doing. They did’nt want to pay $28 because there is no way to get from under the $8 billion in debt they would be assuming. They can’t sell the asset to anyone, 3-5 years from now... this thing is not a utility and their customers are increasingly going to FB and SNAP to get their metrics. This thing only has $1.48 in cash per share, somehow manages to pay a dividend of $1.40 per share and has a total debt to equity ratio of 2.75. Think about it.... at an EBITDA of 1.47 billion in 2018, their DEBT/EBITDA is 5.7x which is way higher than many utility, energy, or material stocks. Either a dividend cut, more writeoffs coming or equity dilution.... since there is no cash to operate... and we now know that private equity won’t buy. This thing is fairly valued at about $14",0.1637

140,"The Activist SpotlightNielsen Holdings (NLSN) Business: media measurement Investor’s Avg Cost: $23.09/share Stock Market Value: $9.3 billion ($26.15/share)What’s Happening: Elliott Associates intends to talk with the board about operational and strategic opportunities, including a possible sale of the company.Key Numbers: 13.7%: Nielsen’s return since its 2011 public offering 183.8%: the return of the Nasdaq over the same time periodBehind the Scenes: Elliott is a very successful activist, particularly in strategic situations. Nielsen has two businesses: 1) Watch—its television and online video ratings, a virtual monopoly with 45% Ebitda margins; and 2) Buy—for retail consumer behavior information and analytics.Buy, which has been facing challenges, accounts for only 20% of Nielsen’s Ebitda, but has somewhat monopolized the company narrative. Accordingly, Nielsen is trading at a very depressed valuation. There are opportunities for the Buy segment to invest in technology to improve performance. However, the primary opportunity here is strategic. Nielsen is conducting a strategic review of Buy, but private equity may be more interested in acquiring the whole company.Private-equity investors bought the company in 2006 and took it public in 2011 at $23 per share; they still have their eyes on Nielsen. The company’s chairman works at Carlyle; another director works at Blackstone, and the former CEO of Nielsen is the head of portfolio operations at Blackstone. The company recently announced its CEO will resign by year end, which makes it an ideal time to sell the company. Nielsen said its board and management “welcome the views and perspectives of its owners, including Elliott Management.By Barron online, Kenneth Squire",0.9918
