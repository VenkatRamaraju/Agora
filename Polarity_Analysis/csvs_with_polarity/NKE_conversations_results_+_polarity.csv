Or here is another thought, take a trip to Dover Del and watch the C5's come in with Flag draped coffins of service members who were killed in action.

155,"Some questions for LeBron James:1. What exactly is your definition of ""systemic racism"" and in what systems does it exist? Everywhere? The NBA? In the neighborhoods where you own multi-million dollar estates?2. Why don't you live in communities you claim to care about, rather than presumably systemically racist communities?3. Why didn't or don't you send you children to public schools in communities you claim to care about?4. You say there is voting oppression and suppression taking place in the country. Exactly which voting locations are you talking about, have you informed the Civil Rights Division of the federal Justice Department (these would be federal civil rights violations), and are you aware that the voting locations and related decisions about the voting process are mostly made in the counties where the precincts are located? In other words, are you accusing minority public officials of oppressing and suppressing votes in their own communities?5. It's well known that you are a Democrat, that the organization you've help fund to promote voting is intended to elect Democrats, and that many of the issues you claim to care about involve matters handled by locally elected officials who are almost all Democrats. The Democrat Party is also the party that stood for slavery, segregation, Jim Crow laws, filibustered the 1964 & 1965 Civil Rights Acts, elected a former klansman as its leader in the 1970s, etc. Why aren't you calling for the abolition of the Democrat Party, or at least demanding a name change, and how do you justify your hypocrisy?6. Are the fans who pay your enormous salary through very expensive tickets, cable TV monthly charges, and buy your extremely pricey sneakers, jerseys, etc., systemically racist? Are the fans who are not systemically racist nevertheless being price gauged in order to subsidize your lavish lifestyle?7. You signed a tremendously lucrative contract with Nike; Nike does business in China, slave labor is used to manufacture products in China, and China is a genocidal communist regime that runs concentration camps and enslaves ethnic minorities. For all your talk about racism and oppression, isn't it true that you have enriched at the hands of one of the most repressive regimes in modern history?8. You infamously chided an NBA executive who tweeted a short sentence in defense of the oppressed people of Hong Kong, who are now suffering mightily under the iron fist of China's Communist Party. Don't you owe your fans, the public, and the people of Hong Kong a better explanation, especially when you hold yourself out as a civil rights icon?9.

376,"Nike to Investors: We’re Just Getting Warmed UpThe footwear and apparel company sees another record fiscal year ahead.Demitrios KalogeropoulosSep 27, 2019 at 4:09PMNike (NYSE:NKE) just kicked off a new fiscal year that's looking every bit as impressive as the one it recently closed. The company blew past management's financial targets thanks to strong demand around the world, especially in China. Nike's earnings jumped, too, as innovative product releases plus the shift toward direct e-commerce sales pushed profit margins higher by almost 2 full percentage points.CEO Mark Parker and his team said in a conference call with analysts this week that investors should expect more modest profitability gains ahead due to rising tariff rates and a planned increase in spending. But executives still see Nike hitting its growth targets while outperforming on earnings.Let's take a closer look at management's biggest takeaways from the past year.A woman jogging.Image source: Getty Images.Winning with innovation In any environment, Nike's foundation for success has always been great product. -- ParkerSales growth held steady at a 10% rate to surpass management's guidance. If executives had to boil down that success to one factor, it would be ""innovation."" New product launches like the React and Air Max shoe platforms delivered more than 100% of sales growth for the period, CFO Andy Campion said.Taking different perspectives on the growth, the consumer discretionary giant noted the strength in the China market, which expanded sales at a 22% clip and now accounts for more than 15% of the global business. The e-commerce segment posted transformative growth, too, with revenue jumping 42%.Expect more spending ahead With Nike's unrivaled scale and resources, we will continue to capitalize on opportunities ... to invest and extend our leadership and competitive advantage. At the same time, we're also increasingly offsetting our incremental investment through the editing of resources within our legacy operating models. -- CampionNike said investors can expect to see more aggressive spending moves like the recent acquisition of data analytics company Celect. Management sees these moves as a great way to use Nike's unique competitive advantage as the industry's biggest, most profitable player to extend its dominant position.The good news is the company can still improve its earning power thanks to rising sales prices and cost cuts elsewhere in the business.Better days ahead While the geopolitical and macro environment is increasingly volatile, and in some respects unpredictable, consumer sentiment for the Nike brand remains incredibly strong and consistent around the world. -- CampionManagement sees plenty of reasons to be bullish about Nike's short-term and long-term growth opportunities. These include the steady stream of innovative product releases, the development of a more direct relationship with customers through loyalty programs and online orders, and Nike's outsized opportunity in China, which has expanded at a double-digit pace in each of the last 21 quarters.These positive trends are being offset by trade challenges and slowing economic growth in parts of the world. And Nike is directing more resources toward its supply chain, marketing, and manufacturing abilities. Finally, exchange-rate shifts are pressuring reported sales and profit gains.Despite those issues, management raised Nike's growth outlook and predicted that sales will likely accelerate when compared to fiscal 2019. Profitability will rise a bit faster than previously stated, too, in terms of both gross and operating profit margins. Executives made it clear that they only see this improvement as a small step in their wider plans to take advantage of huge opportunities in places like China and in product niches like women's wear.",0.9995

540,"Widow Of Slain Police Officer Writes Open Letter To Nike That Goes ViralSeptember 7, 2018 A police officer’s widow, expressing her personal repugnance for the new Colin Kaepernick ad campaign for Nike, wrote a profoundly moving open letter to the company that has since gone viral.Kaepernick has expressed his hostility toward America’s police in various ways, from wearing socks with pigs dressed as police officers to comparing police officers to fugitive slave patrolmen.Sherry Graham-Potter, the widow of Pima County, Ariz., Sheriff’s Deputy Tim Graham, who was killed in 2005 when he was struck and killed by an oncoming vehicle while Graham tried to prevent an emotionally disturbed man from getting killed on the highway, wrote the letter, which starts by relating what happened to her husband, whose death left her raising two young sons alone. The letter then tells of the terrible grief she suffered after his death, and the Nike cap that she wore while recovering that became a symbol of the “strength and the sacrifice” of her husband.Then, the powerful conclusion.The complete letter is below:Dear Nike,I want to have a conversation about this hat. It’s over 13 years old. I don’t remember when I bought it exactly, I don’t remember where I bought it. But what I do remember is why I wore it.On August 10, 2005, I was a newlywed with two young sons. My husband Tim and I had toasted our one month anniversary the night before, and I was enjoying a rare evening to myself, catching up on reading and relishing the quiet. Until there was a knock on my door. I had no way of knowing that the small act of turning a knob was about to shatter my life into a million pieces. I sat numb and in sheer disbelief as I was told that my husband, while in a foot pursuit and subsequent struggle with a suspect that ended up in the road, had been struck and killed by an oncoming vehicle. He took his last breath lying in the middle of the street.What I lost in that moment is indescribable. I had to watch his mom be dealt the most agonizing blow a parent can face, and I couldn’t comfort her because I was in my own hell. I had to find a way to gut my own kids in the gentlest way possible, and tell them that this man they had come to love, who they looked up to, who cared for them as his own, would never walk through our door again.I don’t know if you’ve ever attended a police funeral, but watching grown men who’ve seen the absolute worst things a civilian can imagine, break down and sob over the casket of their brother is an image that never leaves you. The bagpipes haunt my dreams to this day, but it was the faces of my kids, the innocence that abandoned them at such a tender age that brought me to my knees.I had no choice but to move on. We trudged zombie-like through our days for weeks and weeks on end. I never left the house except to drive the boys to school, or buy food we barely touched. I realized that I had to do something. I had to move my body or I was going to crawl out of my own skin. So I put on the only cap I had and I went for a run. It was short, it hurt and it was ugly. But I felt, just for those few moments on that road, like a normal person. So I kept doing it. I put that hat on and I ran every day. Sometimes I had to stop and sit down because I was sobbing so hard. Sometimes I was so angry I ran until I thought I my heart would stop, sometimes I would just scream over and over again, but it still felt better than doing nothing.That black cap became a symbol to me, it is sweat stained and it’s shape is gone, the buckle in the back barely closes; but that hat represents my family’s rise from the ashes. It stands for the strength and the sacrifice we made loving a man who had a job that we all knew could end his life, every time he walked out that door. And it did. And I accept that.I still wear this hat, I wore it on my run this morning.And then I heard about your new ad campaign.Colin Kapernick has the absolute right to protest anything he damn well pleases. I don’t dispute that for one second. My father, my husband and many, many friends have all served this country and were willing to fight for his right to kneel.But that right goes both ways. I also have a right to express my disgust at your decision to portray him as some kind of hero. What, exactly has Colin Kapernick sacrificed? His multi-million dollar paycheck…? Nope, you already gave him one of those. His reputation? No, he’s been fawned over by celebrities and media alike. Funny, Tim Tebow was never called courageous when he knelt.This man, whose contempt for law enforcement fits him like a…sock, has promoted an agenda that has been proven false time and time again, in study after study. But facts don’t seem to matter anymore. This man has thrown his support behind divisive anti-police groups, and donated money directly to a fugitive from justice who escaped prison",0.9847

896,I see this as a slow burn for Nike. It wouldn't be until Q1 19 before this has any effect on earnings. Stores long have their holiday orders in. If there really is a backlash it will be felt by holiday buying. And Q1 wholesale orders will be down. The NFL is taking a beating over this kneeling thing. No one cared about Kap until now. I'm seeing the pro Kap crowd is much more an anti-trump crowd vs pro Kap crowd. The pro Kap crowd will forget about this in a month or so. But I have a feeling there will be a large silent majority who won't. Who will simply buy other brands more over the next year or two.

At minimum earnings should be flat with last year if revenue was truly up. I am looking at these numbers prior to G& A costs so the decrease operating income is not from increase in R&D and marketing.

To capture the broader market returns, the study used a benchmark from the Center for Research in Security Prices that it says is 99% correlated with the Russell 3000.In his study, Dr. So asserts that companies about to release disappointing earnings may choose to delay in hopes that underlying conditions may improve in the meantime, or that some other good news may occur that will soften the blow of the announcement. Similarly, he says, firms with positive results may want to rush the good news out before it can be overtaken or offset by any bad news.It’s fairly common for firms to shift earnings announcements by a day or two. It’s when companies reschedule by more than a week that investors should really pay attention, Dr. So says.

1640,"Sports and HeroesWilma Rudolph Born prematurely and later beset by crippling illness that forced her to wear a metal leg brace for years, Rudolph somehow overcame the obstacles of her childhood to become a world-class athlete. She won a bronze medal in the 4 x 100-meter relay in the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, but her true triumph came four years later, in Rome. Rudolph blew past the competition to win the 100-meter dash in 11.0 seconds, a record time that wasn't recorded as such due to above-average wind gusts, and then easily won the 200-meter final. Running the anchor leg of the 4 x 100-meter relay, Rudolph shrugged off a bad baton relay and overtook the lead runner to become the first American woman to win three gold medals in one Olympics. Underscoring both the era in which she lived and the ability of a great athlete to act as a catalyst of change, her celebratory homecoming parade and gala banquet were the first fully integrated municipal events in the history of Clarksville, Tennessee.Wow, she overcame a crippling illness; first American woman to win three gold medals in the Olympics; triumphed over “Jim Crow” era prohibitions. A real sports hero. Sure it is “history” and who cares about history anymore. Certainly not Nike. Their “hero” is a dude with a plethora of hair. Colin Kaepernick.So how was this Kaepernick rated? “ With multiple players claiming the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback had been blackballed by the league for sparking protests during the playing of the national anthem, a subject that dominated the past two NFL seasons and drew criticism from President Trump, The Washington Post tracked the statistical performance of each team’s top passer to see how they measured up to Kaepernick’s 2016 averages. Over the course of the season, 10 quarterbacks were worse than Kaepernick, 7 were about the same (plus or minus 0.35 ANY/A) and 15 were better. In other words, he was BELOW center mass. Certainly not the caliber of a Wilma Rudolph. But wait……… he is an activist. He wears socks depicting police who put their lives on the line everyday as pigs…… he is a social justice “warrior”! Well that is a matter of what you read lately. The most noteworthy part of a national anthem before a sporting event used to be a great singing performance or a riveting flyover. Kaepernick told the media after the game he sat because of the oppression of people of color and ongoing issues with police brutality.Here’s what he told NFL.com’s Steve Wyche:“I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses Black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”At least 72 people were shot, including 12 fatally, over the weekend in Chicago, another eruption of violence in a city that has struggled with murders and shootings in recent years even as the national homicide rate hovers near historic lows.Police investigated a 13th murder – the slaying of a 32-year-old woman who was found dead around 9 p.m. Sunday in a bathtub with her hands and feet bound. The Cook County Medical Examiner's Office was scheduled to conduct an autopsy Monday to determine how the woman, Shantel Boler, was slain.No arrests have been made in any of the incidents, but police said investigators have strong leads for some of the shootings.I guess he is not protesting that. It is funny how things can be so nuanced. I wonder if the pigs Kaepernick he so playfully had on his socks were able to help those mourning and in need. I hope his “take” from Nike was a biggie. And I am going to recommend other shoe brands…… AdidasAsicsNew BalancePumaReebokRockportSauconySpiraDang, and this week I was going to buy some Nike Huaraches. Well I should feel good about saving that 135 extra dollars. Also, people stop burning your sneakers..... they already paid the little kid in the sweat shop and made their profit.",0.9992

They missed the already low estimate by a lot which may not be a huge deal because of the virus and all the people staying home. But how are they in better shape than they were at the beginning of the year? And how are they 22% better than 6/25/19 when the virus didn't exist? I would say there's uncertainty about when they will completely recover and have the same revenues as before the crisis. It could be quick, perhaps by the end of the year, but that is not a certainty. If this drags on and unemployment remains high those people that buy Nike products may just opt for cheaper shoes. I haven't bought shoes for my kids, who usually go through shoes quickly, for months because they don't leave the house much and it looks like school in the Fall will include remote learning. My job has shifted to work from home going forward so I will need less shoes and apparel.This could be just a blip on the radar but I can't see any reason why Nike is better off than they were one year ago and 22% is a huge advance from the price of the stock one year ago.",0.9955

James, guest writerSaturday, September 8, 2018(NEW FRONTIER NEWS)- When Nike chose Colin Kaepernick as their new spokesman, the company engaged in an impressive publicity and public relations strategy, but their choice ultimately may become a devastating blow to their business.At first, glance, choosing Kaepernick seems like a noble and applause-worthy idea.A significant number of African-Americans, many millennials, and lots of others applaud this call because it appears that Nike is supporting a person standing up for what he believes.Yet the reality also is that Nike gets millions of dollars’ worth of free publicity by making this controversial choice.

4008,"""The Bad Stuff That the Stock Market Worried About Is Starting to Happen""For the first time during Donald Trump’s presidency, both economic statistics and sentiment indicators are missing analysts’ expectations. So-called hard data includes government and private-sector data on consumer spending, jobs, manufacturing and housing, while the soft stats looks to Fed factory surveys and consumer confidence polls.Anything that suggests cracks in the earnings and macro foundation would go down poorly on Wall Street. That’s what was happening Thursday, as Apple’s outlook clouded profit forecasts at everything from semiconductor suppliers to electronics retailers, and the Institute for Supply Management index miss spurred speculation the economy isn’t doing as well as hoped.For investors trying to read the tea leaves, two risks exist. One, that the market saw something the professional prognosticators didn’t. And two, that the losses piling up in financial markets become a kind of self-fulfilling prophesy, denting sentiment and impairing consumer and business confidence.“It’s psychology of the market, which now is that growth is slowing and it almost feeds on itself,” Laurence Benedict, founder of Opportunistic Trader, said in a phone interview. “Businesses don’t want to spend because we potentially are going into a recession.

What I do know is, he gained popularity and magazine covers he likely wouldn’t have gotten without getting on his knees or as you say, “believing in something.” I’m also thinking the irony is that while I am not privy to the numbers, it’s likely he gained a lucrative Nike contract.

4586,"Does anyone see a pattern with this company. All you can do is not financially support the politics of this progressive pandering company. They seem to do fine after controversy, but as a former retired corporate guy I am surprised by their constant entry into the dark side. Companies on entities designed to one thing, to generate a product, sell that product, be better than anyone else making a comparable product, in order to create profits for the stockholders. Its pretty simple. Why would a company become so socially progressive that they alienate a big portion of a potential market. I would not think this to be in the best interest of the stockholders. Companies should be neutral on social issues. I also do not understand why Kaepernick, if he truly is their public face, does not review products before they hit the market, to make sure it is in line with his perspective. Personally the Betsy Ross Flag, represents a time as early at 1777, long before NIke or Kaepernick, and had the circle of 13 stars as I understand to represent the original 13 colonies bound together by the unity of a circle. I do not think Betsy or anyone else thought it was racist or discriminatory. Oddly enough if Nike wants to get on the topic of slavery, they should look in their own yard. They have their product made for pennies in slave like conditions in foreign countries. I really do not buy their sense of righteous indignation to be legitimate.",0.9925

Your new ad with Colin Kapernick, I get the message, but that sacrificing everything thing…. It just doesn’t play out here. Sacrificing what exactly? A career? I’ve done that both times I chose to stay home and be with my kids instead of continuing my business climb… and it wasn’t sacrificing everything. It was sacrificing one career and some money and it was because of what I believe in and more importantly, who I believe in.At best, that is all Colin sacrificed … some money and it’s debatable if he really lost his career over it. Maybe he sacrificed the respect of some people while he gained the respect of others. Or maybe he used one career to springboard himself into a different career when the first was waning. I don’t know. What I do know is, he gained popularity and magazine covers he likely wouldn’t have gotten without getting on his knees or as you say, “believing in something.” I’m also thinking the irony is that while I am not privy to the numbers, it’s likely he gained a lucrative Nike contract. So yeah… that whole “sacrificing everything” is insulting to those who really have sacrificed everything.You want to talk about someone in the NFL sacrificing everything? Pat Tillman. NFL STARTING, not benched, player who left to join the Army and died for it. THAT is sacrificing everything for something you believe in.How about other warriors? Warriors who will not be on magazine covers, who will not get lucrative contracts and millions of followers from their actions and who have truly sacrificed everything. They did it because they believed in something. Take it from me, when I say they sacrificed everything, they also sacrificed the lives of their loved ones who will never be the same. THAT is sacrificing everything for something they believe in.Did you get us talking? Yeah, you did. But, your brand recognition was strong enough. Did you teach the next generation of consumers about true grit? Not that I can see.Taking a stand, or rather a knee, against the flag which has covered the caskets of so many who actually did sacrifice everything for something they believe in, that we all believe in? Well, the irony of your ad..it almost leaves me speechless. Were you trying to be insulting?Maybe you are banking on the fact we won’t take the time to see your lack of judgement in using words that just don’t fit. Maybe you are also banking on us not seeing Nike as kneeling before the flag. Or maybe you want us to see you exactly that way. I don’t know. All I know is, I was actually in the market for some new kicks and at least for now, I’ve never been more grateful for Under Armour.",0.9987

That might be true, but I do not personally believe in the long run it will pay dividends to the shareholders. As a shareholder, I feel betrayed by this decision. I don't care about the whole thing with CK in regard to investing.
