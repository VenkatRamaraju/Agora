Or if there is a dip in the stock maybe buy them back lower for a nice return.Absolute worst case is DVA takes a dive and is below 60 on OE and you have just lowered your 60.00 cost basis by roughly 10.00 which still looks good.No choice on getting Dialysis and it's basically still a duopoly.,0.7024

76,Just on CNBC Jim Chanos(sp?) shorting DVA for Years and questions Berkshire being involved - they still have 24%.A couple comments. Berkshire doesn't ALWAYS make the best moves. Look at the first time that I know of that they bought a Company with another investor(who is slash n loot) from Brazil with Kraft Heinz. You can see what a mis-step that was.And actually it was Warren's 2 new hires that both had bought DVA that they had to file 10% ownership not long after they had started.Now DVA is at 24% and I believe have a standstill agreement. Which is why I questioned DVA announced a significant buyback not long ago which would increase Berkshire's % ad if that would cause any issues.I am long DVA(common and I had sold some common and bought deep in the money calls that are now up 59%.It will be interesting to hear why it is shorted. We already know that all profits come from the little sliver of private pay for Davita and Frenesius.Capital intensive but a necessary service. And since to me it has a lot of characteristics of a Utility I have always thought they should have a dividend.Let the games begin. I have made decent money trading DVA over Years. Virtually all the common and calls I own are with the House's money.I had wanted this to be one of my 4 largest holdings but it just can't seem to get there!2 folks with WAY more money and information that I will lever have. Time to grab the popcorn and decide if there is an opportunity to make money here.And I have been long BRKB's for a very long time.

Being a crazy market I have been buying calls into the new Year more than common as a way to limit risk.Time will tell about the market, and this ""risk less"" but more like gambling(mostly due to time limitation) than true investing to me.I still have a little over 12% cash left.DVA like several stocks I own and follow I have to believe tax loss selling is a large part of the slide. Folks figuring DVA certainly isn't going to go out of Business so it's being oversold for accounting purposes and likely to be bought back.As long as Berkshire isn't selling (the 2 new guys are who bought DVA) and folks need Dialysis I can't see DVA going anywhere.If DVA paid a dividend(and why don't they - as to me almost a utility stock) it wouldn't have gotten beaten up this bad.

If it doesn't get called away I've just reduced my cost basis. Often when I do this if I can buy the calls back at half the price I collected I buy them back and close out the trade, usually has to do with how much time is left.But 20% in a Year or a lowered cost basis is looking pretty good.Also look at a simple chart for the past Year. Between 65 and 69 that's getting kinda close to the recent high's and I'd likely be selling some of my trading shares in that range anyways.Good luck folks!",0.9876

338,"By this morning I have purchased back most of the DVA I sold earlier, and added a little more SQ.Watching SPY, KLIC, JPM to add.Got lucky with DVA in one account it's been excellent trading especially considering that I really view DVA as a long term hold.5/19/18 bought small lot 64.7511/7/18 sold 4 lots 75.5511/8/18 bought lot 69.7511/13/18 bought lot 65.4612/10/18 bought lot 57.53(10% lower than last buy)In another account I have similar1/11/18 sold 4 lots 78.68bought lot 5/3/18 63.53so I may have more buying to do to finish replacement. Been looking at calls alsoTax loss selling HAS to be an issue as this market continues to deteriorate rapidly.3rd account a couple of lots from March 2017 avg 68 I added a lot 11/20 59.53.I'm now at about 10% of my Portfolio and overall the shares I hold are down 8%. Now I have booked decent profits though this doesn't reflect.In the end I always wondered why DVA doesn't pay a dividend. Huge cash flow, almost a utility. No choice but to have Dialysis and basically it's a duopoly. WEB's new guys both loved DVA and I sold some when Berkshire had to file how much DVA they owned and other folks jumped in.Basically Tarif's won't effect DVA. Taxes won't negatively effect DVA.No choice but to have Dialysis if you need it.Tax loss selling has to be a major factor IMO right now.""Scale in, scale out, online commissions are cheap""Good luck folks!",0.9844

343,"Added some at 54.53 in very rare for em pre-market buy on news about at-home DialysisRemember that Frenesius(sp?) just was allowed to complete their purchase of NXTM that has to my knowledge still the only small at home unit for Dialysis including overnight.I used to own NXTM - a decent amount until I saw the moves mgmt was making to continue their personal gravy train at the expense of stock holders. By the time the buyout came I didn't own many shares. Infact one of the worst moved NXTM had made was giving away too much of the company and a board seat to the fella they bought the tubing set business off of and is what they had to sell off to have the buyout be allowed.If DVA continues to slide I'll hope to buy back my Jan 65 calls that I wrote for half price and likely will still add some common.There are always stories and sometimes referendum's abotu Dialysis. But there still arent' many altrernatives to Dialysis or the 2 large Company's in this space.Good luck folks!""scale in, scale out, online commissions are cheap""I may flip today's pre-market shares for a couple bucks more today given the chance.",0.9634
