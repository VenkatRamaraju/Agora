111,"Even though nearly 40 percent of American adults have received the COVID-19 vaccine, COVID-19 cases across the country have been skyrocketing in the past month. The surge in cases has cast a dark pallor over the positive news on vaccinations, suggesting that a great number of Americans have prematurely cast caution to the wind. Yet it seems that the vaccinations may finally be catching up to the virus. Newly updated data from this week shows that coronavirus cases are not increasing linearly or exponentially, as they have in previous surges. Experts believe the COVID-19 case load in the country is following the downward curvature that signifies we've hit an inflection point — giving public health officials and experts alike hope that the worst of the pandemic is truly over.In a Tuesday briefing, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Dr. Rochelle Walenski noted that over the past seven days, new cases, hospitalizations and daily deaths all went down. Specifically, new infections fell by 21 percent over the past week, prompting Walensky to call the trend ""a really hopeful decline."" Even cases in states like Michigan, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota— which were leading the surge in the U.S. last week — are down.""I hope this message is encouraging for you,"" Walensky said. ""It shows just how powerful these vaccines are in our efforts to end this pandemic and why we are asking everyone to roll up their sleeves and get vaccinated.""Walensky's tone was starkly different from a separate press briefing a few weeks ago, in which she warned of ""impending doom.""The sudden downward trend has many wondering if the U.S. has reached a turning point where enough of the population is vaccinated to slow down the rate of transmission. If that's the case, that means that as more people get vaccinated, the decline may be slow and steady.""I keep on thinking of this picture on getting to herd immunity,"" Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease doctor and professor of medicine at the University of California–San Francisco, told Salon. ""These sheep turn pink every time they're vaccinated, and there are fewer and fewer white sheep that are unvaccinated next to each other, and then the virus can't spread because it can't spread among the pink sheep.""Want more health and science stories in your inbox? Subscribe to Salon's weekly newsletter The Vulgar Scientist.Gandhi said she suspects this is what happened in Israel, which she looks to as an example of how mass vaccination can end the pandemic. Indeed, last week, Israel recorded zero new daily COVID-19 deaths for the first time in 10 months. About 54% of the Israeli population is now fully vaccinated, and the rate of positive virus tests has dropped to 0.2%, according to the Times of Israel; meanwhile, the virus regeneration number, which indicates how many more people are infected for each infected person, has dropped to 0.75 — meaning the virus will eventually go extinct if trends continue. Yet it wasn't easy to reach this point. In January, COVID-19 cases in Israel surged, despite one-fifth of the country's population being vaccinated. That prompted a renewed lockdown. Amid the surge, the country opened vaccination eligibility to everyone over 16 at the beginning of February. Over the next month, cases fell low enough for the country to reopen on March 7. To date, people in Israel continue to gather freely, and for the first time cases aren't rising despite an ease in restrictions. Israel's example reveals that vaccinating the majority of the population is key to ending the pandemic.Gandhi hopes that Israel's experience foreshadows what will come in the United States. She noted that cases in Israel started to fall when 40 percent of the population received at least the first dose of the vaccine, and says that the same trend is occurring in the United States. However, she cautioned there are some caveats — like a population's herd immunity — that could affect at what percentage of vaccinations does a country reach its inflection point.""The nuance is that every place has a different level of natural immunity based on their surges,"" Gandhi said. ""And so if you have natural immunity in your population, then you likely reach that inflection point sooner.""According to the CDC vaccine tracker, at least 42.7% of the U.S. population has now received the first dose of a vaccine; 29.1 percent of the population is fully vaccinated.""And then what's the next number that makes it so you almost get rid of it?"" Gandhi asked. ""I don't know what that is, but my estimation is somewhere between 65 and 70 percent.""Over the last year, cases have risen and fallen; the United States has struggled to reach a point of steady decline. Gandhi said this time is different because the fall in COVID-19 cases runs parallel to the increase in vaccinations; credit is also owed to the effectiveness of the vaccines.""Tbio is confirmed next Moderna, 35 point pop",0.9959

The deception started right from the beginning sadly.NKLA = The company that had to admit that their big tech reveal never existed and instead they pushed a truck with no engine down a slanted hill... This is why we make the jokes about gravity on this sub.NKLA = The founder and others got forced out because of misleading the media and investors and first ghosted on all social media and then deleted all social media.NKLA = Came out as a company and agreed they mislead people.NKLA = The company was stacked with the founders friend and family who had no experience or expertise in hydrogen. The literal brother of the founder was put in charge of the hydrogen development part of the business despite doing basic home repairs and laying concrete his whole life.... It is why we make the jokes about concrete on this sub....NKLA = Many times offered literal cash and free stock to companies like GM and others. None of these companies accepted because the cost of doing business with a fraudulent company was not worth it. Additionally most companies have came out and said NKLA has nothing to offer regardless. At this point they are spending your shareholder money doing back yard amateur projects. If you believe in the EV market or even more precisely hydrogen there are a lot of places doing actual research and work and not just blowing shareholder money to pay their inflated salaries.NKLA = Has investigations by both the SEC and DOJ. That means Security Exchange Commission and Department of Justice...NKLA = Numerous class action lawsuits for misleading investors and mis-spending shareholder money.The list literally goes on for pages but I have kept it semi concise to help a lot of you out. This company is literally going to bankruptcy or delisting. Every major analyst and firm has stated this.

That sounds totally meaningless and should not have any impact on PPS except the psychological drama shorts are going to spreading using the word ""dilution"". The question is, why? We recently saw that Nikola is likely not going to go with one big partner for hydrogen but more likely will make small deals like AZ Utility in various regions. Nel and Hanwha will provide the electrolyzers and solar equipment and Nikola will build the hydrogen stations solo (likely) and that means all the revenue will go to Nikola (no revenue sharing).

2012,A simple message to leave you on for the weekend. If you come to yahoo finance discussion boards in order to pump this stock because you are desperate to see it rise that is your answer. That is your answer to get out. To take the loss. I know it is hard for a lot of you but it is better than losing everything.,0.4708
2013,"Watching people desperately trying to mislead individuals on yahoo finance forums is pathetic. In fact I would say it's embarrassing. You are not going to pump a ""company"" associated with fraud that no reputable business wants to deal with on here... Here is the simple truth so people can cut through the clutter. NKLA is falling because the mania of the market is wearing off in particular EV. It is why it spiked in the first place... It had terrible fundamentals, ended up being deep into misleading investors/fraud, family and friend cronyism throughout the company, etc.It is falling below IPO price because now the market knows that all the things that were ""expected"" or ""excited about"" don't exist and the company now has a dark cloud over it. So the original value is no longer there. It is not as complex as all these desperate gamblers want to make it. If you want to invest in the EV sphere or hydrogen development in particular you have so many great companies to pick from. Don't shackle yourself to a ""company"" that has so much fraud and problems. This is business and suppose to be about logic and clear reasoning. Not emotional baggage and cult like kool-aid. For those trying to pump this (hopelessly I may add) in order to sucker individuals in so you can unload you are doing some pretty horrible stuff and that should be your note to just sell and let go. We have been saying it would go back to IPO since the height, you choose to ignore just common fundamentals and common sense. We explained why it would go below SPAC/IPO listing price. It did. And now most knowledgeable people say regardless of bounces or this or that within a year or two it will be bankrupt and or delisted. If you want to put your hard earned money into a company associated with fraud and deception and trust people that have literally been wrong over and over every single time for going on 6+ months then I guess by all means be that foolish. If you want to make some money the market still has some incredible equities and places for profit :) Best of luck :)",0.121

The US Company valuations DO NOT MAKE Sense at all! Why would one invest in US Stock Tulip Mania while he/she can buy the 1000 times better company share for a 99% cheaper price? The US Stock Market is a MAJOR PONZI SCHEME designed to patch fraudulent pension systems in the US temporarily! There is NO PROPER Revenue Collection by the IRS since 2016. Taxes are extremely Low, and Nobody is paying custom duties! People want more free money without working, more free checks, more capital gains, more stock hypes every day! This fraudulent ""no need to work"" policy of the US Government will END TERRIBLY very soon! Inflation is skyrocketing, but the Government is lying about inflation! $AMD $NVDA $AMZN $AAPL $SQ $SHOP $SNAP $TWLO $CRM $ROKU $ADBE $DB $BAC $JPM $MS $GS $TWTR $TSLA $IBM $INTC $MSFT $GOOG $LMT $BA $TXN $NXPI $LRCX $NKE $DIS $EBAY $X $MA $V $S $T $F $GM $NFLX $CSCO $CAT $MMM $SBUX $TGT $WMT $ATVI $EA $TTWO $MCD $AVGO $JNJ $BIDU $BZUN $BABA $MU $AMAT $QCOM $WFC $BBBY $PFE $GE $WDC $BLK $KO $UA $ABBV $GILD $BB $ORCL $RH $KEM $IQ $GRPN $PYPL $MA $MOMO $JD $WBA $CVS $FB $W $BBY $SKX $FL $EFX $ETSY $W $UNH $SAP $GPRO $KHC $DPZ $PEP $LYFT $UBER $BYND $ZM $OLED $XOM $CVX $DAL $UAL $AAL $LUV $SAVE $AXP $SPCE $NCLH $CCL $NKLA $NIO $ZM $XPEV $QS",-0.9045

So, if you think Monday is pump and dump, you must look at GME chart. It went from $10s to almost $500. Now look at where it is today. about $200. HCMC is 0.0018 today. If the movement takes it up to $2 in a week, trust me you will never see it at 0.5 Dollars. So get in as soon as you can with the money you can afford to spend on Monday.

And we do share a goal to have regular deliveries being made on a pilot basis by the end of 2021 with Anheuser Busch, and so we're working on that very diligently.

I will help fill in the blanks because I honestly feel sorry for a lot of you that are new to ""investing"".NKLA = Started by a guy that has multiple lawsuits against him for starting and selling businesses using misleading information.NKLA = They chose the name in order to get people that thought they missed the boat on investing in Tesla. The deception started right from the beginning sadly.NKLA = The company that had to admit that their big tech reveal never existed and instead they pushed a truck with no engine down a slanted hill... This is why we make the jokes about gravity on this sub.NKLA = The founder and others got forced out because of misleading the media and investors and first ghosted on all social media and then deleted all social media.NKLA = Came out as a company and agreed they mislead people.NKLA = The company was stacked with the founders friend and family who had no experience or expertise in hydrogen. The literal brother of the founder was put in charge of the hydrogen development part of the business despite doing basic home repairs and laying concrete his whole life.... It is why we make the jokes about concrete on this sub....NKLA = Many times offered literal cash and free stock to companies like GM and others. None of these companies accepted because the cost of doing business with a fraudulent company was not worth it. Additionally most companies have came out and said NKLA has nothing to offer regardless. At this point they are spending your shareholder money doing back yard amateur projects. If you believe in the EV market or even more precisely hydrogen there are a lot of places doing actual research and work and not just blowing shareholder money to pay their inflated salaries.NKLA = Has investigations by both the SEC and DOJ. That means Security Exchange Commission and Department of Justice...NKLA = Numerous class action lawsuits for misleading investors and mis-spending shareholder money.The list literally goes on for pages but I have kept it semi concise to help a lot of you out. This company is literally going to bankruptcy or delisting. Every major analyst and firm has stated this. No one wants to touch this company with a 10 foot poll due to the stains of corruption and fraud.
