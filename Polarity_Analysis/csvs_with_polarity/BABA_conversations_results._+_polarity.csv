19,"Although the article of Reuters is denied by ANT (on Twitter), even if it was true I think it won’t affect stock price of Alibaba in a negative way. First of all around the planned IPO, ANT,s value was estimated at 300 billion and Alibaba has 33% of shares (so 100 billion in value). Since the ANT cancellation until now, Alibaba has lost 200 billion in enterprise value (with stock markets at fresh records). ANT value has declined but certainly not to zero, so the market is clearly overreacting. The fine is settled now and only considered 2,8 billion, this creates certainty for us shareholders. Furthermore, a forced divestment of Jack Ma from ANT is painfull for him (I feel sorry that he is pressured this much by the CCP, it feels unfair) but does not directly involves the stake of Alibaba. Off course clarity about ANT would be more then welcome and clearly the CCP and ANT are looking for options, but I think this could take a little longer. Just make sure not to sell by al these uncertainties, Alibaba stock price is already reduced twice the complete value of ANT (overreacted) and since the fine there is a little bit more clarity. My advice would be to sit tight, China won’t kill it’s own diamonds, only wants them to listen a bit more which they made clear already. They now seem to prioritise to settle things quickly/this year and this will benefit Alibaba in the medium term IMHO. Good luck and Alibaba is a Pearl that will shine one day, just make sure you hold your shares tight.",0.9972

46,"We look for Alibaba to have an extremely strong calendar 2020 year-end into early 2021, driven by two main events. First is Global Shopping Festival, Alibaba’s major shopping bonanza that typically takes place on November 11 and was formerly called Single’s Day. For 2020, Global Shopping Festival has been split into a three-day pre-launch period (11/1/20 to 11/3/20) and Single’s Day itself on 11/11/20. Shoppers can use the interim period to cue up their purchases on the main day. In 2019, Singles GMV surpassed 213.5 trillion yuan ($30.5 billion) in GMV; the expanded format in calendar 2020 will likely result in extremely strong growth in GMV vs. last year’s one-day event.In February, China will get to celebrate Lunar New Year much as it has traditionally been celebrated with family meetings and gifts. Early in 2020, the pandemic hit China full force during Lunar New Year, resulting in stranded workers, cancelled celebrations, and muted gift-giving. We look for an exaggerated ‘make-up’ Lunar New Year celebration in China.",0.9894

[2] The Narso MAA application, to the EMA, should be submitted by June, and approval from the EU may very well come by year end. [3] Very good chance we see some I-SPY Covid results by June, and those results could be best in class. [4] OMS 906 phase 1 results should be out by Sept. A once monthly subcutaneous complement pathway drug, as a follow-on to Narso, would enhance our buyout value tremendously. [5] IGaN trial enrollment greatly delayed by Covid (N=280), so likely no results until late Q1, 2022. [6] Once approval is in hand, for TMAs, a substantial capx raise, north of $30/share, should take place, enabling a full phase 2/3 Narso trial in Lupus. [7] I was surprised by Greg's emphasis on GPR174 for cancer, and am hopeful we see an IND, by July. A broad based onco therapy, highly synergistic with many types of cancer treatments, might be worth five times the current MC, by itself.

A settlement was reached between Alipay and Alibaba where it was decided that Alibaba will get 37.5% of Alipay's pre-tax profit. It was really a bad deal for Alibaba shareholders ( through their proxy companies like Yahoo or Softbank since Alibaba was still private). That spinoff now became the world's most valuable private company. Before the IPO, Ant Group exchanged a 33% stake to Alibaba in lieu of the 37.5% pre-tax profits.When the Reuters rumour ( I call it a rumor since Reuters also claimed that ANT was selling the 30% paytm stake in india - a claim denied by ANT and still holds true since ANT did NOT sell any stake in paytm) was released today morning, it was a dejavu moment if only it was true - if Jack Ma was made to divest his majority stake back to Alibaba who was the rightful owner of that stake in the first place. ( google search ""alipay group spinoff alibaba 2011"" for news articles about this).The good thing to look at this news article is that all parties want to come to a conclusion soon. If it means selling stake back to Alibaba, that would be great for Alibaba's investors since we will be getting a major portion of ANT pre-IPO. If it goes to someone else, the loss is not ours either - ANT IPO will bring us increased valuation.There are other negative news articles that were released since yesterday - signs of desperation by hedge funds out there trying their best to shake off retail investors into selling their shares. Their desperation is very clearly visible since their urgency in releasing simultaneous news articles can only point to the fact that there are not many sellers in the low volume days since Monday and any news about settlement of ANT IPO will make the stock go back to where it belongs ( based on technical forward P/E estimation)Hang in there and you will see 300's soon !",0.9972

Buffett started buying so much shares as he could; he knew that the stock market price was really lower than the real worth of the company. The stock price of WP dropped almost 30% in the following months, and Buffett kept his conviction. In the following 3 years was in red. BUt then, the market started paying attention to the WP, and it end up becoming one of Buffett's best investments (a 10 bagger!). We dont forget, that Munger agreed with Buffett about the moat of the Washington Post, and both were right. Now, Munger has invested in BABA, not in Alphabet, not in Facebook, not in Tesla, just in BABA among the big tech companies. Munger is not a guy who just buy a company with a discounted price, he really wants to buy a extraordinary business at a adequate price. My suggestion, is dont worry about your investment in BABA, focus on other stocks in your portfolio, BABA will florish at some point, and everybody who is patient will be extremely rewarded in the long haul, probably, a stock that will change many lives..",0.9974

OTOH, whatever bullseye Ma may have had on his back has been hit so many times Xi may finally be lighting up.

602,"For those of you who still don't understand the impact of Charlie Munger's 40 million investment into BABA, take this into perspective: Charlie Munger invested $15 million in Wells Fargo and Bank Of America in 2009. WF Average price was $8, and his reasoning was ""We bought Wells Fargo & Co. stock when it was at $8, and I don’t think we will have another opportunity like that."". Since 2009, the total dividend paid by WF is about $14, and the stock is worth close to $40 now. His other holdings through Daily Journal are made when the stock was very cheap. Charlie Munger coming into BABA at 270, averaging it all the way to 245 with purchases when the SP went down clearly shows how undervalued he thinks of this stock. I am not sure if he stopped buying yet, since the SP is still below his average price and he could as well be adding more at this price. Al Gore's Generation Investment Management also purchased 1,544,863 shares of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), giving the stake 1.6% weight in its equity portfolio. Shares averaged $227.43 during the fourth quarter.Let's see if Berkshire Hathaway also purchased BABA during this quarter. BABA still does not give out dividends, but maybe it is time they do to attract other investors like Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet.

Their push to become a PAAS cloud provider in China continues to gain traction (ebita positive) with Chinese enterprises and SMBs, and is likely to reap big rewards over the next few years. Their main cloud offering s like a Workday+Microsoft amalgamation (less office 365) that has proven to be sticky especially because of DingDing (Dingtalk). If the government follows through with strict anti-monopoly laws (subsidies), then their main competitor Tencent will no longer be allowed to provide heavily subsidised cloud services, and we should see increased profit margins to the 40+% growth in revenue over the next 5 years. Based on this growth trajectory, the cloud business is likely to become the size of today's local commerce business segment in 2026. I'm conservatively predicting $25M in revenue and 20% Ebitda. You do the math on what the stock price will be then.To back my prediction up are a few factors:1. Nascent Chinese cloud penetration currently 1/8th of the US. 2. Aligned with the biz strategy. Daniel Zhang has mentioned in interviews that he sees the cloud business becoming bigger than commerce.3. AWS's growth trajectory but reserved for Chinese companies in a shielded Chinese Market4. Decoupling of US - China tech. Chinese companies and potentially some foreign companies will likely find it beneficial to use Chinese cloud services at least for China operations5. Economies of scale from continued massive investment ($30B over 3 years on hardware, software and heartware) There is a risk that BABA might become too big and successful in the longer term.

If Xi Jinping thinks BABA is a serious risk to his control of the country, BABA will go bankrupt in a couple of weeks. In fact, it is known that BABA has close ties with Jiang Zemin who is Xi’s political enemy. (2) Shrinking Chinese population. Chinese government has been delaying the release of once-a-decade census results more than a month, which could indicate they are cooking the numbers. If their population has been shrinking as fast as many people are suspecting, BABA won’t have the opportunity to grow.Buffet once said not to follow big names in stock investing w/o DD, and I know of numerous cases in which you would loose money if you followed either Buffet or Monger.",0.3034

I then added NFLX LEAPS in fall 2012 and huge positions in NVDA and AMD (sh and calls in 2016). The result lead to me being a multimillionaire at a relatively young age. Now, the only stocks I own are AAPL and BABA (just started buying BABA this week). I am 84% in cash and will look to further invest in BABA and Tencent.

A forward p/e of <20 for a growth stock is incredible (even in an undervalued market, it's still a good buy). Valuations are only going to go so low.

872,"Dear Alibaba merchants, consumers, partners and shareholders,Today Alibaba Group received the Administrative Penalty Decision issued by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) of the People's Republic of China. We accept the penalty with sincerity and will ensure our compliance with determination. On this occasion, the entire team at Alibaba would like to express our gratitude to the trust and patience that our merchants, consumers, partners and shareholders have given us. We would like to share our thoughts and plans for the long-term healthy development of our business in the future.Over the past several months, we fully cooperated with the SAMR investigation and seriously studied the government's policies and expectations for Internet platform economies. In this connection, we conducted a self-assessment of, and implemented improvements to, our internal systems while ensuring stable operation of our business. The penalty issued today served to alert and catalyze companies like ours. It reflects the regulators' thoughtful and normative expectations toward our industry's development. It is an important action to safeguard fair market competition and quality development of Internet platform economies.Internet platform economies are new economic structures created out of the latest cycle of technological revolution. Because of China's economic and technology development, as well as regulatory support for innovation, Alibaba has been given the opportunity to explore and create platform business models such as Taobao and Tmall with the help of millions of small- and medium-sized merchants and hundreds of millions of consumers. The platform model lowered the costs of starting and doing business, improved efficiency and enhanced circulation of economic activities. Today, Internet platform economies have entered an entirely new phase. They are an integral part of people's everyday life and affect all dimensions of the broader economy. It is not lost on us that today's society has new expectations for platform companies, as we must assume more responsibilities as part of the nation's economic and social development. At the same time, we are cognizant that the value of platforms comes from helping participants to succeed through integrating and sharing resources, as well as continuously creating value for society.We are acutely aware that our livelihood depends on keeping up with the times and our nation's development; continuously listening, understanding and servicing our countless merchants and consumers; and being steadfast in pursuing technological innovation. We will further strengthen our focus on customer value creation and customer experience, as well as continuing to introduce measures to lower entry barriers and business costs of operating on our platforms. We are committed to ensuring an operating environment for our merchants and partners that is more open, more equitable, more efficient and more inclusive in sharing the fruits of growth.Today is an important day in Alibaba's journey of growth. It is a new starting point for us, one where we tackle problems head on and commit to innovate. Alibaba would not have achieved our growth without sound government regulation and service, and the critical oversight, tolerance and support from all of our constituencies have been crucial to our development. For this, we are full of gratitude and respect. We started Alibaba because we believe in treating customers first and creating sustainable long-term value for society. These are our reasons for being, to which we are fully committed, and from which we will never waver.Alibaba Group2021.4.10",0.9991

1204,"With Thurday’s ER the stock will be trading around 20 P/E which is a bargain for a company that is so dominant in its space and keep growing in different sectors. One thing to look for should be the Cloud business. Alibaba currently holds the biggest market share in Cloud business in China and as we know from US, this sector will grow more and more in China as well. I look forward seeing the revenues for this quarter. I can list why I am so bullish for BABA below:- Growth of the company YoY has been so bealthy, especially the profit margins are extremely good compared to other mega cap names.- Ant IPO will come into play at some point. I expect it to be by the end of this year. Once that happens, all the uncertainty on this stock will be over and institutions will feel more comfortable buying BABA (although a lot of them been adding BABA to their portfolio recently).- Growth of China and the big potential of Asia market. I personally believe that the Chinese economy will surpass US within next 10 years. And I see it as the inevitable end. With this economic growth and increase in demand for e-commerce in China, Alibaba will retain his dominance in this space, growing their revenues even more year by year.You should have a long term mindset for this stock. If you want to make quick money you shouldn’t really be in this stock. Maybe try playing with option market instead. For me this is a 3-5 year hold and it is a stress free hold as the numbers don’t lie. This is one of the healthiest businesses out there with a very reasonable price.

Most of these bearish analysts say that the delisting issue is critical, other ones say that the delisting issue is not critical but the current regulation inside China is the critical issue, other ones say that the competition from PDD and JD is a threat. Apparently, these guys dont know what are the competitive advantages of Alibaba, they dont know how the regulations are not really impacting Alibaba's business model, they dont know what are the core values of Alibaba that make it well prepared to embrace any change in the market conditions, they just write about this company without making an effort to go beyond the news, because that's what an analyst must do. It's really hard for any competitor in China to actually compete agaisnt Alibaba, knowing that this company was made since its inception to compete. Alibaba innovates continuously, offering more and more innovating services to its active users, if its market in China is decelerating, its market is South East Asia is still in a early stage; its cloud business is going like a rocket, its other promissing businesses will be a reality at some point and Ant is advancing to adapt itself to the new regulations, reaching agreements with commercial banks in China to increase its fees which will compensate the higher capital requirements, so Ant is advancing in its process of its future IPO. Combining all of these, with the fact that the government of China really dont have the incentives to weaken Alibaba's position because it is one of its weapons to fulfill its own goals to expand Chinesse operations in the world, particularly in Asia. Im sure Munger saw all of these plus other information that he is managing to put money in this company. I am sure these bearish analysts are waiting for a better environment for Alibaba, but then, the price would be more than 350$, and then they will say that you should buy!.

Now that BABA has this prior pending issue behind it is a better position than Google was when it was fined double that of BABA and paid to a foreign entity. In my view BABA has and continues to be extremely undervalued, so is l now be the time for the investors to buy? Mr. Charlie Munger (vice president of Berkshire Hathaway) disclose he thinks so with his $37.5 million investment in BABA as of March 31. BABA's current shareholders and potential investors may now be in line with that the share price will now reverse to the upside as it has now the ability to regain momentum throughout the markets to align its share price with its competitors that have always had a smaller footprint and revenue stream. What may be required from BABA is to better inform the market on how it will now focus on making the long term investor some solid returns over the next few quarters and gain the trust of potential investors it will only go up from its 52 weeks high of 319+ when it regains it and that it will continue to go vertical from there.In the long run for BABA despite the fine, can finally move past it and China was the ultimate beneficiary of the $2.7 billion dollars it will get in return. The share price may have a pullback or it might go up from here knowingly that the Ant Finacial IPO may soon be announced to be in play for some time this year, which BABA would make up for the fine paid within minutes or hours and then some if it were to occur, and every BABA investor should be rewarded too.",0.9976

1646,"To BABA investors: the latest months could be hard for some, but every big companies, all the FAANG have been in the same situation before everybody realized that they were real cash cow. If you invested in AAPL in 2012 at 24$, you were truly disappointed in 2013 when it fell to 16$ or 33%, but if you were confident enough that the earnings would continue to grow for the next decade, you are now holding shares 6x (127$/share right now) your initial investment in 2012, which is not so bad. Here is the same with a company that look ready to grow as much as Apple for the next decades sss(at least 2). And when the the market will be saturated, they will slow down there investment and start buying more shares, which will contribute to continue there ascent, just like Apple again. I think BABA is a 10x bagger if you stay for the next 20 years. Plus, you got that cash cow, with massive moat in a country with almost 5x US population and technology growth at a ridiculous price (comparable to an oil company). China CCP is not only bad, it also avoid other companies to get in the country, which is a really good news considering that BABA is the biggest play in China right now. You maybe bought BABA at 310$, but you can still sell it more than 3000$ in 20 years, or 1000$ in 10 years. Cloud, retail, grocery, entertainment, autonomous, EV, find the best way to make money and BABA is already doing it in a country growing faster than all the world!

It is an effective standard for illegal activities of platform companies. It does not mean denying the important role of the platform economy in the overall economic and social development.

2027,"Few positive points though positive thing Aldo is they are working on clearing the way: The company hoped Ma's stake, which is worth billions of dollars, could be sold to existing investors in Ant or its e-commerce affiliate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd without involving any external entity, one of the sources with company ties said.But the second source also with company connections said that during discussions with regulators, Ma was told that he would not be allowed to sell his stake to any entity or individual close to him, and would instead have to exit completely. Another option would be to transfer his stake to a Chinese investor affiliated with the state, the source said.Any move would need Beijing's approval, both sources with knowledge of the company's thinking said.The accounts provided by all the three sources are consistent in terms of the timeline for how discussions have evolved over the past few months. On the company side, one source said Ma met regulators more than once before the Chinese New Year, which was in early February. And the second source said Ant started working on options for Ma's possible exit about a couple of months ago. The source familiar with the regulators' thinking said Ant had told officials during a meeting sometime before mid-March that it was working on options.The source familiar with the regulators' thinking has direct knowledge of conversations between Ant and officials, while one of the sources with company ties has been briefed on Ma's interactions with regulators and Ant's plans. The other one has direct knowledge of Ant's discussions about options. They requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.The Ant spokesman did not provide any comments from Ma. Alibaba referred questions to Ant. Jack Ma's office did not respond to Reuters' request for comment made via Ant. The State Council Information Office, PBOC, and CBIRC, also did not respond to requests for comment.The high-stakes discussions come amid a revamp of Ant and a broader regulatory clampdown on China's technology sector that was set in motion after Ma's public criticism of regulators in a speech in October last year.Another positive: Ma's exit could help clear the way for Ant to revive plans to go public, which stalled after the tycoon's speech, both sources proximate to the company said. Ant, which was about to raise an estimated $37 billion in what would have been the world's largest initial public offering, aborted plans the day after Ma's Nov. 2 meeting with regulators.""China still likes to promote its technology firms as global leaders just as long as they don't get too big for their britches,"" said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research.CONTROLLING STAKEAlthough Ma had previously stepped down from corporate positions, he retains effective control over Ant and significant influence over Alibaba.While he only owns a 10% stake in Ant, Ma exercises control over the company through related entities, according to Ant's IPO prospectus.Hangzhou Yunbo, an investment vehicle for Ma, has control over two other entities that own a combined 50.5% stake of Ant, the prospectus shows. Yunbo can decide all matters related to Ant and exercise the combined voting power of the three entities, the prospectus shows.Ma holds a 34% equity interest in Yunbo, the prospectus shows.One of the sources with company ties said there's ""a big chance"" Ma would sell his equity interest in Yunbo to exit from Ant, ultimately paving the way for the fintech major to move closer to completing its revamp and reviving its listing.Reuters could not reach Yunbo for comment. Ant did not provide a comment on behalf of Yunbo.",0.9987

ANT, what happen then? (so, just be clear, even with IPO pause, they made 3-4 b profit...mind blowing, its fintech dominance is beyond any competitor's reach...that why ccp pay so much attention on it. IPO 2.0 is for sure but with holding company version, conservative speaking, should still valued at 50% of original)5. regulation, us delist...(how many times you heard about this, how many times you seen it really happens...Xi mentioned BABA in his gov report as one of china's great achievements, so they wont destory baba, on the contrary, they want to grow baba to make them proud but with more control for sure; baba is maybe the most transparent tech giant compared with its competitor their, their audit and book are done by PWC HK, they intentionally use a HK but not a mainland big accounting firm to show people their serious about transparency and not cooking anything there)6. SP target overstated? (depends what scenarios you are looking at, based on their guideline and a scale down ANT IPO2.0, 300+ should be a humble one, of course, using a more negative one, we can also conclude some number around 250, anything below that is hard to find rational way to support that)we are below 210 now. in the past 6 months, how many people can really believe we will see this level again after last winter? these are all I can think of, welcome any informative thoughts",0.9986
