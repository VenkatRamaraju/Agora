1,"Peloton Interactive, Inc. (NASDAQ: PTON) CEO John Foley: “Very Bullish on Sales Growth Post-Pandemic”“...When the vaccine was announced in the fall, you saw a reaction to the stock, but we did not see any reaction to our sales or demand. We still have not seen any softening since that vaccine was announced and since the vaccine has been rolling out. So other than investors getting nervous, the consumers are still feeling like they want to work out at home. The Peloton experience is the best in the world. And it's getting better as we launch more software features, more content types, more access on more different platforms….We're very bullish on our sales opportunities on the other side of the (post-pandemic) opening... we're excited to get on the offensive and start marketing, because the story is incredible, the products and the experiences are incredible, and they're getting better by the month. So we've remained very, very bullish on our opportunity. We haven't seen any softening of demand.”",0.9968

But that was what the numbers said. So I bought more Honda because it must be undervalued and then I studied PTON. Sure enough --It was WAY OVER VALUED.

84,"Great work on the real reflation trade relayed in Barron’s:If credit markets can remain calm, the pain may only be starting for the market’s most expensive, (formerly) best-performing stocks, says Christopher Harvey, U.S. equity strategist at Wells Fargo Securities. He screened for stocks that had supersized 12-month returns at the end of 2020, faster relative growth, price/earnings ratios that were more than double that of the Russell 1000, and a minimum market capitalization of $10 billion. Among the stocks that qualified for the basket: Tesla, Peloton (PTON), Etsy (ETSY), Roku (ROKU), and Zoom Video Communications (ZM), all of which fell at least 9% this past week.T￼he biggest risk for these companies is that there is no ready buyer, if longtime holders become forced sellers. They’re too expensive for value investors—the few of them that are left—and those seeking growth at a reasonable price. And with growth no longer hard to come by, these stocks are likely to continue dropping. “When growth is abundant, and will stay abundant, scarcity value has to shrink,” Harvey says. “That’s why we’re beginning to see the rotation.”",0.9537

Demand will dry up when the pandemic is over. False. Overvalued. False (especially after last week - it’s a bargain at these prices). It doesn’t even matter what arguments the bashers put forth because none of them change the fact that Peloton has unending explosive demand for their products that can’t currently be met. What a fantastic problem to have. Think about THAT for a few minutes. This is the stage Peloton is in right now. I’ll tell two friends and they’ll tell two friends and they’ll tell two friends and they’ll tell two friends, etc. The company is a money making machine and is just getting started. The revolution in at home fitness has begun and Peloton is the leader of the Peloton. Last weeks sell off by big money for profits and to generate cash for gradual sector rotation into pandemic beaten down industries does not change the fact that Peloton is a superior growth company and will be for decades to come. I heard from a friend at Microsoft that Peloton is working with their VR division to implement virtual reality software into their riding experience. Can you imagine being able to put on a VR headset and a pair of thin micro sensor gloves, select a country, location, season and weather to ride your bike in and it feels like you are really there? No other competitor will have this technology because there will be an exclusivity contract between Microsoft and Peloton for at least one year. This is only one reason why Apple won’t enter the hardware/software arena for Peloton (they’d be too far behind and not a leader which is not Apples style to play catch-up). I mean seriously, what would they call the merged product...Appleton? Feed your body, feed your mind, stay strong, live long and prosper. The future belongs to the believers and is ours for the taking. Bashers are just a bit of sad unfortunate bit of roadkill along the journey. Hey! Maybe Peloton will include “basher roadkill” in a future version of their software. Wouldn’t that be awesome! You’re riding along someplace in VR and suddenly a basher appears crawling across the road (bashers usually don’t walk upright from years of being locked up in confined cramped boiler room sub-spaces). You see it (the basher), but know you can’t stop and so run over it or if you’re in a peloton, the entire cyclist group runs over it. You hear the thump thump as your tires ride over the basher, but can’t afford to take your eyes off the road. You console yourself knowing that animal control will pick up the carcass within 24 hours",0.991

The idea that nobody will want their bikes once gyms are fully back open is ludicrous...there are going to be plenty of people who won't be going back to the gym...this was a trend already started prior to COVID, COVID accelerated it, and many of the trends COVID helped spur on, like home gyms and virtual chat, will play gigantic roles in people's lives after COVID is gone. PTON will only continue to grow. So shorts may have won the short term battle, but long term they are still going to lose the war. Yahoo shorts like AndrewJ, Zinaldo, Elmer, and the like who say home gyms are a fad that will disappear are the reason they are where they are..on yahoo, not on a CNBC talk show.

Next psychological and emotional support lies around 65ish. Buyers at that level likely feel an emotional connection to the stock with strong conviction regarding their pton thesis, however, it’s very breakable given a rapid market descent and a changing market environment which is unfavorable for PTONs business. After those sellers, you’re headed back down to the region where the stock will find extremely strong support. Between the 45ish region and around IPO price. Buyers in this region have watched their wealth soar an unimaginable amount. While also watching it decline. They’ve likely developed strong convictions that peloton is the next Apple. It will be very difficult to dislocate them from their shares. However, it always depends on supply/demand at such a level and when short sellers start to take over, things can get ugly. It also depends on prospects of business which needs to be more certain to attract new buyers. Personally, I see PTON down to 45 by June/July",0.988

Sales growth was driven primarily by continued demand for connected fitness bikes and treadmills, like the Bowflex VeloCore bike and T22 Treadmill, and robust sales of SelectTech weights.

We expect our operating expenses to increase in the future as we continue our sales and marketing efforts, continue to invest in research and development, expand our operating and retail infrastructure, add content and software features to our platform, expand into new geographies, develop new Connected Fitness Products, and in connection with legal, accounting, and other expenses related to operating as a new public company. These efforts and additional expenses may be more costly than we expect, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase our revenue to offset our operating expenses. Our revenue growth may slow or our revenue may decline for a number of other reasons, including reduced demand for our products and services, increased competition, a decrease in the growth or reduction in size of our overall market, the impacts to our business from the COVID-19 pandemic, or if we cannot capitalize on growth opportunities.

New Markets and Products Are on the Horizon.Credit Suisse’s Gajrawala estimates the company will have 3.1 million subscribers this year and 11 million by fiscal year 2025.Last week, Peloton completed the $420 million acquisition of Precor, a maker of exercise equipment. The deal means Peloton can start making its products in the U.S. rather than overseas. The deal gives Peloton a chance to expand beyond at-home customers.

My theory is that the people who had the $$, and time on their hands, due to covid, most of them have already bought the bike. The rest of us, if we want to stay inside and ride to nowhere, will buy one of the cheaper (a lot cheaper) alternatives. I put my 'real' bike on rollers and watch a travel video on my BIG screen tv when the weather is bad, and it's much more fun.... at least to ME.

999,"PETER PUMPER ZINALDO asked for the short fundamental case:1) Most importantly---stock price and market cap was driven high by pandemic demand. Because that demand was driven by a force that is slacking it goes to an economic fundamental of demand likely to weaken which means lower desire for the products and likely a reduction in sales. Thus shorts believe sales will weaken because demand will weaken;2) Also important is the SUPPLY issue which at this moment seems IFFY at best and markets like certainty above all else. All other retailers that depend on PORTS and SHIPPING from China have REPORTED SUPPLY chain problems, IN FACT, PTON management has issued a supply side warning. Bulls wont talk about this issue but since NIKE and RICHARD SPORTING GOODS said it IS IMPACTING their bottom line, it would be prudent for stock owners to HEED WARNINGS about supply;3) ALSO very important is EARNINGS---If supply is a problem then earnings will be impacted EVEN IF demand is still 100% the same as pandemic--PTON is said to spend $100 MILLION to fly in bikes--that $100 million gets DEDUCTED from Q3 earnings so it has an EFFECT. Bulls want to ignore. Likewise because supply has CAUSED delays PTON is issuing consumer REBATES for delays--$100-$300 to full cancellations will SHOW UP also on earnings cuts and it is an UNKNOWN at this time; 4) COSTS are up. Cost of gasoline to deliver goods UP. Cost of wages are going up. cost of empty stores keep coming. etc. Its not good.5) SPENDING on NEW AQUISITIONS cost money and that comes from EARNINGS or DEBT alos NOT good for current share price6) COMPETITION INCREASING---TONAL MIRROR IFIT APPLE and MANY others coming into this space meaning less TAM.I can go on.

1027,Extradebaby 2008---You said yesterday that there are more irrational buyers on stock market than most short sellers can wait out ...or something to that effect. Correct which is why I was more worried at 165 than now at 95. At 165 I was not sure that bubble or irrational exuberance was over. Or was it just a pause? Now at $95 I am much more confident that the exuberance bubble (momentum) has stopped and that there are not enough buyers to take it back up into that bubble. So to me then if the bubble is deflating what will stop the deflation ?Is it a takeover? No PTON is WAY overpriced so can't be a target for anyone with a brain. Can Pton buy another competitor and make more space for itself? I dont see that because no one will want PTON shares as substitute for cash. Does PTON have enough cash to buy someone else? I dont think so because of their massive debt level. What about PTON management? Not likely to help when they are busy dumping their own shares (stakes in company)? So that is why I am WAY more confident at $95 then at $165. Deflation of the ARK complex including PTON is happening and reflation of value stocks is happening and inflation is happening. ALL those macro factors are against PTON. But I get being confident of shorting at $165 because you knew that even if it blew up more it was headed down no matter what but I was scared of that ride up....Now I dont see anything besides Market Makers and funds moving this around 20% either way...the rest of the ride is drip drip down,0.8767

1174,"UH OH!!Apple Watch debuted in 2015, and after several years of development, Fitness+ is LAUNCHING with a library of around 200 workouts ranging in duration from ten to 45 minutes in ten modalities: strength, HIIT, core, cycling, walking, running, rowing, yoga, dance, and mindful cooldown. People can stream sweat sessions to their phones, iPads, and Apple TV—all quarterbacked by the Apple Watch on your wrist. By midsummer you should be able to carry as many as 1,000 workouts in your pocket, and for students of Apple’s decades-long attempts to redefine and dominate the worlds of mobile technology, music, movies, and more, it’s easy to hear an echo.

Separately, not out of a sense of opportunism but more so incumbency stemming from Peloton’s brand ethos and emphasis on community, we think Peloton management may take this time to further lean into safety awareness campaigns, layer in more conscientious integration of warnings alongside content, and potential innovations around safety for updated iterations of the product line-up."" • The firm keeps an Outperform rating on Peloton as it waits for news on the new Tread launch.",0.9697

Maybe they can mitigate their costs on these facilities through contract manufacturing for others. There is also the issue of rising input costs. Steel; Rubber;Plastic;Touch Screens; Chips..

Alternatively, at your request, we will relocate the Tread+ to a location in your home where access by children or pets is restricted, free of charge.We also will be automatically installing the following updates to your Tread+ operating system: • Automatic Lock: The Tread+ will now automatically lock 45 seconds after each use. • Passcode: Peloton will require you to enable a 4-digit passcode to unlock the Tread+ so that only authorized users may use it. Do not share the Tread+ passcode with anyone under the age of 16, or others who cannot safely operate the Tread+.Please keep in mind that serious injuries can still occur if a child, pet, or object contacts the back of the Tread+ while it is in use. For that reason, always keep children and pets away from the Tread+ at all times, and make sure that the area behind your Tread+ is kept clear during workouts so that exercise balls and other loose objects do not get pulled underneath the Tread+ during use. Always make sure you use the safety key while using the Tread+ and remove it when the Tread+ is not in use, storing it out of reach of children.You are receiving this email because you are the subscription owner for your household’s Peloton membership.

2315,I have followed this board occasionally for awhile now and would like to share some perspective I think most don't have because of my position and experience in this industry. I've owned this stock at 50 (a lot of it - and still have it) and I happen to own multiple brick and mortar gym franchises. What happened in 2020 was clearly awful but what you saw happen only accelerated the what had already started in the way of industry transformation. We already had demand starting for remote classes/training and the pandemic increased this demand. Apple had recognized this and Fitness+ wasn't something they simply created because of the events in 2020. Convenience based fitness is real and is staying - much the same way on-demand streaming media is now. My gyms are now open but many members aren't coming back as they have moved on to offerings like this as it's more economical and convenient for their needs.If you haven't ever used Peloton or talked to anyone who has you may not understand what the experience is like and the brand they are building (to somewhat of a cult like following). This is a tech fitness company who recognizes that traditional gyms will always have their place and Peloton is going to get a piece of that by expanding upon what they already have. The Precor acquisition does more than help supply chain and equipment issues...as a gym owner it's difficult to staff/fill classes (particularly those around spin and other speciality offering such as yoga). There is going to be a time when Peloton offers traditional gyms/hotels the ability to outfit their gyms with commercial cardio and consoles that take advantage of their app and live/on-demand classes. Gym members will be able to buy an add-on membership to a traditional gym memberships to take advantage of this (best of both). Can't make it to the gym today but have access to the app?...no problem you can use it at home or on the road. It's also worth mentioning that you don't have to buy their equipment to use and receive benefit from the app. This is why the CEO is focused on memberships. Ultimately this is a services company in the early stages backed by world class staff and a very well rounded offering that touches all places where people want to maintain healthy lifestyle. Traditional gyms will still have their place but Peloton will have the reach to service many more and with a higher quality/more efficient model.Hopefully some will find this information useful.,0.9982

We will, of course, share details as we develop a plan and a timeline for these additional safety features, but bear in mind that hardware features take time to develop, test and manufacture, and in this case, the CPSC will need to approve our proposed enhancements.""Reality/Expectations:Being that TWO WEEKS have already transpired and there has been ZERO 'sharing' of any details, do not expect a HARDWARE fix for many months, very likely NEXT YEAR, if at all.On the one hand, being that the Tread+ has been on the market for nearly three years and only secured a tiny 1% of all treadmill sales, the smart business decision would be to cancel all Tread+ production and related HARDWARE fix costs.But on the other hand, as PTON executives love to skim money from the company, in the name of some kind of expense (i.e. $100M extra for shipping, $15M for Suez Canal blockage, etc.), I can see PTON executives using this as another 'expense' opportunity to skim hundreds of millions more from the company for the next 9-12 months.",0.9924

Here's why PCMAG, a highly respected reviewer, says ""Both bikes are expensive, and you have to pay extra for a class membership, but the Connect EX5S undercuts the Peloton Bike by around $600. Peloton makes just one stationary bike model.Echelon makes four different Connect models, starting at $839.98 for the screenless EX1 that works with your smartphone or tablet. Its top-of-the-line EX5S, the company's only model with a built-in display, starts at $1,639.98 for the bike, a one-year warranty, and a one-month class membership. Both companies offer financing options to make the price more manageable. ""In terms of aesthetics and key features, the EX5S is well stacked against its rival.' And this doesn't even count competition from nordictrack and proform.

3071,"So, I have never seen a picture of a peloton treadmill until today. I saw the pic in an article about the recall. As soon as I saw the pic, I said to myself, ""whoah, that is a horrible design because somebody could get pulled under it"". Stuff like this is ridiculous. It is a blatantly obvious safety design flaw that should have been avoided from the beginning. It is something that I have also seen with many other treadmills.

So, while Peloton may be doing well right now, I would be hesitant to invest as over the longer term, as the company's impressive growth rate will likely slow down. And to make matters worse, Peloton is also coming under pressure to issue a recall on its treadmills after a child died in an accident involving one. The company is trying to fight the recall, but it's unclear how the issue will play out.

I averaged up at 100, 110, 120, 130, and 140. If peloton wanted to turn a profit, they would. Precor is a multibillion-dollar business, and the acquisition of a low-margin workout equipment manufacturer is going to drive even greater revenue growth. All of those gyms and hotel chains that are struggling financially will invest in highly-priced peloton bikes that everyone is asking for. Just the other day, I called my local super 8 motel and asked if I could get a Peloton bike the next time I stay there. Don't get me started on retail stores. This is a super low margin business with long-term contracts, the revenue growth from being in malls will be insane. The shorties just don't get it. 80 dollars a month for a peloton membership and bike is a bargain-basement price to pay to sit in your basement alone in front of a screen pedaling to nowhere. Lot's of people can afford that, and lots of people want to afford that. They have to be part of the next big thing.

The stock has done exceptionally well due to Covid, but I'm not confident about this stock post-Covid over the next 5-10 years as international growth may be tough given that incomes outside of the western world are generally much much lower and in-person activities may be preferred.

3799,"PTON projections for FYq4 2021 is ""Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, two years prior."" So in FY Q4 2019, they had 158m in connected fitness product revenue. Let's put it on the high end and say sales will be 3.9x of 2019. That get's you to 616m in sales for bikes and still roughly 240m in subs. Play around with the sub number however you want. Plus 60m in precor revenue gets you to the projected 910m. So 27% in growth of connected fitness products (on high end), 40% growth in revenue of core business. All in all not terrible. So... why aren't they making money? Well, how about because they opened a ton of new retail locations to sell one product, bought a low margin equipment manufacturer, and keep giving executives millions of dollars in bonuses (in shares that they immediately sell). If earnings were increasing, this price might make sense. But they aren't. These products also cater to the affluent, which quickly saturates after the explosive growth that they saw. And on the retail locations, shouldn't this be a large contributor to growth? It should be, and the opening of those locations may be the only thing keeping them from projecting negative revenue growth. A projection I expect to occur for Q1 FY 2022.",0.9756

As it expands its product line and moves into new markets, it should be able to increase its customer base, Credit Suisse said.

I have spoken with many women who used to go regularly to cycle at a gym or studio but now have a PTON bike. They are not giving up their PTON bikes. Some may go back to the gym or soul cycle for a feel good ride but the cost and convenience of PTON are way too good to give up. The price PTON chargers for an entire family to work out, plus convenience, plus new connected fitness devices coming and their exclusive partnerships. And higher income clients don't care, they could have both. My assumptions are really easy. Base is established and growing. Base will not cancel their memberships. Will attract more users. Will produce more equipment that will make the subscription that much more efficient to a user. Will expand into new territories. Will partner with a major healthcare provider to offer equipment with health plan. Will remain an attractive target for big tech acquisition. Will be entering the S&P 500 this year.

4410,"'Peter' posted, ""According to a recent survey by Wedbush, 20% of pre-pandemic gym-goers have purchased at-home gym equipment....""- The results of that survey are convincing enough to short PTON stock; and, here's why:- ""There were 64.2 US million gym members in 2019, up 2.7% from 62.5 million in 2018 [IHRSA 2019]."" (aka 'pre-pandemic gym-goers')Let's apply the survey results; I will even be EXTREMELY generous and assume PTON's Bike+ is the ONLY ""at-home gym equipment"" that was purchased.Here are the calculations:- 20% of 64.2 US million pre-pandemic gym members = 12.84M 'pre-pandemic gym-goers'- 12.84M 'pre-pandemic gym-goers' x $2,495 (full cost of Peloton bike+) = $32BSo $32B would be the TOTAL, ALL-TIME, absolute MAXIMUM Revenue, that Peloton would ever see in the USA.Let's look at PTON's current Market Cap as of the today's closing price ... $34.2BSo PTON stock's current Market Cap exceeds the TOTAL, ALL-TIME, absolute MAXIMUM Revenue, that Peloton would ever see in the USA by $2.2B !!!Now lets project these numbers out to Australia.Australia's population is 25.36MUSA's population is 328.2M- 25.36M/328.2M x 100 = 7.7%- 7.7% of $32B = $2.47B which would be the TOTAL, ALL-TIME, absolute MAXIMUM Revenue, that Peloton would ever see in Australia.Adding both numbers together, PTON's market cap currently reflects the TOTAL, ALL-TIME, absolute MAXIMUM Revenue, that Peloton would ever see in the USA and Australia Combined.OK, so with everyone possible owning a PTON Bike+, where are the future sales going to come from?Because there will be ZERO additional Revenue coming from both the USA and Australia.So it becomes crystal clear that PTON stock is WAY OVER-Valued at it's current stock price.And these calculations are based on PTON being the ONLY manufacturer of ""at-home gym equipment"", which is unrealistic, of course.",0.9899
