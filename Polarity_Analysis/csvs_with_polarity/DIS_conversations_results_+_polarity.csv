1,"With a bit of inheritance money I've been learning about stocks. Much the novice and a relative dabbler but what I am investing is a good bit of money for me.So, my wife has owned Disney stock for years and done quite well out of it. We love Disney but I do get baffled by box office and park takings breaking records but price dropping after steady increases before. Seems counter intuitive.. Still, I've got a couple of positions I'm not happy with which will be sold very soon.. When I sell I was thinking of moving it to Disney. Thought I'd do that shortly before ER or if I see the price down to $140. Am I on the right track?",0.9919
2,"Well, DIS is dead money for at least 2 months. The coronavirus is just going to get worse, decimating a few of DIS’s revenue streams. The only silver lining is that the more ppl that stay home, the more traffic Disney+ should get",-0.2935

6,"I think Disney+ should have a preregistration period. Maybe a month before launching. You could create an account, pay ahead of time, and maybe even set your preferences. That way when it launches you can just download the app and login. The consumer part of me wants this so I can start checking it out right away when it's available, and the investor part of me wants it so Disney can report on preregistration numbers. :)",0.9081

11,"Why are people so shocked at the stock going down a little? The stock is up over $20 in a month! That is based on the hype of Disney+ and Avengers End Game projected numbers. It was overbought a little and there is some profit taking going on, movies are one time hits and Disney + is still just hype with no real numbers yet. It rose $20 based on this, enjoy the price, but it won't just keep going on up based on a one time hit of a movie.",0.6825

31,"Anyone claiming the recent ""rally"" in gold is somehow indicative of a downturn in the market is drawing conclusions.Why would a hedge fund invest in gold?Maybe because gold broke under 1300 and was priced to sell? Having a ""7 day rally"" means little if gold drops back under 1300.My guess, and it really is just a guess, gold couldn't reach 1350, so I wouldn't be surprised to see it back under 1300.Dis on the other hand had a strong bounce at 131, broke 137 today and could push back into 140 range. Im not bashing investing in gold... I just don't see any reason to sell off my Dis shares to do so.",0.453

43,"I can't believe how badly this company wants to destroy itself. I grew up with Star Wars and lost interest with the last three movies. I tried to like it but it's all political now and I just want to relax into an adventure. I started watching Mandalorian during season 2 and they gave one of the most iconic moments with the return of Luke Skywalker and I was actually excited about it again. Now they fire Gina Carano, who I've been following for years because of MMA, over some tweet? A tweet almost identical to another co-star? When are they going to realize the people that complain aren't their customers? I'm their customer and they just lost me again! They clearly don't care about investors as well otherwise they would be working to make actual fans happy. Fans spend money!",0.9801

47,Curious downgrade a day before earnings. Why jump before numbers and guidance being released next day. This is obvious manipulation. Saw a similar thing with FB on the Q4 earning release where on the earnings release day there was an analyst upgrade that pumped the stock and the earning disappointed and the stock crashed after earnings.

58,Dis spent a fortune on Star Wars land so they need to pack I. People and extend lines to pay the billions in loans back. As part of this they banned strollers and cut down trees to free up every inch for liner lines - sounds like a real dream vacation and it only costs $150 a person ( including kids) to wait in lines all day leading to a maximum of 4 rides,0.8492

66,"Oversold on all time frames, this is worth at least $200.00 All these people selling will be back once all Marvel Original shows on Disney+ are released. The Mandalorian was just a taste of what's coming. Park Revenue will have a slow recovery but that part of the business is already priced in as dead IMO. $180 stock price is only the valuation for Disney+, Hulu, ESPN, ABC and all the other networks they own. Toy Sales and Licensing alone is a multi-billion dollar business and Disney literally owns every mainstream franchise. WAYUNDERVALUED",0.9148
67,Such a strong stock. I see this being a strong year for DIS.,0.8303
68,You will be rewarded for your patience.,0.5761
69,DIS is incredibly undervalued and has so much runway ahead of it. DIS has yet to scratch the surface of its streaming potential. Almost everyone who understands investing can see the potential of DIS simply by unlock their old business models and become leaders in online streaming through the offering of their vast media library and unmatched growth with new stories. For media or content they are one CEO away from becoming the TSLA or AMZN of all media entertainment. Their competition is giving them the opportunity of a generation.,0.9483

78,At $500 a share this would still be undervalued. I expect a lot of covering at earnings. If the stock gets some reddit yolo attention wouldn't be surprised if it hits big and shorts cover like crazy and boost the stock up to obscene levels but we will see.,0.4826

84,"What happens to DIS's earnings in 2Q and 3Q 2020?I just did a back of the napkins calculation for just 2Q 2020. Below is what I came up with. You can use your imagination for your own estimate of 3Q 2020. Even if Disney manage to open its parks and release movies, they will sustain even more significant operating losses because attendance will be down 50% to 80% and they will still have to pay the park stuff and show performers. If 2Q and 3Q top lines are 75% down, then, this whole year is a toast, 4Q will still be similar. I suspect that it doesn't matter how well contained Covid 19 will be by the end of the year, its damage to DiS financial results will be for the rest of 2020 because the Covid 19 present a systematic risk the health official in US, Asia, and Europe will not be able to justify. Today's downgrade by the analyst on the surface is a downgrade but in reality is to reassure to DIS investors that DIS will still have positive earnings of $2.90 per share. This certainly allows the big institutional investors who want to exit DIS enough time to get out if they have not got out already.",0.9386

96,Told you all that it wasn’t going to break after ER... said it would have a nice day going up to it. 100% right. You can read my messages. This will go down all the way till next earnings. Why would it go up? They wont have a better 1/4 than the last one and you know it. Good luck. My last Disney post. Feels good to be right.,0.9136
97,"Just read an article on Seeking Alpha that basically said the outlook for Disney in 2019 is not good because streaming is going to cost them a lot of money. If we judge something on how much money it's going to cost instead of how much money it's going to bring in, then Netflix should be paying people to take their stock! I just don't get it. They are investing in streaming, of course it's going to cost money! Unless you are a short seller of DIS stock, I see absolutely no red flags here.",0.6128

101,"If in a couple years Disney announces amazing earnings and reports great stats on streaming and we are still at 110, then I'll start to worry. Until then, who cares what the price is! People who complain that DIS has been flat for the past few years are not looking into the WHY. If you look at the reason investors lost interest in DIS, then you'll see that Disney is fixing it. The only reason it is still within the 100-120 range is because investors want to see results before they build trust. Those who lost trust have doubt that the way Disney is fixing the problem will work, so we are not out of the weeds yet. Personally I never lost trust, so I'm just holding tight.",0.963

By earnings should at least be 30-45 million. Disney’s goal was to have 60-90 mil subscribers by 2024. It is feasible they could hit half their target by earnings in Feb. Amazing!

118,"NFLX will have to spend much much more to retain customers when Disney starts to pull their contents from their steaming service in preparation for Disney's own. Naturally, NFLX will have to price to either buy or make their own contents which will turn many subscribers off and force them to look for better bargain. Disney already has tons of contents that are just sitting. Their stable of directors and studios can churn out tons more at a steady rate. Hard to argue that Disney will dominate this segment.

Anyways here is my advice if you decide to listen to experience and common sense:Of course you have heard oil prices are at record breaking levels (negative mind you). The ensuing oil company bankruptcies will also add to the already staggering unemployment numbers and further adding to the ruins of this economy. It's not just about coronavirus and social distancing when it comes to Disney, the whole economy is about to tank. Disney will just be hit extra hard, in the nuts. Sell, scrape together some cash, and get ready to buy in 6 months all the amazing deals.

Not only will it lower the cost to consumers, it will be more profitable for Disney. They can also promote and sell their merchandise to their target audience",0.7023
139,"I thought I'd post a medium length report on our recent trip to Disneyland. Fair warning right up front I own shares in Disney. I bought a pretty good chunk at 112 and have held it since.So - I went with my wife, three kids and their significant others. Also coming were my daughter-in-law's father and my beautiful two-and-a-half year old granddaughter.Perhaps you've seen some recent reports on low attendance at Disneyland. I heard a couple of reports calling it a ""ghost town"". That is total nonsense! We went on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, Naturally Thursday was the least crowded, but even then there were plenty of people in the park. What was true is that the opening of Galaxy's Edge has changed the distribution of people within the park, The lines at Smuggler's Run were substantial and took the pressure off a lot of the other rides. Speaking of Smuggler's Run, this is perhaps the best ride in the park! This is especially true if you can go with a group of six friends or family members. Unlike any other ride I've been on, the small group of six goes into a small vehicle simulating the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon. The group is not just ""along for the ride"" but actually influence the flight and success of the mission. The six of us unanimously agreed that this made it an overwhelming success. My only regret of the trip was we didn't just turn around and jump back into line for a second run.You see a lot of critics of the parks saying they are both ""too expensive"" and ""too crowded"". I don't understand this. If you make it cheaper it will become even more crowded. If you want to make it less crowded, you would think you would have to make it more expensive. (It's like Yogi Berra's quote ""No one goes there anymore, it's too popular""). But I think Disney has actually succeeded at this. By opening up Galaxy's Edge at the north edge of the park, other rides have had their lines reduced. I think the number of people attending has increased, but the new attractions have increased the capability of the park even more.Other observations-The fast pass and max pass features are wonderful. I don't think any other amusement park has anything close. While waiting in line for Smuggler's Run I was able to make fast pass reservations for Toy Story, Soaring and Radiator Springs. We were then able to go on all of those rides within about 90 minutes. The Disney app had many other features too. Pulling up the map would tell you the wait times for all of the rides any time you wanted.From a stockholder's viewpoint, Disney has expanded on their ability to painlessly separate visitors from their money, It certainly worked on me.On our last night we dined as a group at Carthay Circle, This is a wonderful high end restaurant and it fully met all expectations. Total tab for the ten of us with cocktails, wine and dinner was a little over $1K. (which I had planned on). From a stockholder's viewpoint this was the only negative in that the restaurant did not seem to be completely jam packed. I would say it was about 80 percent full.Overall this trip has convinced me to sell some of my other stocks and buy even more Disney. My target is to make it about 15 percent of my portfolio.",0.9994

258,"With the 2nd fiscal quarter ended, and with the earnings announcement about 1 month away, it's time for my quarterly prediction. I will use last year's 2nd quarter as a starting point - $1.50.First, add about 20 cents for the tax benefits. Now look at the movies – last year we had three good movies carrying over from the past quarter (Dr. Strange, Moana, and SW Rogue One). This year the three “carry overs” did, generally, better – probably about $500 million more, although the carry over amounts are probably better (if SWTLJ did better, I would have added something). Last year, we had Beauty & Beast, a very good movie, but it came out in the middle of March, so all of its $1.25 billion can't be considered. This year, we have BP, most of its $1.275 billion in the second quarter – a huge hit. I would add about 15 cents for this movie – but Wrinkle in Time, which added some revenues, it not so hot. It's domestic is not great, and it is not generating a lot overseas. Take off 5 cents.The other segments are doing well – at least the parks. The parks will add 5 cents, in part because Shanghai is not a drain, but a positive, and the overseas parks (particularly Paris) are doing better. I think that consumer sales benefited by Star Wars and BP (and I saw one article about video games), but I'm going to say even. I think that ESPN and media and cable are about even with last year, but there may be some benefit because the New Year football games were in this quarter this year rather than last year it was in the prior quarter (although revenues might have been offset by expenses). There may also be some expenses for setting up the new ESPN app. I would say up a penny. One other issue, Easter was earlier this year, affecting the 2nd quarter. That may add something to the various segments; further, some stock buybacks are going to add something – I'm going to add 4 cents.There may be some expenses for the Fox merger and other app expenses. I'm going to take off 5 cents.That would give you $1.85. Add that to the the 1.89 for the fits, and you are at $3.74 at the half way mark. Next quarter, with Avengers ($1.5 billion?), Hans Solo ($1 billion??), and The Incredibles ($750 million?) will give the third quarter reason to approach $2.00 a share.

Outside of that I haven't seen much else appealing, but perhaps I just need to dig a little more. I'm hoping ESPN+ continues to grow and attract more live major sports. There is definitely potential there to grow. I think the bundle with DIS+ and Hulu will help with that. I also think there is big opportunity for ESPN to get into sports betting to compete with the likes of FanDuel, DraftKings, MonkeyKnifeFight, etc. They already have a solid customer base with their fantasy football leagues each year.

The US Congress and the Fed are now in the picture dumping a limitless supply of fiat funds on corporations and banks. They have an unlimited checkbook. Post 2008 should have taught you something.Now Disney has announced fastastic numbers for its streaming service and plans to build a new theme park. If the Covid19 numbers improve quicker than the gloomy predictions are saying the retail shorts will get crushed. So there is significant risk in shorting this company with little upside potential.

The data in this report is through the first 13 days of launch. Thus far, we estimate the mobile app has been downloaded 15.5 million times and has generated $5 million through in-app purchases. Apptopia revenue data is always post app store fees.[Sidebar: Shortly after we announced Disney+ first day download numbers, the company itself announced 10 million subscribers. Some were initially confused on the discrepancy between 3.2 million mobile app downloads and 10 million subscribers. This makes perfect sense though; our numbers say that on day one, 32% of subscribers downloaded the mobile app. For this type of service, mobile downloads come second. Most people install Disney+ on their Roku or Apple TV first. While Disney’s 10 million subscribers are impressive, they were not all signed up within 24 hours. Consumers were able to sign up for the service weeks before launch. And while I do not know this for fact, I assume the 10 million subscribers have not all agreed to pay the company money. A certain percentage definitely have, but many were either on their free trial or receiving the service for free through Verizon.]Disney+ has been ranking #1 overall in the U.S. iOS and Google Play app stores since its launch. It has been #1 in iOS grossing ranks since 11/19 and since 11/20 on Google Play. With regards to revenue, keep in mind that due to the free trial, there was not much money being generated prior to a week after launch. There are also many users receiving the service for free due to Verizon’s deal for its unlimited data customers. Many users may choose to pay outside of the app as well.",0.9969

Think about it this way, most, in the know people knew Dis + was coming and signed up on the first day (that is the world we live in, everyone wants to be first). The second wave won't be even remotely as big, as it will entail old generations that get talked into it by their kids or grandkids. We are by far the largest population that will get it, so other countries will add to it but in a much smaller capacity. A percentage of the signups were through Verizon, being free to the users for a year. Like XM, some will let it expire after a year. Another percentage of signups were through the trial version which some won't extend it and pay for it. Way too many players in the streaming game to get overly excited about it as it costs money to keep content fresh and new and subs coming in and renewing. I love Dis, but this stock isn't heading to 160 anytime soon, it will likely level off in the mid 140s which is still pretty awesome.

I subscribe because they offer a few shows my wife and I enjoy, and an occasional movie (usually a licensed movie, not original).

574,"Part 2 @Scott on my Disney/company, now DIS/stock, sentiments from 2 days ago. To think of DIS in this recent ""7 trading day"" vs ""11 calendar day"" slide from what was appearing to be a solid base in the mid 140's over the last few months (12/3 - 1/22 approx.), and on absolutely no negative news from the company, suggests to those whom which have developed that ""6th sense"" on the stock market over the years that DIS has simply been put behind an essential market wall by those who try and control (yes manipulate) the stock. Think of it like a deep military front + second line of defense from our Civil - WWI/II days, or even a deep NFL defensive front + middle where any type of offensive push simply gets knocked right back by the 1st or 2nd or even 3rd wave of defensive lines = market maker inventory = book depth in the case of the stock market control of some security. The ultimate question but relative simply and point-blank obvious question is why? Answer > Because those who know how much of a market staple The Walt Disney company has been in the country/world, and dating back to its beginning in 1923, and the stock market, dating back 50+ years ago, know that, not A, but with THIS/THE global leader in entertainment that Walt Disney has been is now in a legitimate cross-over or hybrid state into media technology (streaming) or think of it like The Walt Disney company setting it self up and its ultimate shareholders to being able to literally have its cake, the icing and being able to eat it all too given the company's ultimate success history in animation/shows, films, theme parks, merchandise, and now being able to take all of that historic content coupled with its trusted and cult-like followed brand and be able to create and add even more brand new content for the world to be able to continue to enjoy. However, going back to my sentiments on DIS, the stock, and what has been going on with this recent sub 2-week slide, think of the stock price action to that of one big rubber band or sling shot being pulled back, compliments to the pro mm's, as the company heads into a very-much anticipated Feb 4th post-market earnings release; where anticipation meets anxiety for many on the hopeful streaming number release/forecast = the NFLX factor on the future stock price action all in my very honest opinion.

I tend to watch watch a good Marvel comic movie multiple times. At the end of the day, I believe Netflix makes some hit movies and shows, but Disney makes classics, and has a full library of them from the jump. Disney will not need to go into massive debt to create content like Netflix. Classics will draw a massive subscription base at half the cost of Netflix.That being said, I believe there is room for both services with the cable cord cutting movement that continues to build steam.

My family of five is dying to buy annual passes. People are dying to have experiences right now and I don’t think there is a more perfect company that can capitalize on that than Disney. Throw in a streaming business that is due to have several blockbusters come out in late spring/early summer.There is nothing but catalysts on the horizon for this company! The only thing that could derail the bull thesis is poor execution by the government on vaccine rollout or by the South African variant taking over.

Been following Dis for the past 3 years and it's current range reminds me of its trade pattern prior to its breakout of the 120 range last year.It happened time and time again... Hit 120 area then down. (way before covid and lock downs)My logic, Dis was hovering around 120 with parks at capacity and billion dollar blockbuster every other movie and the excitement of a new streaming platform. I have a hard time rationalizing Dis over 120 with no revenue from cruises, parks, theater releases, sporting events revenue via ESPN etc. I still see Dis as a great long term investment, but I have to be realistic and consider the lack of revenue brought on by the global pandemic.I have faith that Dis will hit the 150 mark SOMEDAY, but it might be a while... If you aren't willing to leave your investment for long term or your trying to play the short game, know your risk tolerance and plan accordingly. Best of luck Dis Fam.

883,"I was off. I said 1.90 per share - it was 1.84. I'll take it.With hindsight, what hurt Disney this quarter was A Wrinkle in Time. It should have done about $200 million more. That would have put it at about 1.90 a share.This coming quarter is going to be very very good. Last year, this quarter, Disney opened Guardians, about $855 m (for which Disney was very satisfied with), Pirates, about $800 million (which Disney was ok with given its overseas haul which is why it did it), and Cars, about $350 m (which Disney was not very pleased with) - these total about $2 billion, or a shade less.This year they have opened with Avengers, which could do $2 billion alone!! (I saw one online site that said it was between $1.75 - $2 billion, which I think is a fair estimate - we will know more by the end of this coming weekend). Then we have Solo and Incredibles - both could do $1 billion each. This would translate into 40 cents more than last year's 1.58 per share. We have estimates of $1.96 so far, so that seems about right - but I don't think the tax savings are factor in (about 20 cents) - this could push it nicely over $2.00. But the earnings call mentioned a few pending losses - putting that into context, we might just be a few pennies over $2.00. An early estimate might put this $2.05..The reason this is important is because this could push Disney to have results of over $7.00 a share for the fiscal year.",0.9563

There is unlikely much of these presales after the first weekend. To those that say one movie isn't really much of an effect on profits, I once read that for each $100 million in box office, you gain 2 cents of profits for Disney.

They are not making any more announcements until the February earnings conference call (in accordance to the announcement of the 10 million plus first day signups). I am going to through out a number of 25 million. I could be as high as 40 million. Why you might ask? - I can't really believe that every parent signed up in the first day - a lot had other things to do. And grandparents don't have any motivation until Thanksgiving and Christmas (and other holidays) arrive. And their has just been a lot of growing excitement with the good reviews of the Mandalorian, which is released on a week to week basis (no immediate binge watching!!!).If Disney has a number of 20 million, it will approach 160. 25 million - 165; 40 million - 175 plus. Then we are going to see a few other issues play out over the next year - Does Disney continue to expand its subscribers? Does it lose subscribers when the promotional rates end? How are the international roll outs going (I think Australia has started - any numbers there?).Before Disney entered the streaming wars and bought Fox, I saw Disney as a sure home run - it had a steady growing base of media, parks, royalties, and movies, and selling its content to the streaming media, and was buying back stock at a good rate, so that it was going to increase earnings per share to about $25 over the next 10 - 15 years (the buy backs were a major component).

Sounds like market pumping to me and it will pop. We all know the serious damages the pandemic will hold on parks but people don't seem to realize how it will effect parks long-term. The precautions won't go away and Disney won't be able to operate at full capacity for many years, if ever again. Combine these issues with the operating costs, and you have a Disney company with less profit margins and ultimately a worse performing stock compared to other companies.

The companies that will be losing shares are the cable providers. Both Netflix and Disney will dominate the streaming platform because of content and the delivery of that content. I'm not concerned about Netflix because they deliver a different niche of products and it is already known what really drove subcription growth for Netflix in the first place which was when they started delivering marvel series to their streaming content. Then after is when Netflix began delivering their own originals. Imagine Pixar series, Star Wars series, new Marvel series coming to Disney streaming content. That is not even considering the kid programs that can be added. Imagine espn and fox sport( when Diseny owns Fox)being bundled into this package. live news, UFC, Movies that were in theaters, the lis goes on and on of what is capable on Diseny streaming platform.

Disney will be the key streaming service every household, my bold prediction, will have. We are entering the inexpensive multiple stream phase or era, and it seems like for the foreseeable future, will be here to stay for a very very very very very very long, very long, extremely long, yes, time. The other streaming services, ie netflix will be a specialty content streaming service, but the main service in any household, will be Disney, that will touch every market sector, = age range, is DIS. And we haven't talked about other sectors, such as geographical locations, and if any streaming service has an iota of a chance to break into the chinese strict censorship for their public consumption, it's the mouse that has a chance. And DIS is positioning themselves for a piece of the specialty content action, ergo, the comcast deal. The magic kingdom is moving to the real world now, as far as the entertainment, living room watching sector. They have what matters most= CONTENT tried and proven for over a hundred years, it's basically checkmate. And DIS is actually pulling it off, like a smooth surgeon, ninja.

1114,"The Box Office for Thor and Coco are looking up.Thor seemed to have nice box offices for the last few days - it was tracking nicely in step with Dr. Strange, but it seemed to jump up a little over the tracking of Dr. Strange at the same time. Although it will hit a brick wall when Star Wars comes out, it is helpful. It is very possible, particularly with a nice weekend, that it may do over 315 million domestic. And the overseas numbers are still doing nicely. I've been saying that the worldwide box office is going to limp towards $850 million, and probably fall short - I think it might just beat that $850 with a little to spare (not much to spare, but something).And Coco seems to be breaking out nicely - it was running about 10 - 15 % under Moana (which just fell short of $250 million), and was compared to the Box Office of Tangled (which did just over $200 million). But over the past 4 days its gone past Moana's numbers on a day to day basis. It will interesting whether, on an absolute basis, whether it beats Moana's weekend business a year ago on an absolute number basis. If it does, it can approach Moana's numbers. It will be hard to beat Moana's $248 million domestic number, but it could hit $240 million. And if the overseas numbers hold up, you will see a total number tht beats the overseas number of nearly $650 million - perhaps $750 million.If you don't think that these numbers mean much, I'd say this - I really think that Disney was a touch disappointed with the numbers last year from Moana, Guardian of the Galaxy, Pirates, and Cars. I'm not saying that they were disappointed (well, maybe with Cars), but they probably saw a scenario where they could have gleaned another $500 million in box office - and that would have given Disney with just a slightly better year end figures. That may be the reason that Disney is only buying back about $6 billion in stock, and didn't increase dividends by another penny or two.",0.9929

1136,"honestly reading these messages are funny. alot of people explanation for high share prices are like ""why not"". you guys should do research on Disney. Disney makes 11 billion dollars from box office hits. lets all be honest movie theaters are never coming back, their a dead industry, they were dying covid just expedited it. and Disney makes 20$ a month per user from cable. so you have 11 billion from box office hits and cable revenues from ESPN Disney channel declining rapidly. all your doing at best is replacing current revenues with Disney Plus at a 30x multiple. at 500 a share thats 60x and at 750 a share thats 90x. thats ridiculous. and Disney has alot of baggage, they have 200k workers so if there's another recession and the parks have 50% occupancy their basically losing money. its a cyclical business. Netflix only has 10k workers. thats why Netflix enjoys the tech multiple, less workers, high concentration of algorithms and high focussed. Disney is not a tech company their a tech enabled company. Now if Disney Plus is spun into a separate ipo which I doubt will ever happen because it leaves the park business vulnerable then Disney Plus is a tech company by itself. And tbh I dont think consumers will pay 20$ a month for Disney Plus, I think 13 max so they'll never replace their cable revenues. I think Disney is valued fairly at 185, will probably go to 90 in a recession when multiples shrink and gold rises as inflation rises. my guess 2025-2027. btw this is coming from a guy that bought nio at 1.35, Tesla at 185, qep at 20 cents and GameStop at 5$, I know a thing or two about analyzing stocks.",0.9909

1170,"Aladdin is leading the way for a great quarter. less than a week ago, the general consensus was that it was going to do $75 million this four day weekend. It seems healthy over $110 million, maybe $115. That is a 50% beat. It went from a movie that might break $150 million, and lose money, to a nicely profitable one that might break $300 million. If there is any downside, it is ""only"" at the top end of foreign box office predictions at about $120 million, with only Japan being the remaining market for it to open at. This will make it difficult to break $1 billion. In fact, it may ""only"" do about $750 million.Avengers is ""winding up"". It has about $2.683 billion, just under $100 below Avatar. It does have about $60 billion left from the domestic (it is running, at this time, comparable with Infinity War, so that is what it had left at this time). Can it squeeze another $40 million out of International? - it's going to be tough because China has ended its run. But it is possible that, since it is the last of a great run, it could glean a little more here and there. And it is possible that all of the overseas numbers have not yet come in (I'm not sure that Saudi Arabia's numbers are included at this point). And Disney may have a re-release to drum up some last little business.But Aladdin is the nice nice news. It breaks a Memorial Day losing streak. And it will really means that this quarter is a winner. And this means something because Disney needs a new catalyst to move to the next level. Yes, it has the openings of Star War features at Disneyland and Disneyworld, but that isn't much. And Toy Story 4 will be a hit. And Lion King will be a hit. But there is little else between now and the opening of Disney+. But a profitable Aladdin really means a profitable quarter (with the bookends of Toys Story 4 and Avengers EG) - I think it will make something over $2.50 before charges that Disney noted at its conference call (about 75 cents for dilution and streaming charges).

1236,"Had to at least give D+ a try since I own stock in it. Mandalorian was pretty good and I was able to check out some Disney movies I remembered from the 1970s. It has a very impressive catalog beyond what appears on the main screen. The interface and resolution are quite good and system does remember where you were at in a given show/movie. However, they do need to have a section that shows what you have already viewed, rather than having to go back and search it up again, like Netflix does. But I am sure that will come. Clearly the D+ service itself is G and PG stuff so I assume if you want more adult content you will need to do a Hulu add-on with it. However, for households with children this will be a necessity. Having every Disney channel show and Disney movie at the ready for the little ones will be a no brainer (little kids can watch Pixar stuff on a loop practically). Add in the cheap cost and there will be no reason not to have it. Meanwhile Disney seems to be advertising for D+ everywhere. I am hanging on for the ride.",0.9903

Competition - people are concerned that Apple's price will draw people - but Apple has been searching for a winning slate with its Apple TV for a while, and its price is good for its streaming, but its slate of products is very very limited. Disney is in transition. It could have stayed pat, producing content that the streaming venues would have tripped over each other to bid for, but it decided to go on its own - which is a worthy shot given its present content - Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar - and even more so because it can unleash its library's value. Disney had a similar choice in the 1950's - should it just keep on selling content, or start a tv channel. It choose the former, and lost the opportunity for about 40 years (and then paid a lot for ABC). It's not doing that again.This is a big job. A job carved out for Iger. And one more point - Disney doesn't see it just competing against Netflix, ATT/HBO, Amazon, Apple, CBS, NBC/Universal. Disney+ is looking towards a certain segment (people under 25), which includes Grandparents who want to entertain their grandchildren. Parents will want to watch Star Wars with their young children who want to re-experience the thrill.

Morgan analyst Alexia Quadrani penned an upbeat note on Walt Disney Co.'s (DIS) prospects in streaming on Wednesday, writing that she estimates the forthcoming Disney+ service will ultimately be able to attract 45 million subscribers domestically and 160 million subscribers in total. ""According to the U.S. government census, there are 34.5 million family households in the U.S. with children under 18, and we believe 75% of these households will eventually sign up for Disney+ due to the service's popular appeal, exclusive content, and brand recognition,"" she wrote. In addition, Quadrani expects that 30% of U.S. families without children will sign up for the service due to the presence of Marvel and Star Wars content. Internationally, Quadrani predicts that 115 million subscribers will ultimately sign up, though she warns that the growth trajectory will depend on when Disney (DIS) gets some of its content rights reverted back. She wrote that Disney's (DIS) ESPN+ streaming service has ""surpassed expectations"" with 2 million subscribers as of an announcement in early February.

1526,"Disney Longs - Change My Mind. Can we agree that SVOD is the only growing part of this business? If not, please give arguments to change my mind.The following are my key concerns with DIS.1. Theme Parks - Covid19 permanently changes behavior and this becomes a declining revenue business. (37% of DIS revenue) - Please change my mind....2. Movie Theaters (16% of revenue) - Covid19 is the last straw that pushes more movie releases to different platforms. People aren't as likely to pack into crowded theaters for a while. I believe some theaters will survive as a nostalgia play, but it will never return to normal. Change my mind.....3. Cascading effects of theater downturn will decrease the demand for SVOD because of the lack of marketing and the excitement around the opening of theater blockbusters. Streaming is the future, but I'm leaning toward AVOD, or ad-supported vs the subscription. Change my mind.....4. Hotels - How much of Disney's hotel business is tied to the theme parks?5. Cruises - I don't think the cruise industry will ever be the same. I've been on three cruises in my lifetime and I vowed to never go on one again, prior to Covid19. I'll admit I'm 6-2 and 235 pounds and I don't like small spaces. Also, I don't like buffets, so I may not be objectively looking at his. Change my mind.....6. Linear Television (ABC & ESPN) - This is the most profitable area of television, but it's in decline. SVOD & AVOD will continue to erode this business. Change my mind....7. Disney Plus is what all long investors are excited about. However, I argue that it is more reactionary and ultimately less profitable than linear television. Change my mind.....Last question: How long can Disney survive with the parks and movie theaters being closed (53% of revenue turned off)? Currently, their quick ratio is at a level that indicates risk in their ability to pay current liabilities.

There seems to be some delay. Maybe they are still coming to grips with the difficult Fox purchase, at least as to the movie studio. Maybe they are waiting for some numbers on streaming (present ongoing numbers, which won't be in the earnings, but they might want to give to boilster sentiment [which I doubt because they don't do that). But not optimistic delays.Normally, I would say that Disney is going to have great numbers this past quarter - a blockbuster that they've never had this quarter - Lion King - but the lack of stock buybacks (recently stopped), and the Fox issues, don't help.As frustrating that the Fox movies have been a victim of the delay in the merger, Disney will turn it around, Disney will have a firm entry on the older segment that they have never really had. This is worthwhile. And they will have a real streaming presence - I went on site to see what Netflix movies I might want to stream - there were over 3000, and I noted less than 20 (and I might only get to about 4) - and there might have been a total of 100 (if that much) that might be considered quality - almost all were junk. Disney+, with its Fox library, will have hit after hit. They will be light years ahead of Netflix. Yes, Netflix has some new productions, but so will Disney and Hulu.

But none of these are enough for me to continue paying a monthly fee for streaming. That brings up the question...What would make you keep paying a monthly fee for Disney streaming? They would have to offer something different than Netflix and create series or expand story telling on their popular characters and movies. They certainly have plenty of brands and franchises. I’m confident Iger and team can accomplish this.

I had Direct TV Now last summer for 3 months that it was on special. I was very satisfied with it, but switched when i could get Cable for cheaper (I've already told you too much on price, so I won't bore you more).But this is very interesting. If the DTVN format is really the Hulu format, this is a real product that can substitute for cable. You can get a nice variety of local and national channels, get ESPN, Disney and, if Disney bundles, ESPN+ and Disney+. And there is a lot about Cable losing 20 million subscribers - and this is a real issue.

They will force Comcast to sell it the other 30% soon - I think they are biding their time on Comcast, because they have a wink wink agreement because Disney didn't push the SKY deal more to wring out a little more money from Comcast (they could have refused to sell the remaining 39% Fox owned unless they upped the price).",0.99

1790,"The question, after all these numbers being bantered about,is how many subscribers does Disney actually have. Disney has said that on day one they had 10 million plus, and they aren't going to report any more until the cc on earnings. The number by Apptopia is 22 million, but that is downloads, and that may not be the same because one subscription may lead to more than one download (as each subscription allows more than one user, and users may download on more than one device). And remember that Apptopia's numbers don't include those that subscribe through Disney+.I believe Apptopia has said that there were 200 million hours on Disney+ in the last month, while Netflix had 1 billion (I don't know if the exact same time frame is being used for both, as 30 days haven't really gone by for Disney+, but I'll assume so). But that doesn't mean that Disney+ is only 20% of Netflix (assuming each subscriber spent the same amount of time each device), as Disney had no subscribers at the beginning of the month - so if it had 200 million hours of use, that might be 400 million if they had the same usage per day for the month based upon the number of users at the end of the month. So that is 40% of Netflix - and since Netflix has about 60 million subscribers, that may work out to about 24 million subscribers right now. That is a tremendous number right now. And it will grow, particularly as Christmas creates more. I think you'll have about 35 million subscribers by January 1st. And it Disney reports a number as of the cc on earnings in February, I think you'll see about 40 million. That is a tremendous amount - and I think that will push Disney to reach about 175 in February.",0.9896

What is that going to do to their bond status. Then I see a lot of posts on here about Disney plus going to pull in tons of cash.

While you drip buyers keep buy on the way down & losing more of your money ,I will be sitting on the sidelines with my profits that I took when I sold 2 weeks ago.

People that say you can't time the bottom are either lazy or don't use common sense. The bottom will be so obviously in your face, when the U.S. has a handle on the virus the bottom has hit. That will be the time to buy. The dividend won't be enough right now to cover the downward trend of the stock price to keep your shares until the bottom. Drip buyers think that they are smart to hold & add while it goes down ,but the ones that sold & took profits are the smart ones cause they haven't lost anything & can buy at anytime with more money then the drip buyers.

But don't sell yet.I am very strong on the long term nature of this stock. It will go down, and it will do up, and over the long term - 10 years, it will go up 5 - 10 times fold.But enough about the long term. I throw out the following short term scenario.Disney will give up a couple of points from today. Then it will come back, and hoover around 110 for a couple of weeks.But Disney will buy the Fox assets they want. There are simply too many economy of scales that will allow Disney to make more money. It gives them a ready stock of materials that will allow them to compete nicely with Netflix. And the Murdochs would rather own a piece of Disney than Comcast.That being said, when Disney announces the Fox purchase, it will jump about to 115. Then, some will also realize that Star Wars The Last Jedi is really another huge hit, garnering north of $1.6 billion, and also realize that Thor and Coco have garnered quite a few dollars - and we may breach 120. Then earnings will come out - another bump of $5 - we could well see 125 in February. And then we will see a slew of other movies and results that will give it a little more momentum. And when others see the ESPN app and the Disney app coming through, you will be seeing the upper 100's, and in about 2-3 years over 200. , I may be a little overly optimistic. I bought into Disney early in the 2000's, and bought in the teens. I saw some solid results, and then the drop in the fiscal crisis, a recovery, and then a solid rise from the mid 20's to the mid 120's. Then some leveling off, and even panic (remember the drop to 80 - I got in a little more then, and few other times at higher amounts). But when others complained, I felt this was no different when Disney was meandering in the 20's.

I also said that 40 million was possible. And I also said that, although official numbers would be issued by Disney until Feb, analyst numbers could move the stock price in the interim.Well, someone did come out with these numbers!!! And I think that 20 million is a given. 25 million very very likely (remember that the 15.5 number does not include subscribers from the DisneyPlus site). And 40 million still very very possible. The question I poise is whether you buy on the rumor and sell on the news? While we get some more numbers thrown around over the next few weeks, if we see Disney rise to 155, then 160, then 170, do we sell on the day earnings are announced (because they will only confirm the rumored released numbers??). As a long time long, I would not sell. Iger knows what he is doing. I've seen his meticulous mind. The only ""misstep"" is when he went on media about 4 years ago to tout Disney, particularly its movie revenues, and had to admit that cable was leveling off, and Disney ""leveled"" off. But he re-examined himself and Disney. Disney couldn't hold pat. Disney had to enter streaming, he decided. Not only did it represent the technological change media was entering, but it allowed Disney to realize the value of its immense library. Disney will not only make streaming a major money maker, but it will generate funds to buyback stock. This is only the tip of the iceberg. Disney will be 500 within 10 years - if not 1,000",0.98

1858,"This is a buying opportunity.The reason this is a buying opportunity are the reasons it is being held back. First, the ESPN and Media Issues - Disney is turning this around, steadily, by putting together a real package. It will take 2 - 3 years to put it together.Second, is the Fox (and SKY) purchase. Comcast is attempting to compete. Disney made an offer 6 months (or so) ago, that was accepted and Disney is going through the necessary processes to get it approved. Comcast made an offer at the same time, but Fox decided to go with Disney, at least because Comcast refused to provide for a break up fee – a fee in case regulators decided not to proceed. That was Comcast’s decision. They cannot have it both ways. Fox would have to wait additional time if it decided (if it could) to go with Comcast at this time. Comcast tried to buy Disney about 15 years ago, and some might argue that they are still upset that they were rebuffed.SKY might be a different issue – Comcast is trying to make a late counteroffer. Disney may have to pay extra for this. But, if anything is proven by Comcast’s actions, it is that Disney is getting a very good deal.So, this is a good time to accumulate. It is going to make $7 a share this year. More next year, whether or not all falls into place. If it doesn't all go as Iger has it planned, Disney will be making $10 a share in three years. If all goes as Iger has it planned, it will be worth a lot lot more.So, accumulate",0.9787

1903,"I usually post about movies, but I have something a little different to crow about.At Comic-Con, Disney unveiled a series of different entries from Marvel onto their streaming platform. They are very impressive - because every Marvel fan will be intent on getting them immediately - which means they will need Disney+. Remember, Avengers End Game had an opening weekend of $357 million - that is about 35 million tickets. And at least one third will want Disney+. There may be families in these numbers, and friends that will share, but this is very impressive.Going back to the ""Movies"", one other commentator has said what I have said - I suggested that Disney doubled up on hit movies this year to lead into Disney+ --- Captain Marvel , Avengers, Aladdin (somewhat of a surprise blockbuster that will break $1 billion when doing over $600 million was a relief), Toy Story 4 (perhaps not the overwhelming blockbuster that some thought it would be, but it will be over $1 billion, and may be nicely over $1.1 billion - and where are you going to be able to see ALL four Toy Story movies??), and now Lion King. Granted, Mary Poppins Returns was not the hit some hoped for, and Dumbo was a not a winner, but if you don't swing for the fences, you're not going to hit home runs.Disney is already rebounding from its poor Friday. I'm hoping that it is over 144 by earnings announcement. And then I'm hoping that we have outstanding earnings, and some more clarification on Disney+ - this could propel it over 150. A good opening of Star Wars in Disney World will also help. As we approach Disney+'s opening, may be we can approach 160. And if we can hear good things, and a good opening, that may add some fever. The Conference call in November, with another blow out quarter and fiscal year end figures may also add some real momentumAnd then we will have a cc on earnings in Feb, where Disney will have to announce its streaming results. I think Disney+ will have at least 10 million subscribers by January, 2020. That means, in my opinion, real excitement, and a price approaching, if not exceeding 200 by February 15th.And then, watch out.",0.9991

They seem to think that the extended time for the merger hurt (at least compared to the Pixar and Marvel purchases). I think that the Fox personale ""phoned it in"" during the last 18 months or so. And Disney has its hands full with creating synergies and excitement in the Fox movie and tv divisions. Eventually, they will, although it may take a couple of to four years before we see real results from these divisions.Interestingly, Disney may have gotten a break on interest on bonds being issued. Disney had a special offering on Disney+ that ran through September 2 - $140 for three years - works out less $4 a month - compared to the $6.99 a month. I'm curious how many signed up??At the cc they announced that ESPN+ had about 2.8 subscribers - I was hoping for nicely over 3 million. Maybe football season will draw them in.Disney has some work cut out for it. I think it's still cheap.

And Monday's, Tuesday's, and Wednesday' numbers were quite good. Tuesday, as Christmas Eve, is a poor day usually, but had one of the highest ever for such a day. And Christmas, perhaps the busiest movie day of the year, had the second highest ever. These are preliminary numbers (at least for Christmas), but still quite encouraging. This may have true legs. And, for what its worth. I liked it. I thought it was one of the best. Perhaps the best of this last trilogy. I think it satisfied traditional Star War fans, particularly the ones that did not like the last one, These may come back to see it again and again. Although it was a mistake that was difficult to see, they should have had the same director for all three of the last - JJ Abrams, although he may lack some originality at times, knew what this trilogy required, and either he or Disney dropped the ball in this regard.

So maybe they will try to sell 15 000 tickets?- Disney's reservation website: All dates available for half day passes (including May 11th). All dates except May 11th and 12th available for full day passes. - Disney knew park sales would be scrutinized for reopening, so I'm sure the amount of ticket actually available for sales was very limited to give that impression of high demand. https://www.shanghaidisneyresort.com/en/tickets/shdr-half-day-dated-ticket-with-meal/That nuances",0.9788

But please don't be disappointed - Toy Story, Aladdin, and even Avengers keep marching on. We will have a nice quarter announcement in August, and then in November. The interesting key for the November earnings announcement may be Ad Astra - Brad Pitt's movie done under Fox - it was moved out of May, and Disney may have a big roll in testing its promotion abilities for this type of movie. Just like Aladdin which surprised some (coming out of the rough Memorial Day Weekend) and cemented this past quarter, Ad Astra is coming in September, a month Disney has not had success, and can make the last quarter of the fiscal year wonderful.",0.9952

Users would still have the option of picking just Disney+, or just Hulu with ads, etc. But they wouldn't need to download a new app for each and would make users more willing to try out all options. Maybe call the single app Disney Digital or something similar. I'd be willing to pay $55-60/month for a bundle like that. I'd probably still keep Netflix around just for a couple of shows that we enjoy watching, but may consider canceling if the quality of shows don't get better. Especially if I would have the option of buying digital copies of Netflix shows/movies and adding that to my digital library. Just my 2 cents on the potential I see with Disney and streaming.

At that point what will be the value of your fiat currency profit that you managed to make off of a failing market and economy? The answer is fiat currency will be worthless. The federal reserve and central banks, if necessary, will inject tens of trillions of dollars into the markets and economy. They will not allow deflation to occur. Cash will become worth less and less during this process. Disney is an iconic American company.

2464,"It is quite interesting that the stock price is just over, or around the ""collar"" of the Fox transaction. For those not quite familiar, Fox shareholders are entitled to a certain amount of Disney Stock equal to $38 a share. The higher the stock price, the lower amount of shares (and conversely, the lower the Disney stock price, the higher number of shares). But there is a limit - once at 114.31 the number of shares is set (and if it goes higher, the amount of shares issued does not change). I want it to stay above 114.31, to limit dilution. I'm sure Disney wants the same (the more shares outstanding, the lower profits per share). I wonder if Disney is buying back stock to prompt the price (it had said that it was stopping its stock buyback). It is curious that the price has lingered around this number for so long. It took Disney a long time to get its number of shares down from 2 billion to 1.5. I was looking forward to seeing it at 1 billion. I don't think I'll ever see that. But I do bet that Disney starts its buybacks, at least publicly, in the next year (after it buys the remaining Hulu interests).By the way, I've had a couple of other stock exchanges recently - ATT bought my Time Warner - that was UNDER the collar price, so I got a few more shares - but the ""purchase"" price was less than originally stated because of ATT's stock price slump.

I suspect that marketing costs were $100 million - perhaps a little on the high side - but Disney did not want to have anything less than a hit - this is an advertisement /lead in for Avengers.And, for what it's worth.

It is costing Disney about $35 billion - I know you say it is about $72 billion in stock and cash, but Disney is getting the SKY $16 billion, plus it is getting about $20 billion for the local sports cable channels - that brings the price down to about $35 billion. I would even tell you that Disney is going to get more money because it will be able to repatriate money parked overseas for tax benefits, money that it might not be able to get otherwise. And this doesn't take into account other assets that Disney might sell - Draft Kings anyone?? Netflix is paying $15 billion a year for original content. They need to do this because they don't have any library. But Disney is getting Fox's library - that saves Disney $30 million over two years - yes, I know that Disney will still do some original content, but no where near $15 billion.And Disney is getting an active movie production company, channels, Hulu (30%), and other assets. Disney has said that they will be getting $2 billion in synergies a year for consolidating operations. I trust Iger. He knows what he is doing.The market is waiting on the streaming services.

I bailed on my NFLX subscription some time ago and now just share one with a family member. Yes, NFLX has a large library by this time but I find myself still watching their non-NFLX content mostly (I have found myself watching more Amazon Prime original content) and it seems their kid friendly offerings are limited. Have to imagine every home with a child will shell out for D+. Frankly, I find it amazing that anyone has time to watch all the content being pumped out between streaming, tv, etc. Personally, I would rather have a life (or something close to it) than watching endless hours of entertainment.

Everyone should learn early the value of hard work and the contributions we can make from it. Imagine if everyone followed these simple rules that are so basic for all of us. Soul is spot on ans so up lifting.

I think that the cutting of cable is stabilizing, and what Iger said three years ago is correct - ESPN has a lot of increased expenses, but the increased expenses will ease out in 2018-19. It is good because Movies pulled it down - last year they might have done $1 billion more in box office for the same period. If they had 80% of last year's box office this year, they would have blown everyone away.Someone commented that profit margin is down, with expenses increasing - yes, of course, the movies they had this year were just as expensive as last year, and they grossed less. That pulled margins down. This quarter they have two big movies - Dumbo and Captain Marvel. Next quarter, three - Avengers, Aladdin, and Toy Story. Then the next quarter they have Lion King. They just might do $8.00 a share (there is a small tax benefit in the last three quarters of the fiscal year as they average the benefit over four quarters, and only 75% of the benefit kicked in last year.And this lead to why this quarter was particularly good - last year this reporting quarter was at the old tax rate - this year's first quarter used a tax rate of 24%, opposed to last year's 31%, and the 21% they will use going forward.",0.9963

I expect the subscription will be over 60 million when it starts within 6 months. The content that DIS already has is more than enough for luring and bring in subscription. The strategy of DIS is stop NFLX and PRIME to grow and deviate to cut NFLX growth which I think it will take a few years. NFLX will have to invest even more but I think its content is not worth 12.99, so I think NFLX will deflate itself eventually.

The only thing stopping bankruptcy will be a bailout but the stock will still be worth almost nothing. I easily picture the stock in the 50s during this crisis and would not be surprised if it dropped lower. Only 2 things can stop the virus: The majority of the population gets it and builds an immunity, or a vaccine. With social distancing it will take many years for the majority of the population to build an immunity (Based on 1% death rate and 240,000 predicted dead by Anthony Fauci), this equates to them predicting 24 million of the 350 million in the US will be infected. The vaccine, as was stated, early and often by the CDC takes 18 months between development and human trials. It will take a minimum of 6 months to mass produce and deploy to 350,000,000 people in our country or 7.8 billion people around the world. Anyone speaking of a few weeks or a few months either has an agenda (Keep the stock market from tanking) or is just being optimistic because the reality is a hard pill to swallow and does not know the facts.

Estimates, before opening, were between $190 to $235 millionThe worldwide, however, went much higher. than the original estimates of $450 to just under $500 million - it has turned in $630 million as an estimate, and, this, too, can go higher (and, if one looks at Black Panther, it usually does).These global numbers are even more impressive when one considers that China and Russia haven't opened yet (2 weeks and 1 week from now, respectively). By the time it opens in China, it will be somewhere over $1 billion - maybe $1.2 billion?? This movie could easily do $1.8 billion. And maybe $2 billion is not out of the question.The Russo brothers really know how to do a movie. We owe Josh Whedon an element of thanks - he did a great job with the first Avengers, but fell a little flat with the second one - and his efforts show just how hard it is for one person to do so much - the Russo, although Disney has characterized them as tiredless and enthusiastic, demonstrate that hard it is for one person to handle this franchise.",0.99
2940,Knew they would hype the numbers. The problem is they are actually pretty slow growth on the Disney+. The 100million is the hype number. That includes all their subs from all services. Disney+ grew pretty slow over the last 2 months. Need to go back and read the previous numbers releases and factor in pandemic fueling a fire for streaming.

3013,"The weekend results for Avengers Infinity Stone are beginning to come in. And the one that means the most is China. China's opening day, Friday, was about $70 million. That means about $200 million by the end of the weekend there alone.In the US it is somewhere between $55 to 62. Mothers Day may be hurting it a little. I say ""hurting"" because it has been running a few dollars more than Black Panther the last week or so, and it will probably fall short of Black Panther's third weekend amount of $66 million. Avengers had a lead over BP of just over $50 million yesterday. Black Panther will wind up with about $705 million (It had over $694 m as of yesterday, and is on its last legs. but Black Panther had very very very good legs, with little competition, and a bump from, ironically, Avengers. Avengers has a lot of competition, including Disney's Hans Solo - but maybe it can glean some nice money over the summer. In any case it should break $700 million, and be around $750 unless it collapses.China's opening day of $70 means an opening weekend of about $200 million, and a final number of over $300 million. Add that $300 to this weekend final numbers of a probable $1.45 billion (w/o China), and you have $1.75 billion. That means $1.85 billion is a given, and $2 billion very very very likely. I think you will see a final number of $2.15 billion.The interesting number popping up is India - which is nearly $40 million as we speak. That beats Jungle Book. And it means that India is becoming a market. With a billion or so people, it has a potential market of competing with China - think adding $150 million per picture to each Disney's movie. And maybe India can be a focus for the next Disney World project. Add Africa in, and you are doubling Disney's foot print in the long term. In a world looking for more and more leisure and entertainment, there is no better outlet for such wholesome entertainment, something that families crave.In the short term, last year for this quarter, Disney had three movies that garnered box office numbers that totaled $2 billion. Avengers, alone, will beat that number. $4 billion for Avengers, Solo, and Incredibles is looking more and more likely, and something nicely over that is looking like a possibility. Disney has been stashing away cash of late (as opposed to buying back stock), due to the Fox purchase, higher streaming cost startups, and paying down debt which has increasing interest rates. But maybe they will use some of this to buy back more stock. Next quarter will break $2 a share in profit. Easy. The only question is how much, how much will roll over into the 4th quarter, and how much the final year number will be - I've been consistent at $7 a share, and I'm sticking by it.",0.9968

Here is where I'm having trouble seeing DIS stock moving much higher... I realize that parks and studios are doing great. But let's face it, the story of this stock is about streaming. It has been since ESPN subscribers started jumping ship. So if we take the current projections that DIS will have 160M subscribers in 3 years, we can do some quick math. In comparison, NFLX has 149M subscribers now, so the following math assumes DIS surpasses NFLX, which I believe is very possible, but is as rosy a projection as we could reasonably apply at this time. Anyway, at $7 a month, DIS will be adding approx $1.1B in revenue every month. That's $13.4B a year. DIS currently makes $60B in revenue a year, so we're looking at a 22.5% tailwind for the stock. I bought the stock at $104 and sold it at $145, making roughly 40%. I understand that there may be additional revenue growth from both the parks and studio divisons.",0.994

3075,"The quarter has ended, and it is my turn to give you some earnings prediction for the next quarter.I use the same quarter from last year as a basis. I compare the various segments.Last year Disney made $1.95 a share. The first segment I will look at is Parks – they are as busy as ever, and then more. They have increase prices. They have opened Star Wars at Disney World, and nothing is stopping them – add 10 cents.TV/Media: ESPN has been pulling it down. ABC et al has been exploding. But ESPN has leveled its expenses. And cable cord cutters may be leveling off. I’m going to add 5 cents.Movies – through the roof. Last year they had Avengers, then Star Wars Solo (a dud), and then The Incredibles. As much as it seemed impossible, End Game beat its predecessor by about $700 million, and then Aladdin broke the Memorial Day jinx for Disney. Ironically Toy Story is not beating the Incredibles’ numbers, but I’m going to ignore this. Also Dumbo had a chance to add some real income opening at the end of the prior quarter, but may still add. X-men hurt, reeling in a otherwise fantastic quarter. Video releases may be limited too, but I am also going to ignore that. I am going to add 25 cents. Royalties/license fees – Avengers had a record $150 million, and then Toy Story matched it (or close to it), and I don’t think that includes the toys sold through licensing. And then add Aladdin. And nearly all of this is profit. I would suggest that you add 10 cents.That would give you $2.45 cents a share. But Disney said at the last cc that there were Fox dilution and streaming costs of about 70 – 75 cents a quarter. But I think that is just too much. I think it’ll be about 50 cents. That means about $1.95.But really think that Disney is trying to make as much as it can on a quarter to quarter basis. Before, Disney had reasons to keep earnings down just a little. Maybe they were trying to avoid anti-competition issues in trying to get SEC approvals and the like. Maybe there were other subtle issues, such as timing and taxes (on this last issue, they are using a lower rate than last year due to tax law changes). But now all gloves are off. Add 25 cents.

I also tend to look at an SP valuation based on future forecast projections to that of the street ....so if DIS was at 116 pre-streaming announcement last April my ? is at what SP price point does the market essentially say ""hold the line"" on the stock. If you recall DIS tended to become quite the safe haven to hold during recent spike downturns in the market over this past year (specifically), so now you have a ""flu bug"" being manipulated via the world wide web, a CEO who wants to ficus on the new streaming business which officially puts Disney in a hybrid crossover entertainment - media tech industry(s),and keep in-mind I am saving the best part of my personal analysis/theory for very last ""The world loves Walt Disney and the world will absolutely confirm that over the next 3 months when the subs double+ what we have already in the US > hint 29 million .......so average down because its the 800 lb gorillas in any industry which will always recover first/fastest during these 2001/02, 2008/09, 3rd/4th Q 2014, etc.....",0.8865

3098,"This is really quite overwhelming. Having been boosted by the wonderful presentation at investors' day, Avengers End Game exceeded even lofty predictions - it may even hit $330 domestic, and over $1 billion worldwide is a given (at least in my opinion). This has propelled it this week from the low 130's, to just short of 140 (and after hours has it up another point to almost 141). You have another event in about 10 days - earnings. Analysts have it pegged to around 1.58 - last year it 1.84. But this year we have a lot more headwinds, and Disney has told this quite clearly (primarily movie timings and sales of dvd's). Disney does have continued strength in parks as a positive, and some tax benefits. But I am worried that they might disappoint - but we will see how the market reacts - it may be that they really don't care. And, if Disney is on the plus side, they will run higher. But we may finally have a run on Disney. I, personally, believe that investors want to invest in Disney - it is a nice wholesome producer or products, and find it a safe haven, but want the ""hot"" stock while Disney might be considered ""boring"". But boring no longer!!! And, if it runs to 150 next week, gets some boost from earnings, sees good openings for Aladdin and Toy Story, and then a good opening for the Star Wars Park in California, we could see 160 - 170. Then, you might see some boosts from Lion King, and a wonderful report for the April - June quarter. This may put it into 170 - 180. When Disney Plus opens, and if it opens well, you will be pressing 200. If it can break 200, you have a stock approaching the Apple / Amazon models. But Disney, unlike those companies, have real assets and real income.This has been a very satisfying two weeks, I rode Disney from the teens till now.

3144,"Yes, Walt Disney just reported a bad quarter. Yes, the miss was almost entirely due to worse-than-expected performance at Disney ’s newly acquired 21st Century Fox properties.But nothing has changed in the part of Disney ’s future that matters most for investors: its direct-to-consumer streaming potential. The outlook there is still upbeat, and so is our view on the stock. Barron’s has long been bullish. (See “Working More Magic at Disney,” Dec. 28, 2018; the shares have returned 30.5% since then, versus 19.6% for the broad market.)On Tuesday evening, Disney posted fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenue below analysts’ expectations, sending its stock (ticker: DIS) down nearly 5% the following day. The biggest shortfall to estimates came from poor performance at the newly incorporated TV networks, film studios, and international brands that Disney acquired from 21st Century Fox in late March. ( Fox [FOXA] and Barron’s parent company, News Corp [NWSA], have common ownership.)The addition pushed Disney’s third-quarter sales up 33% from the same period a year ago, to $20.2 billion, but the new assets didn’t earn as much as Wall Street had expected. They cost Disney 60 cents per share in its third quarter, versus guidance of a 35-cent drag. Disney’s overall earnings came in 22% below consensus at $1.35 per share.But 21st Century Fox is just one part of the Disney story, and there’s no new reason to doubt the long-term bullish case for the stock. Disney’s deep and valuable content library, its global brand, and its ambitious approach to direct-to-consumer streaming have set it up for continued success in both its legacy and new businesses. And Disney management repeated its prior forecast that the 21st Century Fox deal would add to Disney’s earnings per share in fiscal 2021 when big cost savings kick in.“In our view, the investment thesis is the same, and if we liked the stock before earnings, we love it on any weakness,” J.P. Morgan analyst Alexia Quadrani wrote after Disney’s earnings. “With so many moving pieces between the newly acquired Fox and Disney+ launch, there are bound to be some hits and misses each quarter.”She sees November’s launch of the Disney+ streaming service as a catalyst for the stock and reiterated her Overweight rating and $150 price target—about 8% above the recent $139.20.",0.9969

DOJ that is opposing TWX/AT&T deal part of Trump and US Govnt.2) Murdock family and FOX shareholders prefer to own DIS stock instead of CMCSA. Perceived better long term value 3) DIS has foot in the door already. Iger has met with Murdock’s and top FOX executives and has already applied for regulatory approval. Yes, there have been deals like this in the past where someone swooped in and stole target company from original acquirer. I don’t see this happening here.4) DIS could easily match or top any rival bid from Comcast given its strong liquidity and underlevered balance sheet.5) Stronger and Natural Synergies with DIS/FOX deal (ie Avatar, Star Wars and Marvel)6) Even if TWX/AT&T deal goes through, a DIS/FOX deal would still go through less scrutiny than CMCSA/FOX deal 7) TWX/AT&T could challenge and unfavorable court ruling in March 2018 which could delay a final decision for over a year, at which point DIS/FOX deal may be close to already received all regulatory approvals.",0.9902

3221,"Disney vs. Comcast: Who will win FOX? Th battle will begin tomorrow when federal judge Leon rules on the AT&T Time Warner deal tomorrow. DIS stock action past few days suggests the smart money thinks judge may rule against the AT&T Time Warner deal and as a result there will be no competing bid from Comcast. Or, that DIS will ultimately win a bidding war for FOX that won’t be too dilutive. I don’t see any way that Comcast would win Fox over Disney. Curious to here others thoughts 1) Murdock’s prefer Disney are are large shareholders/voting power. Rupert would rather chew glass then sell to Comcast.2) DIS is better strategic fit (Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar, ESPN) and best in class at monitoring content across its vast media empire. 3) DIS all stock offer is a tax free spin to FOX shareholders. Comcast’s all cash offer would be a tax event. 4) DIS has a 6 month head start over Comcast on Regulatory approval.6) DIS has balance sheet strength, cash and liquidity to win a bidding war. I guarantee DIS will match or exceed CMCSA bid 7)Trump showed his support by congratulating Rupert Murdock when the deal was announced. Yes, Trump is not the DOJ but his opinion does have value. Look at AT&T trial...Trump was public ally against this deal.9) DIS has no bad history with DOJ and clearer path to regulatory approval. The DOJ does not like CMCSA...much more difficult path to regulatory approval. 10)On 6/7/18, DOJ issued comment saying that DIS used precision in structuring its deal for FOX from a regulatory perspective. This removes regulatory uncertainty. 11)) DIS has lined up cash financing in event FOX board demands some cash to counter a bid from Comcast.",0.963

If either of these numbers expand a little, that will help it break $850 million - but that will be tough given the competition from Justice League, and then Star Wars.Coco seems to be coming on strong. It is tracking behind Moana, but its reviews are very strong, and the movie goers seem to love it. It may be hurting a little from Wonder's wonderful showing - and kudos to this family movie.

3370,"Does anyone know why Disney is moving today? And remember this, it is really around 145 as I speak because it just went ex-dividend.I, personally, think it is getting a little ahead of itself. There is nothing really to move it - a good Lion King opening should be priced in, and is offset by not a crazy box office for Toy Story (at least domestically - it's breaking records in Latin America). But the movie box office is not the mover that it use to be either. (Aladdin is still moving nicely, but its at its tail end). Earnings are a few weeks away - maybe there was a consensus that it really is going to blow things out of the water.Streaming is still about 4 months away - but maybe there is some anticipation for some announcement during the earnings cc.I think a break out over 150 is unlikely until we wee what the signups for Disney+ are. But, I do think that that will trigger a run over 175. And if it breaks 210, then you might see a run to over 300.

When all is said, Comcast may have to pay an additional premium for Disney's portion of Sky, and Disney will give Comcast between $1 billion to $2 billion for the remaining interest in Hulu.Disney will have three streaming entities - ESPN+, Disney, and Hulu. I think they may even break up the Disney into different portions (think animation, Marvel, and Star Wars). It will give consumers the option of bunching them together for one price, or purchasing them separately. By 2025 Disney will have 100 million subscribers for its streaming, ranging from $5/month to $30 per month - it will be grossing about $10 - 15 billion a year.

They apparently have been planning this for a while to give new Bob some on the job training with Iger leading the creative vision. Why today? Who knows specifically. I'd speculate it's a good time to embrace the drop that already happened instead of taking a major drop twice. It could be everything was just finalized. Iger repeatedly mentioned determining creative vision and having a lot of work to do in that capacity before retirement. Sounds like he's mapping out things for the long term particularly with content (as that's not new Bob's speciality).

I was most concerned that Cars 3 was off the mark - perhaps because of Mr. Lassiter's infatuation with cars which clouded his decisions to put this sequel forth (although the marketing of toys may have played a real role) - perhaps this will give him an opportunity to put some things in perspective and give some renewed innovation of an element of the Disney movie studios that has been a strength for so many years.",0.9781

This will put Disney in the upper teens (plus 100).Disney has an Investor's say in early April. They will have momentum from Captain Marvel and Dumbo. They will show wonderful things for Disney+, and probably have an closing date for Fox and a date for Disney+'s availability. A lot of excitement will build. You may see 120 breached again. Then we have earnings for the second quarter announced in early May. They won't be very good. But they will beat estimates. And Avengers will be doing gangbusters. It will hopefully hold over 120.We will then see Disney+ introduced. If we hear good numbers, it will begin to rise. The third quarter's results will be announced in August - they will be very very good - maybe over $2.25 - it will have Avengers, Aladdin, and Toy Story results, plus most of Dumbo's box office will fall in this quarter (with its expenses already attributed to the prior quarter).

""In my three decades in children's programming, I have witnessed kid's television evolve from Saturday morning network with shows such as Scooby Doo and the Smurfs, to 1 run syndication with shows like Inspector Gadget and He Man, to dedicated cable channels (Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network) to digital platforms ranging from Netflix, Hulu, and Disney +, to game platforms, mobile, YouTube, and all of the new and emerging technologies. Throughout the above, I am not aware of seeing another channel launch with such a volume of content, across such a broad range of platforms, penetrating virtually the entire United States TV Household universe. We are loading our episodes as fast as possible across all platforms and expect to have over 4,000 episodes available by the end of this month. Similarly, we will expect all of our platforms to be rolling out with full delivery in the coming days."" ('where to watch' link information below)Among the initial 1,000 episodes of entertaining and enriching content offered on Kartoon Channel! is the animated short feature, The Pig On The Hill (see link below), narrated by Pierce Brosnan; the hugely successful Angry Birds series, from the billion-dollar franchise; Baby Einstein and the Baby Einstein shorts, as well as Llama Llama shorts, and the Minecraft-themed show, Journey to the End. The upcoming comedy-adventure series, Stan Lee's Superhero Kindergarten, currently in pre-production and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, will debut on Kartoon Channel! in Q1 2021.Heyward continued, ""A volume of content this large is not simply 'flipping a light switch'. That is particularly so when we vet every single episode to make sure that it is compliant with our programming code developed by Stanford University Professor Emeritus Don Roberts, with whom Kartoon Channel!'s Program Code was developed in order to ensure the delivery of positive purposeful content that parents can always know will provide safe viewing for their children.""Currently, Kartoon Channel! can be accessed via Apple TV Devices, Android (mobile devices), Android TV, Amazon Fire Stick, Roku Devices, Xumo, Dish (AVOD + SVOD), Sling (AVOD + SVOD). The Company's other platforms are rolling out as fast as the content can be loaded. (see link below for access on various platforms)""Having produced and broadcast thousands of children's episodes across a number of the kids networks, we wanted to make Kartoon Channel! stand out as a brand, not just because it is free and available to everyone, but by putting on shows, which tell positive stories. That is very very important to us,"" said Kartoon Channel! Executive Chairman, Margaret Loesch.""Kids and their parents want uplifting stories. They want positive messages,"" added Heyward. ""It is also important to us that Kartoon Channel! is free and available to everyone. It is no less important that the stories are positive and with enriching lessons, whenever possible.""""Representative of the original shows that we are proud of and which will differentiate Kartoon Channel! is 'The Pig on a Hill', narrated by Pierce Brosnan. It is a fantastic story, and without ever saying so, it is about kindness, and it is about getting along with people different than ourselves. We are going to be a positive channel, and not just a babysitter with a screen on it.""",0.9978

I thought, after the first weekend's initial domestic numbers, it could approach $2 billion, and certainly have a good chance to hit 1.8 billion - before the opening, I was looking at just over 1.6 billion (a traditional 20% off for a sequel).Then, the overseas first weekend numbers, although good, weren't quite as good as the domestic first weekend's. And the domestic numbers from the first weekend weren't adjusted upwards much, which was a little surprising. And then the weekday figures seemed to be off from SWTFA by a fair amount (although there were more schools closed this time around). And then a vocal minority expressed disappointment because the hopeful theme seemed to be replaced by some humor. And now China has been disappointing in its opening.This movie is still going to do $1.4, maybe 1.5 billion. It may have made a misstep in abandoning some themes to a certain extent. But I think that J.J. Abrams will get it right, Disney will take a few years off with the next ""trilogy"" to build up interest (and it will have a few Avatar movies to promote in the interim) and to get it really right. Remember that Return of the Jedi was not favorable received, but is considered the best of all the SW movies.I do think some of the themes, instead of the humor, could have done better. But it should not be considered a failure.And China is disappointing. but this isn't quite their genre. It is particularly disappointing because this would otherwise be a very nice market. But the force is strong elsewhere, and we can't be winners everywhere. Maybe, somewhere in another time, China will warm up to SW. And, remember this, as disappointing as SW is in China, Disney gets a small part of the gross sales in China, and Shanghai Disney isn't hurting for the moment.But let's look on the bright side - It will do about $1.5 billion - how many movies have done that amount?? Thor has done quite well - it will finish with just over $850 million. Coco will do over $700 million, and has done very very nicely overseas - particularly China - and this success in China (over $180 million) gives hope to the Pixar franchise which, until Coco, has never done well - so this bodes well for other Pixar titles, particularly The Incredibles 2, which is on deck in June - this could be very very nice. The first three titles of the year will gross over $3 billion. And Disney's slate of movies remains very very strong.",0.9981

3906,"I just want to be clear. Disney had 1.89 in earnings in the first quarter (beating by 28 cents). This quarter has been upped to 1.68 a few weeks ago. The next quarter is 1.98, and the total for the year is 6.91. These numbers are TOO LOW.Black Panther is simply one of the best movies. At the end of the weekend, domestic, it is going to be between $390 to $400 million, with a $100 million weekend. Four weeks ago, I thought anything over $300 million would be a huge victor, and, maybe, 3 weeks ago I thought $400 million could be a possibility. Now, $600 million is not out of the question, and over $1 billion looks more and more likely. This movie, 4 months ago, was a maybe $500 million total gross worldwide.Add 2 cents in profits for each $100 million. That is another 10 -14 cents. That means we are looking at about 1.80 for this quarter. May/June has three blockbusters scheduled – if they all hit, and BP is a good harbinger, Disney will see more than $2.00 That is $5.70 (and I think it may be a little more than that) before the fourth quarter. Now, the fourth quarter is not Disney's best – but they do have the Ant Man on board in July, which will give it a nice boost.The only thing that might hurt is A Wrinkle in Time, which, if it falls, it will hurt. Oprah will not let that happen.What I am saying is that Disney is going to make $7 a share. At 20 pe, that is $140 a share. That is why Disney is worth it.

On the low end, these total $510, on the high end, 610. Let's say $550. The add $50 each for South Korea and UK - that will give you $650. Then there are about 6 countries that can average 25 - France, Germany, Austalia, Brazil, Mexico, the Philippines - that puts you at $800. then there are close to 10 countries that can do $10 million - that puts you at 900. Then there are about 20 countries that can average 3- 4 million - let's say that puts you at about $975. Then you have to glean a little more somewhere to hit $1 billion.

This debt is probably at a higher interest rate than what is routine or what Disney pays. I speculate that the money that they are saving from buying back more stock or paying more dividends will go to pay down this high interest rate debt.They could use the extra money to put into capital expenditures and related items, but they seem to be at a consistent rate (they have put a lot into Shanghai, which, with its opening, has, presumably, gone down, allowing for improvements in the US which have increased).

4231,"I think we need a little realty. Disney does seem to have made a nice level just over 140. It revisited the highs of about a week ago, and even exceeded them for a few minutes on Tuesday, but couldn't hold them. I'm not one for technical numbers, but it seems to have a base of 140 for the moment. Can it move much higher? Not much for the next few months. Maybe Toy Story can cause a pop IF it breaks $200 million for an opening weekend (it seems to be around $165 million, which really isn't too shabby). And maybe Lion King can move it, but only with its own $200 million plus opening weekend. - We're really lucky if it exceeds 145 because of these two items, and I doubt that because movies are not the immediate movers they once were.Earnings report in early August? I think that an unadjusted number (without streaming preparation costs and Fox costs) of $2.40 - $2.50 is possible. But, as nice as this is (as it will begin to put a down payment on the Fox costs, thereby reducing interest costs), the real news that could help is the streaming news - specifically a date for the opening of Disney+ and a date that people can sign up for Disney+. This certainty could add 5 points. But with all this, it is only possible for Disney to reach the high 140's (although staying over 140 should be considered a nice achievement).The real even is November's opening of Disney+ . Will signups be significant? (5 - 10 million by the end of December would be a nice accomplishment, and I think 10 - 20 million is a possibility). Will Disney have a few new shows just for Disney+ when it opens? - this ""teaser"" seemed to move Disney in April. If Disney dips under 137.5, it may be worth picking up more. I'm kicking myself for not picking up a little more at 108 back in March.",0.9976

4245,"For everybody concernced about the Disney+ (the new streaming platform).Right now 46% of disney revenue comes from media networks. That amounts for $23.5billion. $16.5b comes from cable networks (disney channels and espn) and the other $6.9b from broadcasting (abc group and radio networks). AnalysisThe cable networks are divided between ESPN and Disney Channels (xd, junior and the normal one.) ESPN has and audience of aprox 80 millions usersDisney Channel has and audience of 90 million in the USA and another 130million internationally.Taking out ESPN and focusing on the Disney channels, the disney channels rack up aprox $10-12b from that revenue. That means that at a price of 7.99$ x suscription, the disney channel would need 104 million suscribers to match that revenue (half of what they currently have on the network tv channels)ConclusionDisney channels are now currently watched by kids only but diseny is planning to put franchises like star wars and captain america, and nat geo, which would potentially increase the audience to nerds and long time fans of the series. Plus: Netflix is trading at 132 times their earnings. This is because investors think that netflix can penetrate markets like china and india, which they clearly havn't been able to do. Disney will, because all the movies they make are huge $1b+ box offices around the world.This means that when disney+ gets out netflix will have to pour even more money to create content and report losses to compete, while disney already has a ton of premium content, plus all the content from 21 fox century. When the contracts are up, why would tv shows and movies be on netflix when disney is taking over? Comapanies will switch and netflix in 2 years will be absolete.",0.9863

Comcast’s all cash offer would be a tax event. 4) DIS has a 6 month head start over Comcast on Regulatory approval.6) DIS has balance sheet strength, cash and liquidity to win a bidding war.

I thought that a worldwide opening weekend of $850 million was optimistic, and I criticized someone for suggesting $1 billion, but I think that is very possible. China could easily break $200 million (Avengers Infinity was $199 million), and it is a 5 day weekend there. I think $300 million is possible in the US (I just checked my local theater, and they have 23 showings on Thursday, and 21 are essentially sold out - the 1:00 a.m. and 1:15 are very empty, but I think they just added them). I think the US and China numbers could total $550 million. I think the UK and South Korea could add $50 million each. And then Brazil, France Germany, Mexico, Russia, Australia, Philippines, and India could average at least $25 million each. That gives you $850 million alone. It may be be difficult to glean the rest elsewhere, and it really has to break the numbers mentioned above, but $1 billion is not out of the question.

I've taken the position that Disney is a company for the ages, will provide entertainment through various channels for a world that will have more and more emphasis on entertainment in an expanding worldwide economy - it would only be jeopardized if there were some worldwide catastrophe.Ten days ago I liquidated my entire retirement portfolios; because: (i) we were facing a worldwide catastrophe, (ii) I couldn't put my family's future at risk, (iii) the news was going to get worse and worse, only adding pressure on the markets, (iv) whenever I've seen this played out in the past (1987, 2001, 2008), the loss wasn't just in the first few days, but over the months to come (and we were into this for only about 2 weeks), and (v) I believed that our President did not have the capacity act competently (I don't mean this politically, but objectively - his demeanor is set by his headstrong attitude, which is not consistent with good management in a crisis - even after his change in tone (widely complimented) in the last day, he still rated himself a 10 (not a humble position), referred to the virus as a ""China"" virus, and blamed China). I was a little tempted to go back into Disney when it was under 80 for a few moments today - but it is very hard to catch a falling knife. I think the Dow will hit 17,500, and stabilize there. If I'm right, you could see Disney revisit 80, and probably 75 - if real panic sets in, 50 is a possibility.But things will return. People will go to the Parks and Movies.

In its first two weeks, the Disney+ app tallied 15.5 million downloads and $5 million worth of in-app purchases driven by hype around the Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) content library and the launch of ""The Mandalorian."" By some estimates, it’s continued to accrue another 1 million new subscribers daily.“The huge initial numbers continue to show that Disney+ will be a significant competitor to Netflix,” Feinseth wrote.In its 11 years in business, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has accrued 60 million paid U.S. subscribers and 97 million international subscribers.“The strong initial results of Disney+ means it could easily exceed its initial 60-90 million subscribers forecast much earlier than its initial 2024 target,” Feinseth said.Investors see great potential in the young streaming service. Since launching Disney+ on Nov. 12, Disney has risen 9.4% to an all-time high. Netflix appears undaunted. It has spiked more than 7% in the same time.Why It's Important For DisneyFeinseth expects Disney to sustain its run and continues to recommend purchase, partly because the effects of Disney+ are not isolated. The Disney+ craze has boosted sales across the company portfolio. Hulu app downloads have risen 55% and ESPN+ 50%. To Feinseth, the across-the-board surge suggests more consumers are selecting Disney’s $13 bundle package instead of the $7 standalone Disney+ subscription.“Most importantly, I believe the success of Disney+ will also drive merchandise sales, park visits, cruises, increasing other business through its massive halo effect,” Feinseth wrote. “I believe that Baby Yoda, along with other Mandalorian action figures will be in huge demand.”Disney's stock traded around $151.64 at time of publication.Related Links:Disney+ Accounts Reportedly Hacked, Sold On The Dark WebHow Trader Sentiment On Streaming Stocks Has Changed Since Disney+ LaunchPhoto courtesy of Disney.Copyright  2019 Benzinga (BZ Newswire, http://www.benzinga.com/licensing).

While Disney doesn't receive any box-office money from the film, it does still own the merchandising rights to the character — toys, clothing tie-ins and other merchandise all go into Disney's pocket.On Sunday, Sony reported that ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" had earned $847 million globally.

They rake in massive amounts of money per month, still one source of income, makes this now media company, a little more prone to negative market conditions, Disney, doesn't have to worry about that.

Add in the local sports networks, that is at least $15 billion, and I think $20+ is very possible. And then add in the other assets Disney is selling. And remember, that Disney has been stockpiling some money of late because it hasn't been doing stock buybacks (at least they haven't been telling us they haven't - the cynic in me says that Disney is buying at least a few shares in the past month. But I'm not really worried. Disney, in effect, is doing a stock buyback when they pay cash instead of stock for the Fox purchase.
