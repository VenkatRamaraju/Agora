So I think a tax increase would hit the company hard. I'm very interested in how the company will pay back the current liabilities this year without having much cash (both current and quick ration fell below 1). I don't really understand the rational behind buying shares back when the P/E ratio was around 30... and doing that on debt and sacrificing the majority of its cash reserves. Without the buyback, EPS would've been 10% lower. So what will the company do to pay pack the current liabilities? Issue shares on dropped price that it bought back when it was more expensive last year? Or issue even more bonds and increase it's debt/asset to 50+%?

1566,"Illegal immigrant kills NFL star on Super Bowl SundayFEBRUARY 5, 2018Indianapolis Colts lineback Edwin Jackson was one of the two men struck and killed by a truck on Super Bowl Sunday — and the suspect is a twice-deported illegal alien.Another American life ended tragically by a criminal that should have never been in our country, outraged fans say.Jackson and another man were killed early Sunday when a suspected drunken driver struck them as they stood outside their car along a highway in Indianapolis, the team and police said.“The loss of life at the hands of illegal immigrant criminals should make all Hoosiers sad and ultimately angry. We must do more to get these dangerous illegal immigrant criminals off of our streets, and guarantee this never happens again by building a wall, ending sanctuary cities, and stopping illegal immigration once and for all,” Indiana Rep. Todd Rokita said in a statement.The Colts said in a statement Sunday that the team is “heartbroken” by Jackson’s death and that the 26-year-old “was loved by all in the Colts organization.”State police identified the victims as Jackson, who grew up in Atlanta, and 54-year-old Jeffrey Monroe, of Avon, Indiana. Police say they were killed when a suspected drunken driver — who is also an illegal alien –struck them as they stood outside their car along Interstate 70 on Indianapolis’ west side.Police said that it’s believed that Monroe was an Uber driver who was transporting Jackson when Jackson became ill. Monroe pulled over to the side of the highway and got out to help Jackson when both were struck by a pickup truck that also hit Monroe’s car, police said.The pickup’s driver, a 37-year-old illegal immigrant named Manuel Orrego-Savala, is a citizen of Guatemala and had been deported twice before. Orrego-Savala was believed to be intoxicated and was driving without a license, police said. He allegedly tried to flee the deadly scene on foot but was quickly captured.“Orrego-Savala is in the United States illegally and has previously been deported on two occasions, in 2007 and again in 2009. State police investigators are working with U.S. Federal Immigration Officials and they have placed a hold on Orrego-Savala,” Sgt. John Perrine said in a statement.The 6-foot, 234-pound Jackson attended Georgia Southern. He was signed by the Arizona Cardinals in May 2015 and released by the team about three months later. Jackson was signed to the Colts in December 2015. He was placed on injured reserve by the Colts last September.The Colts said in their statement that they “admired” Jackson’s “outgoing personality, competitive spirit and hard-working mentality.”“He was well-respected among all with whom he crossed paths, and he will be greatly missed in our locker room and throughout our entire organization,”",0.4936

If you exhaust the top 10% of the “white” pool you begin to hire lesser quality staff. Being vocal and aggressive about diversity should attract all sorts of people. Thus you get exposure to the broader top 10% base. The idea isn’t to just hire a black person or Asian person, but rather, to attractive more top tier applicants. This notion was explained to me from a close friend who advocates for Aboriginals to get involved in science, especially aerospace (as he’s an aerospace engineer).

Many in the investment industry (some may now be at SEC and later be back ""on the Street"") have probably dined in one or more Danny Meyer's fine-dining Union Square Hospitality Group (USHG) 20+ NYC restaurants, and would like to do so again when some or all of them reopen; also Meyer is sitting on several boards of companies with potential IPO and some that will certainly need WS help with raising money through loans and/or other financial services that WS lives on (just like recent recap via dilution of $SHAK) and he is also involved in some feel-good non-profits and restaurant / farming community organizations. Maybe that's why they have been so brazen about it, they may feel at best ignored and at worst untouchable.That's why Meyer's USHG and Shake Shack share the similar marketing theme (easy to search): ""Union Square Hospitality Group's BELOVED restaurants, cafes, and bars..."" / ""Union Square Hospitality Group has created some of New York's most BELOVED restaurants, cafes, bars..."" / ""USHG is the hospitality company founded by Danny Meyer, and owner of some of New York City's most BELOVED restaurants."" / ""We love to reimagine BELOVED, classic dishes..."" / ""The (fill in the city) Shack serves up all the BELOVED Shake Shack classics..."" etc. etc. - it's in their 10Ks, 10Qs annual reports and all marketing literature. ""Iconic"" and ""cult"" are other monikers they use - that's how you sell inferior products at higher prices to tourists and brand-curious, and that's why they need high-traffic places like malls and terminals, stadiums to attract casual traffic and sustain high AUV - but their retainment rate is low, 75% of first-time visitors never come back, so expenses are high, gross and the net margins are low and the business model at these high valuations is not sustainable over long term.5. Now, an article about ridiculous valuations and of these WS + SHAK insiders stock shenanigans in highly regarded financial publication(s) or a statement by a well-known short-seller would go a long way to get attention of SEC / FinCEN, but in this environment of The Fed and Fed gov't flooding the market with trillions of dollars to bail out ""the market"" and ""leave no zombie company behind"" it's not a sure thing that it will turn into something concrete. After 2007-2008 GFC market crash and unraveling of Madoff's decades-long Ponzi scheme operation a lot of mini-Madoffs were uncovered and busted... I guess we are still some ways from Zombie Companies Apocalypse, staved off by Trillions of dollars, some flowing to companies that should be saved while most going to WS Mafia Laundromats ""washing"" money through entities like $SHAK and some other zombies, with insiders sharing in the booty.I and a few others on this board (and some articles in Forbes, SeekingAlpha, etc.) have been documenting for more than a year this financial engineering fraud and the ""love story"" between WS Mafia and SHAK insiders and there are enough forensic accounting evidence to bring this to logical conclusion - the question is, would anyone blow the whistle loud enough for SEC or FinCEN to wake up and do their jobs? Shake Shack CFO (""Chief Financial Engineering Officer"") Tara Comonte was promoted to President in the beginning of this year - ever wondered why? CFO + President is unusual and rare; CEO + Pres, Pres + COO, CEO + COO are much more common. Randy Garutti is completely incompetent as CEO flailing in different directions, trying one failed scheme after another (GrubHub exclusivity, trying to emulate Chipotlane with pretty ""Jetsons""-like sketches, ""digital ecosystem"" etc.), he is just a marketing cheerleader spouting usual slogans ""brand,"" ""opportunity for growth"" and ""I don't care about margins, I just want to sell more burgers - that brings in cash"" on ERs, ""investor conferences"" and CNBC.Well, we'll find out next week if only 1,666 left open from last $55 LIMIT order have been filled... or maybe they used the opportunity today to also ""park"" another 25K shares for Danny Meyer, on no-news low-vol day with $SHAK ""somehow"" being up nearly 3% during the day while $CMG, $MCD, $WEN, $QSR, $SBUX etc. were all down or just barely in the green at the same time?",0.9996

I suppose I will have to wait for the this Qs earnings report for evidence that this apparent boycott was effective. As an investor holding shares in SBUX it is ALL about China. A store being opened every day in a market that dwarfs the USA. The CEO should know that business and politics rarely mix. My respect for him as dropped significantly, however, my interest in SBUX share has not been diminished because unlike the lemmings on this board who are SO insulted that Shultz has some stupid affinity for refugees, I recognize the fact that the USA is no longer the center of the ""consumption"" universe. Besides, I hate to profile, but much of the traffic in the stores looks like it leans left anyway. Many of those on this board complaining about Shultz throwing a few bones to refugees probably prefer truck stop coffee and conversation anyway.

That final point I cannot stress enough.I'll be loading every red day until I have a couple thousand shares. I'm most interested to see what their new audited financials show, I know some people are weary, but this company reminds me of $SBUX back in '08, after it got beat down on worries about profitability following restructuring and expansion. Post the 75% drop in SP $SBUX jumped 2000% to present day. It's good to see the board being restructured and it gives me hope we'll see LK back on the NASDAQ some day.Right now I'm thinking there's a similar consolidation period of massive institutions looking into and buying LKNCY, very similar to NIO after it got hammered down thanks to bankruptcy worries. Barclays & BlackRock both own ~1,000,000 shares, and I expect more major institutions to buy in shortly following some major red days.

The last 3 years the stock went sideways but kept pace with valuation as growth slowed and trialing p/e came down to match. The numbers I use value the stock at $71-73, but China growth concerns suppress demand. If Starbucks hits expectations next Thursday look for it to break $70. And if next quarter stays the course look for $78. If and when China goes throttle-up watch p/e and a return to 20% y-o-y growth. The 2% dividend makes it easier, too. When rev growth is 10% and earnings growth is 20%, trailing p/e 29+/- 2, forward p/e 23+/- 1, SBUX was making its 20% yoy gains. Last spring I sold my house due to divorce and put another $170,000 on it at $55.60. Now worth $199,292, that's up 17.2%. Starbucks is a feelgood cheap luxury. I shake my head at the haters who feel it necessary to lie about the price of a cup of coffee and trashtalk the taste and the brand and the people who like the place. It's a great American brand and icon known around the world. Yes, SBUX is counting on China to take the baton and yes, the hand-off is suffering a lull, but hang in there. Watch those numbers.

Now if forward analyst consensus estimates are revised downward near-term, SBUX's PT will likely drop to around 60/sh from 65/sh, resulting in a major sell off. What should one do ?Sell the mature company (SBUX)and replace it with a young company that is about to enter a hyper growth phase....The stock is...T X M DTXMD is a 6.43/sh stock with zero debt (SBUX has a staggering $3.99B in debt according to Yahoo) $148M in cash and analysts currently estimate TXMD will grow its earnings ....over 500% between2019-2020. TXMD currently trades for less than 10x forward estimates and analysts believe its 2 lead drugs will be best in class and have an estimated $2B in peak US revenues.....Blackrock recently raised its position in TXMD 30% to 14.4M shares and Cantor currently has a $28/sh PT for TXMD.......In conclusion, based on current analyst consensus estimates on NASDAQ, balance sheet and forward revenue and earnings growth, TXMD has SIGNIFICANTLY....more upside potential than SBUX......
