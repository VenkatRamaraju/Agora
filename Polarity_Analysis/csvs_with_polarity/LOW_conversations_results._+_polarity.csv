All 3 of these companies will trade at much higher prices several years from now and that's really not up for debate.

275,"I still typically shop at LOW instead of HD, simply because I'm a shareholder, but I must say I'm not sure how much longer I'll be that shareholder. The company is managing for the short term in my opinion. They are focused on cost cutting, but instead of looking at how to be more efficient, they're taking the easy route and simply reducing employee costs. That tells me senior management is either out of ideas or simply doesn't want to work hard. It's obvious in the few LOW stores I frequent, there are less employees overall and even more concerning is that the remaining employees are less informed and less interested in customer service. This approach could result in near term earnings beats, better margins, etc., etc., but will likely result in exactly the opposite long term. Maybe management has fallen in to the Amazon trap and believe like many investors that AMZN cannot be beat. If that's the case, bring in new management. There is a lot LOW can do! - Figure out how to better cater to contractors and pull some of that business from HD.- Quickly grow the smaller Orchard Supply Hardware store base, but please don't ruin it.- Heck... Do something transformative and go buy TSCO (Tractor Supply Company). There would be lots of synergies, could likely get at a discount from historic levels and provide growth that LOW sorely needs. I know this is going out on a limb, but it's better than their current strategy.I've been in this for over 8 years and have done well. I'm going to hope for a nice little pop back to the low-mid $80's at which point I'll likely sell all my shares and move on. BTW... I don't believe HD is taking this same approach.",0.9968

568,"Lowes is in much bigger trouble than most people realize, but even some customers are starting to ask if the company is going out of business. Start with the balance sheet. The debt has increased substantially over the last 5 years with the results being failed acquisitions and stock buy-backs, which look like a Ponzi scheme. That was Niblock's doing (the previous CEO). Now, here comes Ellison, a guy who fails everywhere he goes. Got caught up in intrigue at Home Depot before shown the door. Then made a mess at JC Penney's before leaving them without even informing their board. He offers no hope and the employees think he's a joke. But how stupid is the Board at Lowes for hiring this guy in the first place and how many people turned down this job. I find it hard to believe that Ellison was the first choice. Marvin is a silver tongued devil. His notes to employees always embrace the collective approach to success and end with a ""God Bless"" to the employees while his actions like cutting hours and staff only undermine the employees he claims to care about, not to mention the customers who cannot get help because it doesn't exist. Just this past Saturday (day after Black Friday) Lowes reverted to it's new staffing model, i.e. severely reduced staff. Black Friday was of course busy, but at least staffing was good. On Saturday it was even busier and with the purposely reduced man power, it was a nightmare. Anyway, Lowes management is horrible, is often adversarial with employees and worst of all, has no real idea what they are doing. Or maybe they do, if one plans on the next 'Big Short'.",0.8323

Put simply, Defendants surreptitiously attempt to collect the faceprint of every person who appears in front of one of their facial-recognition cameras.” (To find out more about Home Depot tracking customers, click here.)https://massprivatei.blogspot.com/2019/09/home-depot-and-lowes-accused-of.html",0.1005

You want to be more efficient? How about quit bringing in trucks loaded with 50% top stock and get a logistic program in place that delivers needed items on time? We are loading up right now outside lawn and garden and there is two months of winter left. We get four trucks a week. All I do is write item numbers on boxes and top stock them. We touch everything at least twice. Our previous DM would tell us to bring down top stock to a lower top stock shelf, touching it again. Next day more lawn mowers came in and went to the top shelf. Why touch it three times? We have to go up to get it anyway what difference does it make what shelf it is on? They sent us 110 cases of one SKU of calk four months ago. 25 cases have sold the rest sits on a pallet in top stock. LOW should contact IBM and inquire about getting Watson involved in our ordering for more in time items. Special order 25 water heaters for an apartment and our system starts ordering them automatically as it thinks we need them do to a one time order Most inefficient company I ever worked for in my life. LOW keeps 3M in business buying all their tape. Our appliance loft is constantly stuffed. We are tripping over all this inventory and moving it just to get to things we need. That is inefficient. All they care about is stripping away anything they can from their employees. Vacation not used...lose it. Had full time and health care? Try part time and no benefits. They are going to be in trouble real soon as there is not much left to take from the people who actually produce. Now they are just firing and replacing them with millennials who don't know anything except for how to text all day while on the sales floor. Robert Niblock should be the next person to go.

Deciding what to do with cash is always contentious, but that is how activists make their money. Some companies are great at making money, but not as great at using the profits. I am all for reinvesting in the growth of the company and paying shareholders. The buybacks at this level seem to me to be wasteful of company assets. They could have bought back 30% of the company four years ago for 5B. I would like to see a higher div and a split.

Then the housing recession/dip whatever you want to call it is going to cause people to scrap improving their houses. No need to put lipstick on the real estate deals via paint, appliances, backsplashes, vanities etc. In addition, Sears is going to exit bankruptcy with fewer stores but that is going to provide additional supply and they are going to partner with Amazon in appliances.

1133,"As Iv posted before I'm an employee at one of the top performing stores in the northeast in terms of sales, credit, installs, business accounts. There is no way this stock is worth $100 + and instead should be values between 75-85. The only reason this stock is pumped so much is because lowes sells stocks to their employees at a 15% discount to prop up the price, CEO change which has no real track record of success in any company, Bill Ackman money(need I say more) and of course the general state of the markets being close to the ATH. The fundamentals of this company do not warrant the current price.* The company refuses to put people on the floor. We had one of the best years in retail in the past decade and you know what lowes did recently? Cut the hours of full time/part time/ and seasonal employees. They have 1 person in lumber covering hardware and millwork. You need 2 people bare minimum to operate the lumber department which is why contractors are waiting 30min to an hour for a bunk of lumber to be dropped and loaded up. This is also why the stores are dirty and inventory is mismanaged. Nobody but 1 overworked employee covering mutltiple departments!* The only thing Proservice cares about is getting credit and getting business accounts. After that they couldn't be bothered to help you with anything else.* We got rid of our inhouse delivery people which did a hell of a lot of extra things for the customers(brought old refrigerators to peoples garage, hooked people up with free hoses and wires if they needed them and showed older people how to operate the newer machines). Now we have sub contractors of contractors who are basicially ex cons from NY and who couldn't care less about the quality of service that they provide. Literally everyday we get complaints from custumers about how rude they are and that they're not doing business with Lowes anymore.* Buildings are falling apart and roofs leak. Saw in lumber has been out for 2 months. Fork lifts are about to fall apart. * New hirees are part time millennials with no home improvement knowledge that are just thrown into a department with poor improper training*Merchandise that comes off the trailer from the warehouse is just tossed in and usually broken like light bulbs and appliancesIn short good knowledgeable people are leaving and what you have left are resentful and over worked employees.

Hood notes that Hurricanes Harvey and Irma mark the first time two category-4 hurricanes made U.S. landfall in the same year. While storm-related products skew toward lower margin items, the increase in sales volume is significant.In a note to clients, Hood stated: “The combined benefit of both hurricanes to Home Depot’s 2017 sales could approach $1,041 million to $1,318 million, exceeding the combined $672 million benefit for Hurricanes Irene and Sandy. Similarly, the benefit to Lowe’s could be $484 million to $644 million in 2017 compared with a combined benefit of $224 million for Hurricanes Irene and Sandy",0.983

Once that production resumes with economic reopening the price of lumber will fall. If the US and Canada get around to resolving their wood differences the price of lumber falls further.

That in market terms is a ""SUCCESS"" story. Over 100% return in 5 years is fantastic. Nothing to be critical of. HD has a different story and is fine in its own right. My observation is that Lowes hasn't disappointed investors in its stock. And the corporate earnings are facts. And facts don't lie. Long term continual growth. Not at risk of failure.

1931,"When comparing which stock I'd rather own, LOW or HD...the answer is obvious when looking at several things. HD is better for income, but on a yearly chart LOW has dramatically outperformed HD, and has an earnings growth rate over the next 5 years of 24% vs. HD's 9.71 percent. For capital returns LOW is the obvious winner. Plus the fact they had a 152.5% return on equity in 2020 is huge...however I suspect that number will fall back to around 50 percent upon reopening, which is still not too shabby at all. Both have better inventory turnovers than the industry median. LOW has dramatically outperformed the S&P, while HD is line with it. So while I own both, if it came to a new investment and could only choose 1 of those companies it would easily be LOW no contest.",0.9101
1932,"As the economy reopens and the housing construction boom takes off due to the fact the lumber shortage will resolve itself and prices will come down, I expect an acceleration in LOW's revenue and an increase in inventory turnover.

Especially single family housing units will be constructed like crazy once the economy fully opens back up...tools, lumber, pesticides, lawn care, gardening, etc. will all be in high demand. LOW, HD, and SHW will all see massive P/E multiple expansion in the coming years, although there will certainly be a slowdown in demand once supply of houses meets demand. But for the next several years all 3 of these names should be solid investments. I invested in SHW in the $200s pre stock split, LOW last March in the upper 60s, and HD last March as well.

Back in the day when you kept a roll of insulation around, and caulk was inexpensive it wasn't a big deal for contractors to supply these materials. Now supplying them gets a little difficult since we are still working of pre 2000 labor prices and materials we supply have risen 300 to 600 %. My argument is why would a retail store not want to sell the materials to the customer for there job? They are a retail store . If I supply the materials well I'm looking to save as much as posible this means cheap caulk and fiberglass insulation. And I might buy it somewhere else cheaper than Lowes.

What many of you may not know is that quite a few stores survive based on part-timers working full time hours. If you thought service was lacking before, guess what, it's probably not getting better when you add that full-timers are now being asked to sacrifice the one weekend off per month they do get, for one weekend off every 8 weeks. That's six weekends A YEAR a single mother will be able to spend with her kids. How's that for work-life balance? The new system is a software program designed to make schedules based on an algorithm and not the facts on the ground. I digress. Long story short, morale is in the toilet.

2260,"Lowes stores are understaffed all over the country. I have spent hours in lines at the Customer Service desks, trying to return products. They try to staff their appliance depts. like the rest of the store, forgetting that an appliance customer requires a great deal of time to work with a salesperson to select model and type of appliance. Consequently, there are droves of customers who are required to wait for assistance. Most walk out. Lowes special order system is antiquated and doesn't make sense. If you order multiple items from one vendor, but are forced to reselect an item after a few weeks because it isn't available, they cancel and rewrite the PO. What does that do? It starts the clock all over again on the items the vendor did have in stock so you are faced to wait that much longer on the entire order! These types of operational hurdles are what's causing Lowes salespeople and mid-managers to be over worked and stressed out.",0.4913

JD and PDD had complained in the past about BABA who was manipulating the market. One other reason that did contribute t o today's sale off was lack of forecast report by JD.
