Firstly as Morgan Stanley points it out there won't be buyouts, secondly and the most investors concerning about is a new MS drug that will eating away Biogen MS franchise and thirdly the Biotech sector cannot break out of the doldrums. But for Biogen the next earning report will give a clearer picture how much new drug takes its market share and how much royalty they get and their Spinraza drug sale progress. Biogen gave a great guidance for 2017 earnings which is more than $20 per share and they bested in the first quarter. A lot of Analysts still very bullish about Biogen but few are very skeptical. Next Earnings will clear this up. I think there are a lot of things going for Biogen in the long term (1 to 2 yrs) investors will be very well rewarded.",0.9944

AC Immune to Present at 2018 Society for Neurosciences Meeting... $BIIBUpdate on Therapeutic and Diagnostic Programs Targeting TDP-43*** The first update will cover the wholly-owned TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) antibody program aimed to provide novel therapeutic options for patients suffering from TDP-43 proteinopathies such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP). The second update will be on the accompanying diagnostic program focused to deliver positron emission tomography (PET) tracers specific for misfolded and aggregated TDP-43, which is non-exclusively partnered with Biogen Inc.The oral presentation entitled ""Discovery and development of diagnostics and therapeutics for TDP-43 proteinopathies"" includes data on both programs and will be presented on November 4th during the session ""Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies"" (1pm to 3.15 pm, PST; Session #188, in room SDCC 5).AC Immune is developing therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against pathological forms of the transactive response (TAR) DNA binding protein (TDP-43). Misfolded TDP-43 has been identified as the major component of pathological protein inclusions, in both ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP). It has been shown that pathological TDP-43 can spread from neuron to neuron as being described for many pathological proteins in neurodegenerative disease. This mechanism creates the opportunity to interfere with the process through application of monoclonal antibodies. AC Immune is using its proprietary SupraAntigenTM technology to raise a broad panel of monoclonal antibodies targeting misfolded TDP-43 which are currently undergoing functional evaluation. This program is wholly-owned by AC Immune.Complementary to a therapeutic approach, AC Immune is developing novel PET tracers specifically targeting pathological TDP-43 inclusions. Small molecules suitable for PET tracer development are being derived from AC Immune's proprietary MorphomerTM chemistry technology platform, which is designed to interact with misfolded and aggregated proteins. Promising small molecule hits have been identified by binding assays using patient -derived TDP-43 aggregates. The ability to precisely diagnose FTLD and other TDP-43 proteinopathies and therefore treat patients earlier and more accurately is critical to disease management that uses novel therapeutic approaches. This collaboration with Biogen Inc. was established in April 2016; it is non-exclusive, and AC Immune retains intellectual property and commercialization rights.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ac-immune-present-2018-society-100115734.html?guccounter=1",0.9976

526,"BAN2401 trial and accumulated Aducanumab data advanced the thesis that amyloid hypothesis is valid. This hypothesis is succinctly defined as shown below by a Nature report. This hypothesis contends that increases in the amyloid-β 42 (Aβ42) protein trigger a cascade of events in the brain that lead to Alzheimer's disease. Under this hypothesis, individual Aβ42 monomers aggregate into damaging oligomers and fibrils in or near Aβ42 plaques. Aβ aggregates cause certain inflammatory responses. Through unknown mechanisms, these events lead to the aggregation, phosphorylation and propagation of tau, a protein that is associated with microtubules (pink and purple) and is the main constituent of harmful tangles. Affected neurons and synapses become dysfunctional and can die, leading to additional inflammatory responses. The progressive dysfunction, degeneration and loss of affected neurons and synapses is associated with cognitive decline, other symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and increasing disability. Sevigny et al.2 report that the Aβ-binding antibody aducanumab binds to, promotes removal and blocks accumulation of fibrils and oligomers. [NATURE, v. 537, p36, 2016]",0.2581

Only issue is that such an analysis is not a GOLD standard in GLP. But considering unmet demand, I think, Adu will be probably approved by the FDA despite a split decision by ADCOM. The agency granted Priority Review w/o Vouch only a month after Biogen submitted the application. It is unprecedented. Furthermore, the regulatory agency also said they are planning to expedite the review process further if possible. This clearly shows the FDA is willing to approve Adu with imperfect clinical data.

All patients had severe comorbidities that rendered them ineligible for the ongoing randomized, controlled phase 2b/3 trial being conducted to ascertain safety and efficacy of RLF-100, and all patients were deteriorating despite treatment with approved therapies for COVID-19. Overall, 81% of RLF-100-treated patients survived beyond 60 days, compared to 17% of control patients. Patients treated with RLF-100 demonstrated a 9-fold increased probability of survival and recovery from respiratory failure, with a high degree of statistical significance.

But the last bit of data that straggled in by 3/19 showed that Emerge met the study endpoint but not Engage, which was trending very poorly. In fact the primary and one of the secondary endpoints in Engage showed more mental decline as compared to the placebo for the high dose. To make matters worse, the Engage low dose patients did better than the high dose patients and better than the placebo. The purpose of two identical studies is for reproducibility, meaning the results from both trials should be close. Engage and Emerge do not show reproducible data and without this both trials should be ignored. But aha! The white coats at BIIB observed that if only the augmented high dose patients were counted in Engage, it would pass. Then with two aligned studies, the FDA would approve.

1281,"Sean Williams wrotte on 5th August, 2015:""Shares of biotech blue-chip stock Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) were walloped in July, with its stock losing 21% of its market value based on data from S&P Capital IQ. The primary culprits were weaker-than-expected second-quarter earnings results and early stage data involving Alzheimer's drug aducanumab that didn't exactly thrill investors...Adding insult to injury, just a few days prior to its Q2 release, Biogen released additional data from its phase 1b study involving aducanumab, and the data, while still showing statistical significance, wasn't as amazing as its top-line release a few months prior. The mental acuity score for the placebo group of patients demonstrated a smaller decline than before, while the 1 mg and 6 mg doses didn't appear to offer as strong a benefit as the 3 mg and 10 mg doses. The good news is the updated data for the 3 mg and 10 mg doses still appears to be statistically strong. ...So what should you do? My suggestion would be to hang tight. I see little reason to rush into owning Biogen, particularly with Alzheimer's disease drugs having such a high failure rate. Although Biogen has two potential mega-blockbusters in its pipeline (aducanumab and anti-lingo-1), they both are in indications where the failure rate is high.

1392,"Biogen (BIIB) Or ABBVBiogen received a major setback when it lost a patent dispute with Mylan (MYL) for blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera. This means that Tecfidera might now face competition from generics. Tecfidera accounted for 40% of Biogen’s product revenues in 2019 and 42% in the second quarter of 2020.On August 19, Mylan announced the launch of its first generic to Biogen’s Tecfidera. However, it is a launch-at-risk since the litigation between Mylan and Biogen is ongoing.Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Raymond said that he is ""incrementally cautious"" on Biogen following the launch of Mylan’s generic version to Tecfidera. Raymond has a Hold rating for Biogen with a $270 price target.There has also been controversy with regard to Biogen’s potential Alzheimer's drug aducanumab. The company had discontinued the development of this drug in March 2019 as it failed to prove effective in treating Alzheimer’s in phase 3 clinical trial. However, Biogen changed its stance on aducanumab in October 2019 and said that the earlier analysis was incorrect as it was based on a smaller dataset.On August 7, the company announced that the FDA has accepted Biogen and Eisai’s license application for aducanumab with priority review.Meanwhile, Biogen delivered better-than-anticipated results for the second quarter. Biogen’s second-quarter revenue rose 2% Y/Y $3.68 billion. The quarter’s adjusted EPS rose 12% to $10.26.Tecfidera revenue increased 3% Y/Y to $1.18 billion. Sales from spinal muscular atrophy Spinraza rose only 1% to $495 million perhaps due to increased competition as Novartis’s Zolgensma was approved last year. Overall, Biogen’s total product revenues declined 3% to $2.80 billion, including a 7% fall in biosimilar revenues.But, Biogen’s second-quarter top-line benefited from $208 million in Ocrevus royalties from Roche, which increased 14% Y/Y. Also, other revenues rose 155% to $408 million mainly driven by revenue from the licensing of certain manufacturing-related intellectual property to one of the company’s corporate partners. Biogen stock has declined 6.0% year-to-date. An average price target of $316.05 indicates an upside potential of 13.3% in Biogen stock. The Street has a Hold consensus that breaks down into 10 buys, 16 Holds, and 3 Sells.So, AbbVie or Biogen?AbbVie’s higher debt levels and lower operating margin compared to Biogen go against it. But, it is notable that AbbVie rewards shareholders through dividends while Biogen makes no dividend payments. AbbVie has an impressive dividend yield of 5.0%.Overall, dividends, strong sales growth prospects supported by Allergan acquisition, analysts’ bullish stance and higher upside potential makes us choose AbbVie over Biogen.",0.9957

I think acquiring BIIB would make a lot of sense for a company like J&J, Merck, or Pfizer. The Board of Directors at BIIB would sign-off on any deal at or above $310/share (biotech firms sell at a typical premium of 40-to-50%) given that the public markets seem unwilling to price the company at fair value in the foreseeable future. A $310/share price would still have BIIB at just 10 times forward earnings (and around 13.4 times trailing 12 months earnings. This is a great deal for shareholders at Merck, JNJ or Pfizer that are all valued at close to 15 times forward earnings.

Relatively healthy vs. Already diseased and rescued.Starting with almost healty subjects (MMSE scores 24 to 30) might distort the trial as the fast deteriorating patients are excluded and the duration is only 18 months. See illusration above.The incidence of ARIA still present vs. almost none on Blarcamesine side.Just another attempt to rescue the amyloid hypothesis for Alzhiemer’s on closer examination doesn’t hold water.The simplest expalaination of Aducanumab strategy is to remove the worst offenders and still compare to placebo arm containing those worst offenders but your claim rests on the fact that relatively healthy rest of the dosed arm do not start to deteriorate untill much later.""",0.9428

If you examine Biogen earnings and Extremely low PE, you can recognize that stock is very undervalued. This stock should be trading in the 325-335 range, just alone on the earnings and that would bring it PE more in line to other competitive companies...Biogen has many drugs they are working on besides Aducamaub. People are so forcused in Aducamaub that Biogen is trading at a discount. If Aducamaub does get approved then the stock will go to low 400’s. In my opinion, I think it will get approval from FDA with some conditions. Since there are no drugs out in the world to treat Alzheimer’s, this drug Aducamaub is a start to help slow the process down...Biogen should go up gradually, far to cheap for a 15Billion dollar company with a PE of 8...",0.9855

It plans to initiate a first in human study, scheduled for the second half of 2018. The new compound is highly selective for alpha-synuclein aggregates, an established target for Parkinson's disease and other diseases with alpha-synuclein pathologies (referred to as synucleinopathies in general). New data will be presented at the AAT-AD/PDTM* Focus Meeting 2018 in Torino, Italy, today, March 15, 2018.Prof. Andrea Pfeifer, CEO of AC Immune, said: ""We are excited about this significant step in our development of potentially the first ever PET tracer for earlier and more accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. This important milestone underlines our vision to become a global leader in precision medicine of neurodegenerative diseases, leveraging our proprietary technology platforms.""This next generation tracer was discovered using the company's proprietary MorphomerTM chemistry technology platform. AC Immune has been successfully collaborating on this program with Biogen since April 2016. The companies will continue to further research, develop and clinically validate this alpha-synuclein PET tracer that will be used as an imaging biomarker for Parkinson's disease with an aim to enable the clinical development of new disease-modifying therapies. This project from AC Immune is being supported by The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research (MJFF).Jamie Eberling, PhD, Director of Research Programs at MJFF, commented: ""We are very pleased about this next important step in the development of an alpha-synuclein imaging agent. Having a PET tracer to detect and track Parkinson's disease would be transformative for Parkinson's research and patient care.""In summary :The companies will continue to further research, develop and clinically validate this alpha-synuclein PET tracer that will be used as an imaging biomarker for Parkinson's disease with an aim to enable the clinical development of new disease-modifying therapies. http://cws.huginonline.com/A/171580/PR/201803/2176472_5.htmlhttps://www.acimmune.com/en/pipeline-overview/",0.9986

While the pickup of the small gene therapy biotech bolsters Biogen's pipeline, there are plenty of reasons why its shopping spree could continue.Sales are slipping for Biogen's multiple sclerosis (MS) franchise. The biotech's five MS drugs generate around 57% of total revenue. Royalties from Roche's (NASDAQOTH: RHHBY) sales of MS drug Ocrevus help somewhat, but Ocrevus also hurts some of Biogen's other MS drugs. Biogen's total revenue continues to increase, with year-over-year revenue up 11% in the first quarter. That growth is being driven primarily by spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) drug Spinraza. The bad news for Biogen is that Spinraza now has competition with the recent FDA approval of Novartis' (NYSE: NVS) SMA gene therapy Zolgensma.Shareholders had hoped that Biogen's Alzheimer's disease drug aducanumab would live up to its hype as a potential game changer. However, the drug flopped in late-stage clinical studies.Biogen still has money to spend on acquisitions, though.

2401,"An excellent read posted on the AVXL board by Morten...46 weeks - MMSE declines by ~ 1.6 points (Putting it in perspective)From a study showing how MMSE scores decline once a person contracts Alzheimer's disease:In contrast, the MMS declined an average of 2.15 points per year (95% CI 1.85-2.46) during the first two years, accelerated to 3.83 points per year (95% CI 3.28-4.38) during the subsequent three years and then slowed to an annual decline of 1.63 points during the last two years (95% CI 0.21-3.05). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3014643/The MMSE test has a maximum of 30 (30 being perfect). Typically, a score of 24 or greater indicates normal cognition. A score of 19 to 23 indicates mild impairment. A score of 10-18 is moderate impairment. And any score below 10 is severe impairment.The average length of time someone lives who gets Alzheimer's disease is ~4.5 years if diagnosed after age 70. The average MMSE for people diagnosed with Alzheimers is around 24 to 26. These patients if not treated can expect their MMSE score to decline by 4.3 in the first 2 years. They would be more forgetful and start to forget some names and have trouble doing various things. In the next 2 years (4 years total), their MMSE would decline another 7.66 points. They would be down a total of 11.96 points. By this time, the average person won't be able to drive and will need someone to watch them. They are moderately impaired and can still do things on their own - just not complex tasks. They will begin forgetting who their friends were and won't recall common facts. Can't be trusted with their finances. In the next couple of years (total of 6 after diagnosis) if they live that long, the average person will become severely impaired and MMSE will have decline by 15.63. Can't cook, will start forgetting everything in their life. Quality of life near zero.Consider that in three years, Anavex 2-73 data for high concentrations show a decline of about ~ 1.6 and an even smaller decline in ADCS (Activities of Daily Living Inventory). A smaller drop in ADCS is consistent with the brain and person learning to compensate for loss of cognitive ability. I.e., learning to spend more time and think harder about activities, write down important things and etc., If the trend continues, by 6 years, their would be a drop of 3.3 and by 9 years, there would be a drop of 4.8.What does this mean? It means that the average person who gets Alzheimer's after age 70 who takes a high dose of AVXL 2-73 would be able to live out their life until death still remembering their life while being able to live on their own if they are otherwise healthy enough to do so.It is not a complete cure - but enough of one that people can keep their dignity until death.For those who have earlier onset Alzheimers disease (before age 70), on average they live 10 to 12 years.For those people, if not treated would end up needing comprehensive care after 5 or 6 years until death. They will live to forget their entire life.If AVXL 2-73 works as well on these type patients, they would have many additional years of good life and would probably still die remembering the majority of their life, friends and relatives.",0.9825

Yes the Alzheimer’s drug is fantastic and I believe the application will beaccepted by the FDA. Biogen came out stared the drug works significantly on reducing the Alzheimer’s process, will little to none risks... Honestly, I think the hedge funds are pushing this down. This will skyrocket in the next to months because the FDA has to make their decision to accept or reject the application. If accepted and eventually within 6 months FDA does accept the drug, this stock will be well over $1000...I’m puzzled why it’s at this price. I have been accumulating at all different prices...

This is the number from the Morningstar analyst, and I get about the same. When I apply a typical profit margin to get to the impact on income/cash flow and then discount that to today, I get a positive impact on market cap of $4B at best. That is interestingly the amount by which Eisai's market cap increased on the news, and the two companies have an agreement to split the profits equally. So the reaction to the news, at best (given approval uncertainty), for BIIB's market cap should be about a $4B increase, not an $11-12B increase.

We are getting close to the time where we only have to wait 1 year, and time flies. I suspect that the longer we wait without negative news, the higher the probability of success.

2702,Interestingly enough. No news nor downgrade and volume is 20% higher than average. The treasury at Biogen maybe shorting a bit so they can buyback some of the shares at a lower price.

The after hours shows a bit of a spike on the calls. I can see Biogen going toward $300 by year end. The only downside I see is the write off on the failed Alzheimer’s drug. Biogen should have many more drugs in the pipeline. The write off may hurt earnings but in a few months it will all be forgotten. For Biogen to authorize a $5B buyback. They have sufficient funds to do more research and develop more drugs to extend life. I am confident that they will increase EPS via buyback (ingenious move) and continue to develop more money making drugs. No drug companies have a 100% success ratio.
