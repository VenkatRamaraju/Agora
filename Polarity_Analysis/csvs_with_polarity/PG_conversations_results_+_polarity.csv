A mild-mannered executive not prone to hyperbole, Mr. Glass explained the razor giant’s predicament in a 1987 interview. “We’re operating, frankly, under wartime conditions,” he told the Globe. “We have a sense of mission that won’t ease up for several years.”With his business skills and reputation for integrity, Mr. Glass helped the Boston-based company persuade shareholders to reject the lure of fast cash from corporate raiders.

147,"Procter & Gamble (ticker: PG) is up 10.8% in 2020, while the Dow has gained 6.3%.Although P&G began the year with an earnings miss, it has delivered three strong reports since. The shares didn’t react much in April, as demand for cleaning products was hampered by concerns about a strong dollar and the uncertain outlook at the start of the pandemic.Yet the company has been raising its dividend while continuing share repurchases, and its July results showed that even economic uncertainty couldn’t dampen sales of its portfolio of premium cleaning products. The company turned in another strong quarter in October, as organic sales continued to shine.Naturally, 2021 will present a challenge for P&G, as the receding threat of the virus will take some focus off cleaning. Yet others argue that the standard for cleaning will permanently be higher post-pandemic, to the benefit of P&G and peers. In addition, P&G has historically had one of the higher organic growth rates in the staples industry. Those metrics will certainly fall a bit in 2021, but if it can continue to show that it’s resonating with consumers, the shares need not fade with Covid.Analysts seem fairly bullish about P&G.

429,"From Morningstar:Investment ThesisErin Lash, CFA, Sector Director, 25 April 2018Following Procter & Gamble's multiyear effort to cullaround 100 brands from its mix (leaving it with 65 brands),we think the firm is now poised to benefit from anenhanced focus on its highest-return opportunities. Whilegrooming and baby care (around one third of sales in theaggregate) continue to languish, we think theimprovement chalked up in its beauty (nearly one fifth ofsales) and fabric care (one third of sales) segments (uplow to midsingle digits) showcases the first fruits of P&G’sefforts to rationalize its mix. And while improvement hasyet to prove broad-based, we expect the firm’s continuedinvestments behind core brands will lead to increasingconsolidated sales growth and support its brandintangible asset.In our view, despite slimming down, we still think P&Gwill carry clout with retailers, maintaining its scale edge.The 65 brands it maintains in its portfolio include 21 thatgenerate $1 billion-$10 billion in annual sales and another11 that account for $500 million-$1 billion in sales eachyear. We believe that by supplying products acrossmultiple categories (such as fabric care, baby care,feminine care, and grooming among others), trustedmanufacturers like P&G are critical to retailers looking todrive traffic, both into physical stores and on e-commerceplatforms.Further, we don’t believe P&G is anchored to acceleratingtop-line improvement at any cost, and surmise that effortsto drive efficiencies (targeting $10 billion, a high-teenspercentage of costs) are prudent--aimed at reducingoverhead, lowering material costs, and increasingmanufacturing and marketing productivity. And whileinflationary and promotional pressures are unlikely tosubside near term (in line with commentary expressed byother consumer product manufacturers), we think itsstringent focus on costs stand to modestly boost grossmargins (up 100 basis points to 51% by fiscal 2027) longerterm, while also fueling research and development(including improved packaging) and marketing.

530,"The *ONLY* problem with PG is its share price. Like Apple, many day traders have started trading it. This is why when Big Tech is up, MSFT and AAPL are generally up higher than AMZN and TSLA. Traders would rather use $30K on a $130 stock than using it on a $3K stock. Unfortunately, this creates short term volitility. This is the onyl downside to PG.Other than that, if you are a long term holder, PG is the safest investment on the market. Always has been and always will be. Guaranteed 5-10%/year. That may not look great, especially over the past year...but all bubbles burst. It's only a matter of time. And when it does, all these traders will lose most of what they will have made. PG, though, will still stand tall.Oh, one last thing. The Citi price cut dragged down the price from $139 to $131. Guess what? Their PT is still $150, and that's on the low side of the spectrum. I'm not worried about PG at all. 100% of my money is in PG (around $40K), and it's for the long haul. I put aside $500-1,000/month and put it into PG every month. Why? People would say this is risky. It isn't. PG is the only company that cannot be overtaken, at least within the next 30-50 years. Their distribution network is too strong. Their partnerships are too strong.

""As of year-ended June 30, 2018....from the annual report (form 10-K filing)""as well as the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset cushion, have both been reduced to below 10%, both due in large part to an increased competitive market environment, a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits and significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar that have occurred in recent years""The foreign exchange nonsense that the CEO spouted is dubious at best for the $8B writedown. The auditors would never have cleared an existing impairment of $8B that existed in 2005 from ""foreign exchange"" for the 2018 statements. The bulk should have already been accounted for as implied in the 2018 note since the auditors were are of this significant adjustment....and you won't accumulate $8B of f-ex on goodwill in a year.It's clear that something else is recently plaguing Gillette.....now what could that possibly be?!!?!?",0.984

700,"Today's Morningstar analyst note:Analyst NoteErin Lash, CFA, Sector Director, 19 April 2018Lagging sales continue to dog wide-moat Procter &Gamble, with organic sales up just 1%, reflecting a 3%benefit from increased volumes and favorable mix, offsetby a 2% reduction in price. This weakness (not dissimilarfrom the past few quarters) was concentrated within thegrooming (10% of sales) and baby (27%) segments, whichwere each down 3% on an organic sales basis. Whilethese results are far from a plus, we’re encouraged by theimprovement chalked up in its beauty (nearly one fifth ofsales, up 5%) and fabric care (one third of sales, up 3%)segments. We think these gains showcase the first fruitsof P&G’s efforts to rationalize its mix. And whileimprovement has yet to prove broad-based, we expect thefirm’s continued investments behind core brands will leadto increasing consolidated sales growth and support itsbrand intangible asset.Beyond its quarterly results, P&G also announced itintends to terminate its healthcare joint venture withno-moat Teva and has inked a deal to acquireGerman-based narrow-moat Merck’s consumer healthcarebrands for $4 billion (3.7 times trailing-12-month sales and20 times EBITDA). In our view, this tie up (which is expectedto close by the end of the calendar year) stands to replacethe scale and technological know-how lost following thedissolution of its joint venture partnership. As such, wedon’t portend it signals a reversal in the firm’s strategy tooperate with a leaner brand mix. At just 1%-2% of sales,we surmise this addition evidences management’sopenness to selectively bolstering its reach in attractivecategories (consumer health growing midsingle digits) andgeographies. After assessing the quarterly results and theconsumer healthcare deal, we don’t foresee a materialchange to our $98 fair value estimate. With shares downaround 3% following this news, we’d suggest investorsstock on shares, which trade at a more than 20% discountto our valuation and boast a more than 4% annual dividend yield",0.9961

I wonder if Jim should go back and look at his tapes and then put the PG on his forehead for a day for telling people last year to sell PG .

It is resilient to economic cycles and investors tend to ""fly to safety"" in more defensive equities like PG and bonds. thats why the stock is up so much over the past few months. due to the growth rate of the company a PE of 25+ is not warranted in any other situation but one where volatility is as high as it has been. If you look at the stock historically it forms a very consistent pattern. when the market volatility is high the stock skyrockets, then once the volatility dies down the stock tanks ( it goes too far both ways every time) look at the history, this correction, the correction earlier this year around January, and the correction in 2016.

Here is a link to the story which includes the video of a Navy pilot chasing a UFO.https://www.nytimes.com/…/…/secret-pentagon-ufo-program.htmlPerhaps the strongest evidence came at a 2001 conference at the National Press club, where ex-military, NASA, FAA, and intelligence officials came forward to give their experiences.On Wednesday, May 9th, 2001, over twenty military, intelligence, government, corporate and scientific witnesses came forward at the National Press Club in Washington, DC to establish the reality of UFOs or extraterrestrial vehicles, extraterrestrial life forms, and resulting advanced energy and propulsion technologies. The weight of this first-hand testimony, along with supporting government documentation and other evidence, established without any doubt the reality of these phenomena. These individuals offered to give sworn testimony to Congress about their encounters, but Congress has refused to hear them. Instead for 60 years, the government has covered up and lied to the American people about the existence of UFOs.Here is a link to the press conference, please watch and pass on!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-iaV_XW9iE",0.9956
