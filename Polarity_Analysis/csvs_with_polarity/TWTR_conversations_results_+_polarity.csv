In most publicly traded corporations this would be tolerated for no more than a nanosecond.His actions intentionally injured the return on investment of shareholders and taking such actions violated the basic fiduciary rights investors expect to be upheld. Given that the top 10 owners of the 751 million shares of Twitter’s stock are all financial services and mutual fund companies there are a lot of shareholders that have said expectations.And last week Jack Dorsey purposely and with malice of forethought made all of them take a bath. He did so without any justification for his actions as it pertained to the welfare of the corporation. His actions caused the company to lose 16 percent of stock value—close to $7 billion in actual dollars—and in essence killed its ability to deliver its number one product: an audience.So there are plenty of reasons shareholders, the public, and former Twitter users should consider legal recourse.""",-0.4063

Then they try to prove the theories to figure out the root cause. That's the process. 100 years ago Albert Einstein's created many theories that were not proven at all until now. So if you use conspiracy theory then Albert Einstein's theories were conspiracy theories for 100 years as well - right? In his theory, legendary scientist Stephen Hawking said black holes could emit radiation, it's called Hawking Radiation. Not proven, no one knows whether in future it could be proved to be true.

704,"Twitter – Trying to re-find relevance before it is too lateIt is important to note the major demographic headwinds Twitter is facing. Youth and Millennials are not flocking to Twitter (pardon for the pun) except in rare cases to view announcements from their favorite pastimes (sports, music, entertainment, finance, politics). They very much prefer Snapchat, Pinterest and Instagram (plus many one-off versions thereof). Twitter exists for them, but only in passing. They are the future of communication and social media. Jack & Company would prize this demographic if it could break into it better.To the youth of today, Twitter (which has been around FOREVER in their minds) is the Yahoo! of yesteryear. I know of what I speak, my millennial son (& daughter) refuse to check Twitter even for information about his own college sports team (he is on)! They are addicted to the other venues; he and my daughter have no interest in what Lady Gaga had for lunch or how good or bad whatever administration in office is.On the opposite end of the spectrum are the Boomers who comprise ~30% of the US population. They live, breath and die Facebook (connect to family, friends). Remember the commercial where the lady used Post-it notes for her posts on the dry erase board? That captured many a boomer’s attention. Within the past year some created secondary ‘social media’ Twitter accounts to discuss politics. As-of late, few have stayed, but many have fled back to the friendly confines of Facebook.In the middle is where Jack & Co. exist, the Gen-X, Gen-Z and other folk between 32 and 55. They want to know stuff and they want to know now. They do have very solid buying power and are attractive to advertisers. With the new business model they are working on, he and the executive team are trying to upsell this demographic the best they can. Announcing paid content, paid accounts to follow, and anything that could generate revenue off the main focus group.It is unfortunate, and not likely, the other ends of the social media demographic pie will ever migrate; Twitter management knows this only too well. As the millennials age, they will take up more and more room on the social media spectrum and unfortunately, Yahoo! (sorry, I meant Twitter) is not going to be in their wheelhouse.Many of that middle group are now exiting for different discussion venues, and that is important loss Jack & Co. have to overcome. Twitter is a STATUS application. In the ‘biz’ we call it ‘push communications’. You can ‘push’ out content and status, but as for the true ‘social’ backbone, it is very narrow; Twitter was never engineered to be a BLOG. Remember, they even reported user interactions down in Q4 and we have yet to even see a taste of Q1.Telegram is a MAJOR apple cart disrupter for Twitter. They are engineered to be a major ‘push’ engine. Channels are subscribed to and push information to users. There are discussions in Chat Channels, but nothing compared to the subscribed channels with folk waiting for information.Why do I bring up Telegram? In a short amount of time they have almost doubled the number of users Twitter has. They are growing quickly. There is ALWAYS a new kid on the block trying to win the social media beat down game.Parler you say? Niche only. Folk disgruntled ONLY about a political outcome seem to be over there. Between it and GAB and CloutHub, they may have drained off 10% of the Twitter user attention.So where does this leave Jack & Co. They are completely redoing their business model to capture the ‘middle dollars’. Boomers, Millennials and youth won’t pay for them. Advertisements are nice but non-middle demographic folk already have one-click Amazon prime accounts and know what they want. They are getting harder and harder to influence.So where does that leave Twitter compared to the big dog, Facebook?Facebook earns $10.09 per share. It has a P/E of 25.98 given a price of $262. Facebook market cap is 745.83B. Financially speaking, they are under valued for a social media platform.Twitter earns -$1.44 per share and has no P/E. Twitter market cap is 61.91B. Twitter with a current price of $77 would have to earn $4 per share to support the same P/E (check my math). Yes, they just earned 39 cents in Q4 and projecting a loss Q1 of 2021. The hill is super steep.Maybe Jack & Co. can get to $4 share in EPS, maybe not. He has to put all the boots on the ground or Twitter really has no bright future given their narrow demographic constraints and social media ‘push’ platform.Be careful out there chasing stocks or cars!",0.9993

858,I thought freedom of speech is when you can voice a different perspective on truth. The research you do to make a winning stock trade should also be made in how you understand the news ! Follow a variety of news outlets and watch a half hour each day of MSNBC FOX CNN and even 15 minutes of NEWSMAX. By doing this you will have a great balance on what the truth is. If you follow news on the net such as Twitter or Facebook and focus on as many as two similar articles whether positive or negative those platform's algorithms will feed you similar stories backing up the same view. This puts people in a herd of thinkers that could follow lies and false beliefs. These algorithms are not acceptable to freedom of finding the truth ! It could lead many down a dark rabbit hole. Many who lost work because of covid shut downs seemed to want to follow reasons why they lost their jobs. Its because of covid and I feel their pain. Just as the algorithmic codes run the stock market we still do our research to see the truth.please understand sites like Twitter and Facebook haven't focused on what's true because they make greater fees if they take you down whatever rabbit hole you choose. Remember your worth more than your financial success. Things will get better you have to have social emotional physical and spiritual success in your life to be balanced. I know most or at least many feel financial success may be the greatest of them all ! Know that covid has tested each of us and many are fed-up with life !

Here it is (from a bullish perspective: $SNAP delivers comparable ad ROI returns to that of $FB and gets similar ARPU grab to $FB (~$45-$50/DAU annually). Keep in mind, $SNAP will likely drive far more advertiser value than $TWTR long-term while $TWTR is already monetizing at $16-$17/DAU annually.In addition, $SNAP continues to expand its international use as the rebuilt Android design draw in the international crowd. Keep in mind that $SNAP is still early-innings in many of these international markets, so there is a lot of room for expansion. So, let's value $SNAP. What's it really worth. Well, to understand that, let's try to think about where the business will be in a decade. Here are the numbers behind the narrative:- ARPU of $45- DAUs of 500mln- Revenue of $22.5bln- 87% gross margins ($6 of CoRPU, mostly infrastructure/revenue share, and content creation costs)- ~$6 billion in OpEx (vs. ~$2.2B in 2020)On the current share count of ~1.5B shares, 2030 $SNAP is doing ~$9/share in EPS. Assuming a 4% earnings yield (basically 25x earnings) for a high margin, high growth tech business, which is roughly in line with present-day $FB, then $SNAP can be worth ~$225/share in 2030. Discounting back at ~7%/year (low rate environment, moderating equity beta, low ERP) I'm at a 2022 year end PT of ~$125/share.",0.9899

The company will not be required to make any additional payments.In addition, under the terms of the settlement, Twitter’s insurers will pay $38 million to the company that will be used for general corporate purposes. Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion initiated a Hold rating on TWTR last week and set his price target at $45. This implies downside potential of around 6% from current levels.",0.959

2307,"A while back I saw an article trying to estimate the value of Trump to TWTR. This was 4 years ago when the stock was $15. They had Trump at $2 Billion. Add 4 years of growth because of Trump being President, and all the other conservative personalities (who were also deleted, it was NOT only Trump), and all their followers, and replies, retweets, and retweeted retweets, so on and so on. Then look at the profitability of the company, or rather the lack of it. This will very likely swing them to a loss, and if angry conservatives start boycotting advertisers, this could be extremely damaging. This isnt some spineless advertiser caving because of one or 2 angry liberals, this is half the country. While there may be damage tomorrow, the real damage will come over the next few quarters. Neither Trump, nor his 88.7 million followers are ever coming back. Ever. This is a permanent, self inflicted injury by someone with a fiduciary duty to protect shareholders. This will very likely be the largest shareholder lawsuit action history.",-0.312

2319,"Hello all. I figured I would lay out why I'm a long-term bull on $PINS and why it is one of my favorite names within the social media advertising universe. First of all let's understand the value propositions for $PINS from both an advertiser and a user perspective: Starting with the users. Users love $PINS because it's simply a different type of platform. This isn't a platform where the most engagement (likes, comments, etc.) wins (like $TWTR or $FB). It's an inspiration engine of sorts. If you want to get ideas for a vacation, or how to redecorate your house you use $PINS. $PINS is like an inspiration search engine. The more you show $PINS about what you enjoy on the platform, the more they can curate specific content to you. The social aspect is the exchanging of inspiration. This leaves users with a sweet taste in their mouth after using the platform, whereas $FB and $TWTR users tend to be more bitter after using the app (think of the crazy political discourse on those apps). The stats back it up: 47% of $PINS users have an intent to purchase vs. mid to high teens on other platforms. This isn't a social media platform, it's social commerce.For advertisers: Users have high purchase intent, there is a lot of first party data that $PINS has on platform to better target and curate ads, and it doesn't have the PR backlash of advertising on $TWTR or $FB. Sure, you might not get the third party targeting, and the automated ad platform is still in the early innings, but the long-term value proposition for advertisers is there: 459 million people are looking for inspiration. Give it to them.",0.9916

In $SNAP's Analyst Day event they highlight the ways they are going to sustain strong engagement. At this point in time, $SNAP has differentiated itself enough from the competition that the risk of competition grabbing users is likely minimal. It's happened before, but $SNAP's platform has grown and evolved since then, adding new, entrenching features to retain and add users. In addition, because of it's privacy-centric and content-moderation lite structure, $SNAP will not incur costs that a $FB or $TWTR would from content moderation, meaning their operating margins could actually be much higher long-term than anything $FB or $TWTR is doing. At the end of the day, I'm focused on the long-term of this company. The biggest concern about this company is it's valuation. And believe me, I understand the concern.

So Twitter use was up big because of the elections... people were involved and using Twitter for their info and news source, that ran the stock price up, I get it. When twitter reported the increase in users, everyone assumed that increase would be permanent.... Then they banned President Trump.... then they started kicking off (permanent suspensions) a ton of conservatives! Twitter got super boring with those big name conservatives gone... I've noticed it myself... I mean BORING. Conservatives are jumping ship in big numbers to GAB. When Twitter went all out with there bans and censoring, everyone started jumping to Parler, but then amazon who hosted Parlers servers shut them down. Everyone jumped to GAB. Gab is a GREAT platform that does not censor. People are finding all their old twitter favorites on GAB now. Conservatives love GAB & don't really care to go back to Parler & will never go back to Twitter. Twitter shot itself in the foot by banning and censoring 50% of it's users. What were they thinking?? And they are still banning on a daily basis. Everyone knows one day they will wake up and find themselves kicked off of twitter so they are establishing their Gab accounts. Honestly, GAB is a better looking more user friendly site than twitter and they don't limit the characters/ words you can use in a post. I know this post jumps around but I'm on my way out the door so don't have time to proof read. In short, Twitter is going to go down because President Trump and other big names have been kicked off, the elections are over so people are spending their time elsewhere, conservatives are jumping to GAB in great numbers because all their favorites are there, because they know their twitter days are numbered before they get banned... and many are also leaving in protest to Twitter.

The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of Twitter's common stock, or a combination of both, the company said.In connection with the pricing of the notes, Twitter expects to enter into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers or other financial institutions, the company said.Twitter plans to use a part of the net proceeds from this offering to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions, and the remaining proceeds pay any amounts due upon conversion or at maturity of its 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2021 and for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, working capital and potential acquisitions.share dilution ?",0.966

Their decline began in 2020 and in a few short years they’re going to be in a free fall as the public confidence in them rapidly erodes. A major realignment will take place and MICROSOFT is going to emerge as the dominant leader because of a spectacular growth in its revenue and profitability. Coupled with the fact that CEO Nadella is a level headed person focused on Microsoft’s growth and not activism, investors will see the value in its stock. I believe even more investment will flow into the $MSFT stock starting this year.My prediction for other stocks:1 Investors will start realizing that $AMZN’s valuation is significantly higher than its peers. I believe the stock won’t surpass the ATH it saw in 2020. It is quite likely that the stock price may decline during 2021.2 $AAPL stock will likely grow higher during 2021, but its high flying days are over. Apple car is just a concept and it will be several years before a physical product is launched. In the meantime, Tesla Cybertruck and a possible low priced car may already be in the roads, thereby making Tesla the undisputed leader. It will be very difficult to penetrate its market. I see no innovation from Apple and investors will see that too.3 Stocks like $GOOG, $FB, $TWTR will likely stagnate and commence MASSIVE declines. I expect that regulations by governments around the world will act as catalysts to their decline.4 Other tech stocks like $WDAY, $NOW, $CRM will likely have more realistic P/E.",0.9655

4444,"Stock quotes in this article: TWTRAfter Thursday's column, I feel it is the right time to delineate my case against Twitter (TWTR) . So much of what I read in the financial media (not on Twitter, as I deactivated my account last week) on stocks is subjective, numbers-free blather, and in fact quite useless. So I have made it clear that Twitter is awful AND awfully overvalued, but let's focus on the second part.How about a little actual financial analysis to bolster an opinion on a stock? Trust me, it feels good, almost as good as deleting your Twitter account!First, we start with revenues. I am limited in space in this column, so won't have time to delve into Twitter's profitability metrics, but we live in a world where tech companies are valued based multiples of ""revs,"" so I will stick with that. The key to any analysis of financial statements is disaggregation.For Twitter we start -- and finish -- with the one metric given by management: mDAUs, or monetizable daily active users. Twitter changed to this metric in February 2019, and, in and of itself, it is meaningless. But it is a good base for modeling. Twitter's recent quarterly report showed 187 million mDAUs with 36 million users in the U.S., and 152 million abroad. I am assuming the difference is due to rounding.That's where Jack Dorsey's ship will start to sink. Twitter -- and every social media company -- receives a strong valuation based on user base figures that are full of people who don't actually use the service, but do have an account. But with this latest movement -- of which I am glad to be a part -- folks are deactivating their Twitter accounts, not just ignoring them.Those user numbers are going to plummet. I would expect this to happen when first-quarter figures are reported in April, not as much when full-year results are reported Feb. 9. How low can they go? Well Twitter's mDAU base is small to begin with, so that the initial drop-off will be quite noticeable.It is the international figure that is more difficult to divine. Twitter's public affairs division Thursday astoundingly criticized the government of Uganda for restricting social media to prevent interference in an upcoming election (didn't Twitter just do that, repeatedly, here in the U.S.?) but the fact of the matter is that there are governments around the world that are authoritarian. Twitter has never been available in mainland China, for instance.On a real user basis, I would expect Twitter usage to fall by about 50% here in the U.S., and for the service to be banned in some other countries, and for the others to fall in line with the U.S.'s decline. That gets you to 36*.5 + 50*0 (the banned) and 102 *.5 (the non-banned internationals.) That leaves you with a real user base of 69 million for Twitter. Of course they will twist the numbers to appear better using mDAUs IOUs, PDQs, or whatever new metric they can concoct. On Twitter's reported figures the revenue per mDAU (best to use a rolling four-quarter figure for revenues to produce an annualized number) was $18.11 in the third quarter, which is astounding. Obviously no one would ever pay to use Twitter, and I was unaware that advertisers were interested in the global demographics. Extract that figure -- that's aggressive, by the way, the r/u will fall as the user base falls -- and apply it to our real user base figure of 69 million, and you get a real, annualized revenues figure of $1.25 billion for Twitter. This contrasts with the full-year figure of $3.46 billion in 2019 and my estimate for 2020 revenue at Twitter of $3.25 billion. This company was already shrinking...but now the dam will burst, in my view.Even after this week's pullback, TWTR shares, inexplicably, were trading at slightly above 10x trailing revenues as of Thursday's close. But, using our ""true"" revenue estimate of $1.25 billion, we derive a fair value for TWTR of $15.63. This ignores the fact that TWTR had over $7 billion of cash on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30, and valuation is as much an art as a science, but I am just doing a back of the envelope here.So, there's your math. Last Friday TWTR closed at $51. This Thursday It closed at $45. My fair value implies that it should be worth $16.That is a short. Regardless of what you think of the company's management, and I think I have made my opinions abundantly clear, TWTR shares are just plain overvalued. Bet against them as you are deactivating your account. It will feel good",0.9984

And if you're a parent, you also know about Robux (Roblox currency) as your credit card may have gotten charged by purchases made in-game. All I could think about was 'revenue' and when is the IPO.Developers have been looking for a new platform to take their talents further and also have greater freedom while reaching an entire new and broader age group of gamers.Enter RBLX.Roblox reminds me of Fortnite and Minecraft in popularity & style.I believe Roblox will be even more successful than Fortnite & Minecraft though.Roblox is more than gaming, and similar to Fortnite, will take entertainment and social media to a new level that many can't grasp...especially if you're over the age of 40.Roblox is capturing majority of the 6 to 18 year olds, and in the next 5-10 years will continue holding onto these users. Similar to how Facebook users from 2007 were still using FB in 2017...and still to today.That's 10 years of more interaction and huge revenue potential.I also like the fact Roblox has been quite safe for kids as they have been very proactive from my research.And these kids spend at least 2 hours a day on Roblox.For me, RBLX is comparable to $FB, $TWTR, along with $EA. Combine these 3 companies, and I see $RBLX.I'm in at $64.50 and will hold this one for 10 years. Keep buying. Keep holding.I expect RBLX to be at $140+ within 6 months.",0.9943

4963,"JIM COLLINS Jan 15, 2021 | 11:45 AM ESTStocks quotes in this article: TWTRAfter Thursday's column, I feel it is the right time to delineate my case against Twitter (TWTR) . So much of what I read in the financial media (not on Twitter, as I deactivated my account last week) on stocks is subjective, numbers-free blather, and in fact quite useless. So I have made it clear that Twitter is awful AND awfully overvalued, but let's focus on the second part.How about a little actual financial analysis to bolster an opinion on a stock? Trust me, it feels good, almost as good as deleting your Twitter account!First, we start with revenues. I am limited in space in this column, so won't have time to delve into Twitter's profitability metrics, but we live in a world where tech companies are valued based multiples of ""revs,"" so I will stick with that. The key to any analysis of financial statements is disaggregation.For Twitter we start -- and finish -- with the one metric given by management: mDAUs, or monetizable daily active users. Twitter changed to this metric in February 2019, and, in and of itself, it is meaningless. But it is a good base for modeling. Twitter's recent quarterly report showed 187 million mDAUs with 36 million users in the U.S., and 152 million abroad. I am assuming the difference is due to rounding.That's where Jack Dorsey's ship will start to sink. Twitter -- and every social media company -- receives a strong valuation based on user base figures that are full of people who don't actually use the service, but do have an account. But with this latest movement -- of which I am glad to be a part -- folks are deactivating their Twitter accounts, not just ignoring them.Those user numbers are going to plummet. I would expect this to happen when first-quarter figures are reported in April, not as much when full-year results are reported Feb. 9. How low can they go? Well Twitter's mDAU base is small to begin with, so that the initial drop-off will be quite noticeable.It is the international figure that is more difficult to divine. Twitter's public affairs division Thursday astoundingly criticized the government of Uganda for restricting social media to prevent interference in an upcoming election (didn't Twitter just do that, repeatedly, here in the U.S.?) but the fact of the matter is that there are governments around the world that are authoritarian. Twitter has never been available in mainland China, for instance.On a real user basis, I would expect Twitter usage to fall by about 50% here in the U.S., and for the service to be banned in some other countries, and for the others to fall in line with the U.S.'s decline. That gets you to 36*.5 + 50*0 (the banned) and 102 *.5 (the non-banned internationals.) That leaves you with a real user base of 69 million for Twitter. Of course they will twist the numbers to appear better using mDAUs IOUs, PDQs, or whatever new metric they can concoct. On Twitter's reported figures the revenue per mDAU (best to use a rolling four-quarter figure for revenues to produce an annualized number) was $18.11 in the third quarter, which is astounding. Obviously no one would ever pay to use Twitter, and I was unaware that advertisers were interested in the global demographics. Extract that figure -- that's aggressive, by the way, the r/u will fall as the user base falls -- and apply it to our real user base figure of 69 million, and you get a real, annualized revenues figure of $1.25 billion for Twitter. This contrasts with the full-year figure of $3.46 billion in 2019 and my estimate for 2020 revenue at Twitter of $3.25 billion. This company was already shrinking...but now the dam will burst, in my view.Even after this week's pullback, TWTR shares, inexplicably, were trading at slightly above 10x trailing revenues as of Thursday's close. But, using our ""true"" revenue estimate of $1.25 billion, we derive a fair value for TWTR of $15.63. This ignores the fact that TWTR had over $7 billion of cash on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30, and valuation is as much an art as a science, but I am just doing a back of the envelope here.So, there's your math. Last Friday TWTR closed at $51. This Thursday It closed at $45. My fair value implies that it should be worth $16.That is a short. Regardless of what you think of the company's management, and I think I have made my opinions abundantly clear, TWTR shares are just plain overvalued. Bet against them as you are deactivating your account. It will feel good!",0.9984
