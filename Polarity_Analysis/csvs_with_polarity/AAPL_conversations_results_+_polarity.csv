195,"From the buffet letter - Berkshire’s investment in Apple vividly illustrates the power of repurchases. We began buying Apple stock late in 2016 and by early July 2018, owned slightly more than one billion Apple shares (split-adjusted). Saying that, I’m referencing the investment held in Berkshire’s general account and am excluding a very small and separately-managed holding of Apple shares that was subsequently sold. When we finished our purchases in mid-2018, Berkshire’s general account owned 5.2% of Apple.Our cost for that stake was $36 billion. Since then, we have both enjoyed regular dividends, averaging about $775 million annually, and have also – in 2020 – pocketed an additional $11 billion by selling a small portion of our position.Despite that sale – voila! – Berkshire now owns 5.4% of Apple. That increase was costless to us, coming about because Apple has continuously repurchased its shares, thereby substantially shrinking the number it now has outstanding.6But that’s far from all of the good news. Because we also repurchased Berkshire shares during the 21⁄2 years, you now indirectly own a full 10% more of Apple’s assets and future earnings than you did in July 2018.This agreeable dynamic continues. Berkshire has repurchased more shares since yearend and is likely to further reduce its share count in the future. Apple has publicly stated an intention to repurchase its shares as well. As these reductions occur, Berkshire shareholders will not only own a greater interest in our insurance group and in BNSF and BHE, but will also find their indirect ownership of Apple increasing as well.",0.9923

210,"Warren Buffett Says Berkshire's Apple Investment Shows The 'Power Of Repurchases' 03/01/21 11:11 AM March 1, 2021 02:28 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Long IdeasBerkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett over the weekend wrote his annual letter to shareholders and highlighted the “power of repurchases” using Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as an example.What Happened: Buffett said that Berkshire began buying shares of the iPhone maker in late 2016 and by early June 2018 owned more than one billion shares (adjusted for splits). “Saying that, I’m referencing the investment held in Berkshire’s general account and am excluding a very small and separately-managed holding of Apple shares that was subsequently sold. When we finished our purchases in mid-2018, Berkshire’s general account owned 5.2% of Apple,” wrote the veteran investor.The cost for acquiring that stake was $36 billion and since then Berkshire has enjoyed regular dividends averaging about $775 million annually and has pocketed an extra $11 billion in 2020 by selling a small part of its holdings. The continuous repurchase of shares by Apple and the consequent shrinking number of shares outstanding has meant that Berkshire now owns 5.4% of the Tim Cook-led company. “That increase was costless to us,” wrote Buffett.Why It Matters: Berkshire’s third-quarter operating profits declined 32% to $5.48 billion from $8.07 billion a year ago. The company repurchased $9.3 billion worth of stock in the period. Since Berkshire also repurchased its own shares during the past two and a half years, its shareholders now own a full 10% more of Apple’s assets and future earnings than they did in July 2018, wrote Buffett.“This agreeable dynamic continues. Berkshire has repurchased more shares since yearend and is likely to further reduce its share count in the future,” revealed the Oracle of Omaha.Buffett also pointed to Apple’s publicly stated intention to repurchase shares and thus Berkshire shareholders would find “their indirect ownership of Apple increasing as well.”",0.998

Change $135.... $21.70.... $15.40.... $6.20$140.... $19.51,,,,, $13.70,,,, $5.80$145.... $17.45.... $12.05,,,, $5.40$150,,,, $15.70,,,, $10.60,,,, $5.10Stock hit $138.19 then closed at $136 on Dec 29th then ran to $145, so these calls were much higher when they were sold. I watch thee everyday. Until recently, the Jan 22 call had a 15% premium to market pirce. Now that is 13% But also the price change was too.IF Da Vinci Strategy was used when stock was bought, the price change was offset mostly by the profit on sale of the calls.For example: When the stock was $145 the Jan 22 $145 calls sold for $22.

As new iOS 14.5 features continue to be revealed via the beta release, it looks likely that this could be Apple’s most stunning iOS 14 update yet for those who care about security and privacy.That’s because Apple confirmed this week that its Safari browser is going to be even more private by bypassing Google’s Safe Browsing in favor of its own servers. Specifically, the new iPhone privacy feature redirects Google Safe Browsing traffic through Apple’s own proxy servers to enhance user privacy and avoid giving any data to Google.Previously, Apple would send an encoded version of the site’s address to Google’s Safe Browsing to be compared with Google’s list of fraudulent sites. But the issue with this was, Google could see your IP address.

Today, Ives raised his price target on Apple's stock to $175from $160, but also laid out a bull case for why the stock could climb to as high as $225. His new base target represents potential gains for investors of roughly 26% over the stock's closing price of about $139 on Friday. It's his compelling argument for the bull case, however, that should have investors more excitedlives cited the potential for ""eye-popping"" iPhone sales, saying that checks of Apple's supply chain in Asia showed strong demand for the device. The analyst now believes Apple could have sold as many as 90 million iPhones during the December quarter, roughly 35% over the analyst's already robust forecast. Ives sees this upward trend continuing over the March and June quarters.""We believe based on the current trajectory and in a bull case Cupertino has potential to sell north of 240 million units (~250 million could be in the cards -- an eye-popping figure)"" Ives wrote in a note to clients, ""which would easily eclipse the previous Apple record of 231 million units sold in [fiscal year 2015].""Will Apple stock hit $225?There have long been prognostications of a supercycle for the iPhone maker. It has an installed base of more than 1.4 billion active devices, with the iPhone accounting for an estimated 950 million of those. The current thinking suggests that as many as 350 million iPhone buyers could upgrade their device this year. To put that number in context, Apple sold roughly 185 million iPhones in 2019. Given the demand for a 5G-enabled iPhone, and the number of devices due for an upgrade, it's certainly possible Apple could sell 89% more iPhones in 2021 -- but that's certainly a high bar.",0.9985

Managing our blood sugars is a full time job, that requires you to make decisions that will ultimately affect your life and well-being.There’s an estimated 422 million people with diabetes. Of those 422mil only 6% receive the proper care and are in range with their sugars. Sugars that are too high on a day to day basis have a significant compounding effect that leads to:- Pancreatic Cancer- Blindness- Loss of limbs- Heart attack and heart disease- StrokesCurrently, CGM’s are a luxury that few can afford because of the monthly costs to change their CGM every few weeks. With a long term implantable CGM this totally changes the game and makes it a lot more accessible to EVERYONE.Truly a remarkable company, product, and vision.

This can only end in tears. Herd immunity induced evolutionary pressure is a biological truth. It took 2 years to even begin recovery for the Spanish Flu. People were getting infected 3rd and 4th times due to mutant strains, which always come out when herd immunity is achieved due to said evolutionary pressure. This works for both naturally acquired and vaccine induced herd immunity. True normality only comes back after the virus adapts itself to the human population and becomes endemic, by becoming less deadly to their hosts.Many cyclical sectors like travel and brick and mortar retail are up to their eyeballs in debt, and interest rate is rising. AMC needs to charge $100 per movie ticket just to pay the debt they already took out at low interest rate. Most airlines need to charge quadruple price for tickets. If people go wild, mutant strains will spike and cause another lockdown. If people don't go wild, many cyclical industries will go under.What I don't understand is, why institutions seem to think rising interest rate means it's a good idea to move money from the likes of Apple and Tesla, who will never need to borrow a cent in the foreseeable future, into zombies like cruiselines and airlines, who are up to their eyeballs in debt, most of whom have no future.",0.9858

I've used ROKU devices for years because they worked well with my PLEX server. However, it's hard for me to understand such a high share price with such weak overall fundamentals.So what gives with Apple's streaming strategy when Apple has almost 1.5 billion active devices they could target for Apple+ subscriptions. I just don't understand why Apple+ is lagging. Why isn't Apple loading up with competitive video content? Is Apple going to say they don't have the money while doing massive share buybacks? What is Apple thinking about when any company with cash can purchase decent video content. Why would Apple be easily beaten by ROKU unless Apple is clueless about what it takes to attract subscribers? I'm not angry, but I am puzzled with Apple's lethargic attitude towards increasing video content. It doesn't seem like rocket science to find content that would interest subscribers. If Apple could get even 10% of Apple device users to sign up for Apple+, they would blow away ROKU'S subscriber numbers. SVOD on AppleTV, iPhones, iPads, iMacs, and MacBooks should be easy-peasy for Apple. I honestly can't figure Apple out in this case. Good content is king. An empty video library is worthless.

1549,"Another missed point on earnings and profit reports by companies is that CREATIVE ACCOUNTING IS LEGAL.Companies and even governments have no legal requirement to follow strict accounting rules when reporting to the public.No company is required to release irs offical tax filings to the public.what we see is a hodge podge.All companies are required to report using GAAP. GAAP filing rules are strictly set by a government entity like SEC,and can be found on SEC’s EDGAR in usa or SEDAR in canada.That being said even following GAAP rules there is still legal manipulation of numbers.companies can report revenue or expenses in different columns of the ledger to make the end results we look at different.alot of numbers go into eps calculations.write downs,deferrals etc are all legal ways to change end results.NON GAAP is what most companies release to the public.in statements,press releases most companies use NON GAAP reporting practices.NON GAAP is just a no rules mess that cant be used to compare companies at all.companies say that GAAP misses out on important metrics to accurately show a companies financial status,especially with technology companies because the rules for GAAP are outdated.This may be true but NON GAAP is the wild west of reporting and needs to be taken with skepticism.Even GAAP filings can be misleading and still be legal.Companies release NON GAAP for easy access in press releases and on company website.GAAP are harder to find because you need to search the SEC OR SEDAR filings and understand more accounting technical terms.ideally all companies would be required to release the IRS OR CRA filings then the truth would come out but its not required and i cant think of any company that ever did this.So in my opinion,to think that a company like Tesla didn’t manipulate numbers to show a profit after 17 years of loosing money,to get into the S&P,the year before the whole world knew that every auto manufacturer and dozens of new companies were getting into the EV game,is dumb.Musk does all of these things to keep the company in the headlines,the tweets,bitcoin buying,SEC public skirmishes etc,its all public manipulation.He took the chance,and by doing all the moves he made,the stock price has skyrocketed.congratulations Elon and Stock holders.this still doesnt change the facts that hes a rouge,big mouth,no filter narcissist,who will make a mistake one day and Tesla will implode.you play with fire and eventually you get burned.enjoy the ride gangmy opinion only$TSLA. $AAPL. $LSPD. $AAL",0.9872

In the December quarter, services revenue jumped 24% to $15.7 billion. And the early signs on services revenue for the March quarter are looking good, as well.Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a research note Tuesday that Apple (ticker: AAPL) App Store revenue grew 30% in February for ""another strong month."" He estimates that App Store developer revenue was $4.4 billion in the quarter, up 30%, after gains of 40% in January and 31% in December.The analyst notes that Wall Street models call for services growth to decelerate to 16% in the March quarter, but he thinks the ongoing strength in app downloads point to ""an increasing likelihood of upside to consensus estimates.""Daryanani estimates that Apple should be able to grow services at a 19% compounded growth rate through the September 2024 fiscal year, at which point revenues from the segment would top $100 billion. He thinks that will include $29 billion from Apple Music and $6 million from Apple Pay.He also expects Apple Arcade and Apple TV+ to gain transaction over the next five years, with 80 million to 90 million subscribers each. At $100 billion, he adds, services would be 30% of Apple's overall revenue and 45% of gross profit.",0.9939

1679,"20-yr holder of Apple here again, with some more analysis of past data. Let's focus on periods where the stock price didn't produce a new high for over 6 months (120 trading days). Since December 13, 2000 (my first purchase of AAPL shares), there have been 7 such periods:5/21/2001 to 3/5/2004, 712 trading days (3 years!), with a 50.7% loss inbetween (4/17/2003)Any sane investor may have bailed in April 2003, having lost half their money by then. But it recovered so well, the stock split x2 on 2/28/2005...one year after the new high. The iPod was coming into its own.2/16/2005 to 8/12/2005, 123 days, with a 24.3% loss inbetween (5/12/2005)Surprising, after the split on 2/28/2005, the stock went into a lull, bottoming out in 5/12/2005, but recovered by 8/12/2005.1/13/2006 to 11/16/2006, 213 days, with 40.8% loss inbetween (7/14/2006)People were getting bored with the iPod. The hype of the new iPhone rumors drove the price up going into 2007's iphone release. The price rose throughout most of 2007, more than doubling by 12/28/2007, but then the next lull happened...12/28/2007 to 10/21/2009, 457 days (almost 2 years!), with 60.9% loss!! (1/20/2009)Again, lots of people bailing out on that tailspin, but Apple was starting to overtake the iPhone market with its 3GS. This was the heyday of Apple, because we didn't have another extended lull until...9/19/2012 to 8/19/2014, 480 days, with 44.4% loss (4/19/2013)I think Steve Jobs' passing had a lot to do with that (Oct 2011), but they did introduce the dividend in June 2012. There were some gains in that 480-day period, but they never reached the previous high. Still, it didn't revover until the announcement of the June 2014 x7 stock split.2/23/2015 to 2/13/2017, 498 days, with 32.1% loss (5/12/2016)Another two year lull...but only 32%. And now the last one...10/3/2018 to 10/11/2019, 257 days, with 38.7% lossBy this time, today, in 2021, I don't care about lulls. APPLE ALWAYS COMES BACK. AAPL had that 31% drop with the COVID stuff in 2020...only lasted 70 days or so...who cares? Golden buying opportunities, all of them!The moral of the story: APPLE ALWAYS RECOVERS. I see people here lamenting that it hasn't gone up every single day since the latest split, lol. We hit 142 recently, and that's PROBABLY going to be a new high for a while!

Serial leaker Jon Prosser of Front Page Tech, who has a pretty strong track record for new releases tweeted that “AirTags are still on for March” and, when quizzed about iPad Pro, said, “Also March.”The Pro will have a miniLED display. With miniLED, each pixel is individually illuminated, giving rise to deeper black hues and greater contrast levels. This is a really exciting development.Plus, it’s possible that this will come alongside a new iPad mini, which hasn’t been updated in a long time, so it may make sense to reveal the two models together.

1991,"APPL reiterated Outperform rating and a price target of $175 at WedbushWedbush analyst Daniel Ives notes that Apple's stock has taken a breather since its ""jaw dropping"" performance in the December quarter came and passed for the Street in late January. That said, the analyst views this as a short-term blip in the stock's upward trajectory as his Asia supply chain checks continue to show robust strength in this iPhone 12 supercycle into the rest of 2021. Given the fundamental strength he is seeing for this supercycle, coupled by a further re-rating on the horizon, Ives believes Apple will hit $3T in market cap by year-end. Importantly, with his estimation that 350M of 950M iPhones worldwide are currently in the window of an upgrade opportunity, the analyst thinks this will translate into an unprecedented upgrade cycle for the company. He also believes there is an upward shift of ASPs for iPhones in this cycle as the iPhone Pro continues to be the predominant model sold globally, which bodes well for top-line numbers heading into the March and June quarters. He has an Outperform rating and a price target of $175 on the shares.",0.9868

So did the stock market crash the last 8 years when the yield was considerably higher than now? No. Did people stop inviting in equities? No. So, by examining this historic fact, you can see that today’s reaction to rising yields is a complete over reaction to normal fluctuations in the bond yield. The 10 year is historically still very low. I would expect this reaction if we were looking at the yields from the 1980’s when the 10 yr was approaching 18% !",-0.5529

2252,"Both Samsung and Qualcomm are reporting chip shortages which will likely hold up Android mid-range smartphone production and sales. Samsung's Galaxy Note may not be sold this year, supposedly due to certain chip shortages which would include various Snapdragon processors. Apple seems to be in good shape due to buying up plenty of processor chip capacity from TSMC. It's unknown whether Apple will suffer chip capacity issues in the future if iPhone demand remains high. Fortunately, Apple had planned for high iPhone production well in advance. It's definitely to Apple's advantage to be able to buy up production thanks to having economies of scale larger than several rival companies combined. Apple seems safe for now as far as iPhone inventory is concerned. As Apple relies mostly on TSMC and has great ties with the company due to large orders, Apple should be in great shape for both the coming A14X Bionic and M1X products. Apple should have a good advantage this year as ARM-based processors come to the forefront of high-tech consumer products. It could take a couple of years for other companies to produce comparable laptop and desktop ARM-based products running Windows efficiently.It's being said that Apple appears to be mostly unaffected by chip shortages, so I hope what's being said is actually true.",0.9978

One analyst says it offers a good buying opportunity.The tech giant’s shares have slumped 16% since they hit a closing peak of $142.95 on Jan. 26. In comparison, the Nasdaq Composite has fallen less than 3%, and the S&P 500 is up 2% over the same period. Apple stock slipped 1.8% in recent Friday trading to $119.72.The company hasn’t actually said anything material in recent weeks, but there has been considerable speculation that there could be softening iPhone demand. The news service Nikkei Asia earlier this week reported that Apple recently cut its production plans for the first half of the year by 20%, due largely to weak demand for the iPhone 12 mini, the low-end version of the 5G-capable iPhone lineup announced last fall. Apple hasn’t commented on the Nikkei report, and didn’t respond to a Barron’s request for comment on it earlier this week.In a research note Friday, Morgan Stanley hardware analyst Katy Huberty repeated her Overweight rating and $164 target price on Apple stock, asserting that the recent selloff is a buying opportunity, and that recent chatter about developments in the Taiwan supply chain are more noise than substance.“Over the last two weeks, we’ve seen reports from [other analysts] that Apple is in the process of cutting iPhone production,” she writes. “These reports have contributed to Apple’s recent underperformance and investors are asking what we are hearing from the supply chain and how it impacts our view on iPhone shipments this year.”",0.9921

I see that when there is a huge negative event that occurs that the nasdaq corrects to the 200 sma line. 2 events I see were 12/24/18 & 3/23/20. If the treasury yields rises to very high levels does that mean at the very least that the nasdaq will correct the 50 sma line? The 50 sma and 200 sma line are stretched extremely far apart right now which is telling me that assets are hyper inflated as well. Wouldn't these 2 lines eventually snap back closer together?

We estimate total App Store developer revenue grew to $4.4bn in February; up 30% Y/Y (vs. +40% in January, +31% in December). The growth in App Store revenue remains relatively broad based, with all categories reporting impressive growth with the exception of Music (+10%).The App Store is only one piece of the services business, but with QTD growth at 35%, we see an increasing likelihood of upside to consensus estimates. The Entertainment segment (41%) remains the best performing segment, likely driven by tailwinds related to numerous streaming service launches. China remains the slowest growing of the major Geo’s with revenue +24%; however, it is still well above the single digit growth rate reported for much of 2020. The solid growth in China also comes despite a difficult comp (lapping COVID tailwinds) and the 24% rate is an improvement vs. the 20% in January.Net/Net: We think growth 20%+ is looking increasingly likely.Maintains Outperform rating and $163 price target.",0.9948

I’ll go back to a point I made earlier: As rates on virtually risk free instruments begin to rise, the opportunity costs of investing in equities also rise. There’s nothing “wrong” with Apple. It’s just no longer a momentum play (for now), there are no near-term catalysts for the stock (that are known at this time) ahead of March quarter results and it’s not an income stock. Great company, great long-term appreciation play, but not a COVID recovery play. Apple at times is an ATM for the market. With a market cap of over $2 trillion, it’s among the most liquid and easily tradable equities on Wall Street. Need cash for the glamour/momentum stock of the day? Sell Apple.
