Despite an ASP of more than three times the feature phone market, smartphones surpassed the peak feature phone market size less than 10 years after the iPhone launched. Apple Watch shipments today exceed the entire Swiss watch market. In other words, applying a market share figure to the current EV market forecast is likely to vastly underestimate the size of Apple’s car business in the future.”",0.9528

It’s just no longer a momentum play (for now), there are no near-term catalysts for the stock (that are known at this time) ahead of March quarter results and it’s not an income stock. Great company, great long-term appreciation play, but not a COVID recovery play. Apple at times is an ATM for the market. With a market cap of over $2 trillion, it’s among the most liquid and easily tradable equities on Wall Street. Need cash for the glamour/momentum stock of the day? Sell Apple.

I'm guessing it's a market macro thing that just happens to include Apple and nothing directly due to Apple's fault. I've learned to live with this market weirdness and Apple has always risen above it. I have no idea when Apple will start to rise based on earnings, but I know it will eventually. Were Apple's numbers not good enough? I doubt that. Is there profit-taking going on? Maybe. I'm Apple-long so I'm not going to lose sleep over whatever is happening today or tomorrow. All the guessing of how much Apple was going up on earnings didn't quite work out for today. The future is too difficult to predict with any accuracy.

I've used ROKU devices for years because they worked well with my PLEX server. However, it's hard for me to understand such a high share price with such weak overall fundamentals.So what gives with Apple's streaming strategy when Apple has almost 1.5 billion active devices they could target for Apple+ subscriptions. I just don't understand why Apple+ is lagging. Why isn't Apple loading up with competitive video content? Is Apple going to say they don't have the money while doing massive share buybacks? What is Apple thinking about when any company with cash can purchase decent video content. Why would Apple be easily beaten by ROKU unless Apple is clueless about what it takes to attract subscribers? I'm not angry, but I am puzzled with Apple's lethargic attitude towards increasing video content. It doesn't seem like rocket science to find content that would interest subscribers. If Apple could get even 10% of Apple device users to sign up for Apple+, they would blow away ROKU'S subscriber numbers. SVOD on AppleTV, iPhones, iPads, iMacs, and MacBooks should be easy-peasy for Apple. I honestly can't figure Apple out in this case. Good content is king. An empty video library is worthless.

We estimate total App Store developer revenue grew to $4.4bn in February; up 30% Y/Y (vs. +40% in January, +31% in December). The growth in App Store revenue remains relatively broad based, with all categories reporting impressive growth with the exception of Music (+10%).The App Store is only one piece of the services business, but with QTD growth at 35%, we see an increasing likelihood of upside to consensus estimates. The Entertainment segment (41%) remains the best performing segment, likely driven by tailwinds related to numerous streaming service launches. China remains the slowest growing of the major Geo’s with revenue +24%; however, it is still well above the single digit growth rate reported for much of 2020. The solid growth in China also comes despite a difficult comp (lapping COVID tailwinds) and the 24% rate is an improvement vs. the 20% in January.Net/Net: We think growth 20%+ is looking increasingly likely.Maintains Outperform rating and $163 price target.",0.9948

Warren Buffet is one of Apple's biggest investors that has voiced his opinion that he will not invest in Bitcoin, although he does not have to because he can reap the benefit from Apple taken a large stake in Bitcoin. Eventually, Tim Cook will hold out but cannot appear to wait too long knowingly giving the impression he did not know it was going to continue to become more valuable and pay much more than what he does not have to. Bitcoin is current and what is on the other side of the pandemic, so it remains to be seen whether he will soon buy for what is inevitable or be reluctant and later recall he has made the biggest mistake for the Apple shareholder over the long term. While Apple has a massive market cap Tesla's investment in Bitcoin will soon bring its market cap to over a trillion and the rest will be history. Keeping in mind it took Jeff Bezos decades to amass his wealth and Elon Musk surpasses him in less than two decades. In comparison, Apple could have the same fate as far as it a market cap Tesla could possibly outpace Apple's market cap and it will be Tim Cook's failure to have invested in Bitcoin.The longer Tim Cook does nothing to invest in Bitcoin all note how Tesla shares and market cap rises and at what rate, according to Elon Musk we may all become the witness to my comments sooner than later.Tim Cook does hold Apple's fate with his decision will he advance to do the right thing or will leave it a chance and invest and potentially lose investors, best be wary Sears was once king and Sear is now becoming a distant memory in retail and know ever discuss whatever eCommerce may exist.",0.9949

Specifically, the new iPhone privacy feature redirects Google Safe Browsing traffic through Apple’s own proxy servers to enhance user privacy and avoid giving any data to Google.Previously, Apple would send an encoded version of the site’s address to Google’s Safe Browsing to be compared with Google’s list of fraudulent sites.

[3] Very good chance we see some I-SPY Covid results by June, and those results could be best in class. [4] OMS 906 phase 1 results should be out by Sept. A once monthly subcutaneous complement pathway drug, as a follow-on to Narso, would enhance our buyout value tremendously. [5] IGaN trial enrollment greatly delayed by Covid (N=280), so likely no results until late Q1, 2022. [6] Once approval is in hand, for TMAs, a substantial capx raise, north of $30/share, should take place, enabling a full phase 2/3 Narso trial in Lupus. [7] I was surprised by Greg's emphasis on GPR174 for cancer, and am hopeful we see an IND, by July.

Their decline began in 2020 and in a few short years they’re going to be in a free fall as the public confidence in them rapidly erodes. A major realignment will take place and MICROSOFT is going to emerge as the dominant leader because of a spectacular growth in its revenue and profitability. Coupled with the fact that CEO Nadella is a level headed person focused on Microsoft’s growth and not activism, investors will see the value in its stock. I believe even more investment will flow into the $MSFT stock starting this year.My prediction for other stocks:1 Investors will start realizing that $AMZN’s valuation is significantly higher than its peers. I believe the stock won’t surpass the ATH it saw in 2020. It is quite likely that the stock price may decline during 2021.2 $AAPL stock will likely grow higher during 2021, but its high flying days are over. Apple car is just a concept and it will be several years before a physical product is launched. In the meantime, Tesla Cybertruck and a possible low priced car may already be in the roads, thereby making Tesla the undisputed leader. It will be very difficult to penetrate its market. I see no innovation from Apple and investors will see that too.3 Stocks like $GOOG, $FB, $TWTR will likely stagnate and commence MASSIVE declines.

1873,"20-yr holder of Apple here again, with some more analysis of past data. Let's focus on periods where the stock price didn't produce a new high for over 6 months (120 trading days). Since December 13, 2000 (my first purchase of AAPL shares), there have been 7 such periods:5/21/2001 to 3/5/2004, 712 trading days (3 years!), with a 50.7% loss inbetween (4/17/2003)Any sane investor may have bailed in April 2003, having lost half their money by then. But it recovered so well, the stock split x2 on 2/28/2005...one year after the new high. The iPod was coming into its own.2/16/2005 to 8/12/2005, 123 days, with a 24.3% loss inbetween (5/12/2005)Surprising, after the split on 2/28/2005, the stock went into a lull, bottoming out in 5/12/2005, but recovered by 8/12/2005.1/13/2006 to 11/16/2006, 213 days, with 40.8% loss inbetween (7/14/2006)People were getting bored with the iPod. The hype of the new iPhone rumors drove the price up going into 2007's iphone release. The price rose throughout most of 2007, more than doubling by 12/28/2007, but then the next lull happened...12/28/2007 to 10/21/2009, 457 days (almost 2 years!), with 60.9% loss!! (1/20/2009)Again, lots of people bailing out on that tailspin, but Apple was starting to overtake the iPhone market with its 3GS. This was the heyday of Apple, because we didn't have another extended lull until...9/19/2012 to 8/19/2014, 480 days, with 44.4% loss (4/19/2013)I think Steve Jobs' passing had a lot to do with that (Oct 2011), but they did introduce the dividend in June 2012. There were some gains in that 480-day period, but they never reached the previous high. Still, it didn't revover until the announcement of the June 2014 x7 stock split.2/23/2015 to 2/13/2017, 498 days, with 32.1% loss (5/12/2016)Another two year lull...but only 32%. And now the last one...10/3/2018 to 10/11/2019, 257 days, with 38.7% lossBy this time, today, in 2021, I don't care about lulls. APPLE ALWAYS COMES BACK. AAPL had that 31% drop with the COVID stuff in 2020...only lasted 70 days or so...who cares? Golden buying opportunities, all of them!The moral of the story: APPLE ALWAYS RECOVERS. I see people here lamenting that it hasn't gone up every single day since the latest split, lol. We hit 142 recently, and that's PROBABLY going to be a new high for a while!

1875,"What Apple really needs to do to accelerate its growth rate and strengthen its technology leadership in the entire tech sector is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for Apple (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Apple just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

That said, the analyst views this as a short-term blip in the stock's upward trajectory as his Asia supply chain checks continue to show robust strength in this iPhone 12 supercycle into the rest of 2021. Given the fundamental strength he is seeing for this supercycle, coupled by a further re-rating on the horizon, Ives believes Apple will hit $3T in market cap by year-end. Importantly, with his estimation that 350M of 950M iPhones worldwide are currently in the window of an upgrade opportunity, the analyst thinks this will translate into an unprecedented upgrade cycle for the company. He also believes there is an upward shift of ASPs for iPhones in this cycle as the iPhone Pro continues to be the predominant model sold globally, which bodes well for top-line numbers heading into the March and June quarters. He has an Outperform rating and a price target of $175 on the shares.",0.9868

2246,"From the buffet letter - Berkshire’s investment in Apple vividly illustrates the power of repurchases. We began buying Apple stock late in 2016 and by early July 2018, owned slightly more than one billion Apple shares (split-adjusted). Saying that, I’m referencing the investment held in Berkshire’s general account and am excluding a very small and separately-managed holding of Apple shares that was subsequently sold. When we finished our purchases in mid-2018, Berkshire’s general account owned 5.2% of Apple.Our cost for that stake was $36 billion. Since then, we have both enjoyed regular dividends, averaging about $775 million annually, and have also – in 2020 – pocketed an additional $11 billion by selling a small portion of our position.Despite that sale – voila! – Berkshire now owns 5.4% of Apple. That increase was costless to us, coming about because Apple has continuously repurchased its shares, thereby substantially shrinking the number it now has outstanding.6But that’s far from all of the good news. Because we also repurchased Berkshire shares during the 21⁄2 years, you now indirectly own a full 10% more of Apple’s assets and future earnings than you did in July 2018.This agreeable dynamic continues. Berkshire has repurchased more shares since yearend and is likely to further reduce its share count in the future. Apple has publicly stated an intention to repurchase its shares as well. As these reductions occur, Berkshire shareholders will not only own a greater interest in our insurance group and in BNSF and BHE, but will also find their indirect ownership of Apple increasing as well.",0.9923

2269,"What Apple really needs to do to accelerate its growth rate and strengthen its technology leadership in the entire tech sector is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for Apple (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Apple just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem.

2445,"I find it amusing to hear people asking why Apple's stock went down after announcing a terrific quarter. It's an investor's choice to pick a stock they think can make them money in as short a time as possible. It's said that Gamestock and AMC are making billionaires out of the top investors and those companies are #$%$ investments. Stock manipulation can make and break billionaires. Making money from stocks doesn't require a good company investment, sometimes it just requires good luck and maybe great risk-taking. For me, Apple is a low-risk investment that pays off year after year while Gamestock and AMC may be bankrupt companies six months from now. OK, Apple is down after a blowout quarter and that doesn't make much sense to most people in the short-term. They just see they lost some money. I just see it as a blip in a year's stock movement and how Apple is strengthening itself for the future. By any standards, Apple is making an awful lot of money and that's good for me as a shareholder. I don't have to worry about Apple going out of business soon and I'm guaranteed my dividends. As I've owned Apple since 2004, plenty of market oddities have hit Apple but Apple has always recovered. Many other stocks didn't recover. I feel certain at some point this year, the blowout quarter will boost Apple's share value when it's least expected. Patience is needed when owning Apple. It's something shareholders need to get used to instead of getting frustrated or overly concerned. Three years ago everyone was saying Apple had nothing in the pipeline but they were all wrong. Apparently, Apple can still keep secrets. Apple is busily working on projects behind the scenes and the may be game-changers for all we know.Anyway, put the holiday quarter behind and move forward. Apple is still the market cap leader by a good amount with plenty of cash to work with. Don't be too disappointed in Apple because investors didn't respond to Apple's earnings report. That's their loss because they're busy trying to fulfill their greedy nature with get-rich-quick stocks. It's nothing I want to be involved in. I prefer to own companies that have solid fundamentals and pay dividends over the long-term and that's definitely Apple.????",0.9952

With a car on the horizon, this could run up significantly and split again. Remember though after this next split the float will be enormous. Big floats (ie PFE) are very very hard to move.

Higher gross margins are sustainable given growing FX tailwinds and a continued mix uplift across products, Huberty said.""Net, we raise our forward revenue and margin estimates with FY21 EPS increasing 6% to $4.47 and FY22 EPS increasing 8% to $4.61, both materially above consensus.""Buybuybuy ",0.997

That would be a surprise because it’s only a year since the last Pro upgrade, which saw the introduction of a LiDAR scanner and two cameras, with an updated processor. Serial leaker Jon Prosser of Front Page Tech, who has a pretty strong track record for new releases tweeted that “AirTags are still on for March” and, when quizzed about iPad Pro, said, “Also March.”The Pro will have a miniLED display. With miniLED, each pixel is individually illuminated, giving rise to deeper black hues and greater contrast levels. This is a really exciting development.Plus, it’s possible that this will come alongside a new iPad mini, which hasn’t been updated in a long time, so it may make sense to reveal the two models together.

2889,"Daryanani maintains his Overweight rating and $163 price target on Apple shares.Apple's growth strategy in recent quarters has been driven in part by expansion of its services business, which includes subscription offerings in music, video, gaming, and fitness, among other things. In the December quarter, services revenue jumped 24% to $15.7 billion. And the early signs on services revenue for the March quarter are looking good, as well.Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a research note Tuesday that Apple (ticker: AAPL) App Store revenue grew 30% in February for ""another strong month."" He estimates that App Store developer revenue was $4.4 billion in the quarter, up 30%, after gains of 40% in January and 31% in December.The analyst notes that Wall Street models call for services growth to decelerate to 16% in the March quarter, but he thinks the ongoing strength in app downloads point to ""an increasing likelihood of upside to consensus estimates.""Daryanani estimates that Apple should be able to grow services at a 19% compounded growth rate through the September 2024 fiscal year, at which point revenues from the segment would top $100 billion. He thinks that will include $29 billion from Apple Music and $6 million from Apple Pay.He also expects Apple Arcade and Apple TV+ to gain transaction over the next five years, with 80 million to 90 million subscribers each. At $100 billion, he adds, services would be 30% of Apple's overall revenue and 45% of gross profit.",0.9939

Buffett also has trimmed investments in some banks, including long-time favorite Wells Fargo, and beefed up investments in health care stocks like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck, while selling his remaining stake in Pfizer.Along with the Apple trim, Buffett opened new stakes in Verizon, Chevron, Marsh & McLennan, and EW Scripps. The Verizon stake was a big one, with Buffett paying $8.62 billion for 147 million shares. The carrier's stock now accounts for 3% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio.Additionally, he dropped Pfizer, JPMorgan Chase, Barrick Gold, M&T Bank, and PNC Financial entirely and grew stakes in T-Mobile by 117%, in Kroger by 34%, and in Merck by 28%.",0.9936

Today, Ives raised his price target on Apple's stock to $175from $160, but also laid out a bull case for why the stock could climb to as high as $225. His new base target represents potential gains for investors of roughly 26% over the stock's closing price of about $139 on Friday. It's his compelling argument for the bull case, however, that should have investors more excitedlives cited the potential for ""eye-popping"" iPhone sales, saying that checks of Apple's supply chain in Asia showed strong demand for the device. The analyst now believes Apple could have sold as many as 90 million iPhones during the December quarter, roughly 35% over the analyst's already robust forecast. Ives sees this upward trend continuing over the March and June quarters.""We believe based on the current trajectory and in a bull case Cupertino has potential to sell north of 240 million units (~250 million could be in the cards -- an eye-popping figure)"" Ives wrote in a note to clients, ""which would easily eclipse the previous Apple record of 231 million units sold in [fiscal year 2015].""Will Apple stock hit $225?There have long been prognostications of a supercycle for the iPhone maker. It has an installed base of more than 1.4 billion active devices, with the iPhone accounting for an estimated 950 million of those. The current thinking suggests that as many as 350 million iPhone buyers could upgrade their device this year. To put that number in context, Apple sold roughly 185 million iPhones in 2019. Given the demand for a 5G-enabled iPhone, and the number of devices due for an upgrade, it's certainly possible Apple could sell 89% more iPhones in 2021 -- but that's certainly a high bar.",0.9985

Most of the traditional automakers are secretly laughing at Apple for thinking they can actually build a car anyone would want to buy. Apple isn't going to get any respect. I think big investors aren't happy how Apple is wasting resources on an EV that will take Apple years to develop when it could be doing things that will turn a profit much sooner. I only know that it will take many years to develop an unknown EV product, especially if Apple is as picky as usual when deciding on a working partner. I'm not concerned about Apple's EV project because it's such a long way off and could easily become a HomePod on wheels that's too expensive and not do enough in terms of autonomy. By the time Apple sells an EV, every automaker will have many models for sale and Tesla will be the dominant EV automaker by a huge margin. I simply hope Apple knows what it's doing.",0.9557

3915,"Warren Buffett Says Berkshire's Apple Investment Shows The 'Power Of Repurchases' 03/01/21 11:11 AM March 1, 2021 02:28 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Long IdeasBerkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett over the weekend wrote his annual letter to shareholders and highlighted the “power of repurchases” using Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as an example.What Happened: Buffett said that Berkshire began buying shares of the iPhone maker in late 2016 and by early June 2018 owned more than one billion shares (adjusted for splits). “Saying that, I’m referencing the investment held in Berkshire’s general account and am excluding a very small and separately-managed holding of Apple shares that was subsequently sold. When we finished our purchases in mid-2018, Berkshire’s general account owned 5.2% of Apple,” wrote the veteran investor.The cost for acquiring that stake was $36 billion and since then Berkshire has enjoyed regular dividends averaging about $775 million annually and has pocketed an extra $11 billion in 2020 by selling a small part of its holdings. The continuous repurchase of shares by Apple and the consequent shrinking number of shares outstanding has meant that Berkshire now owns 5.4% of the Tim Cook-led company. “That increase was costless to us,” wrote Buffett.Why It Matters: Berkshire’s third-quarter operating profits declined 32% to $5.48 billion from $8.07 billion a year ago. The company repurchased $9.3 billion worth of stock in the period. Since Berkshire also repurchased its own shares during the past two and a half years, its shareholders now own a full 10% more of Apple’s assets and future earnings than they did in July 2018, wrote Buffett.“This agreeable dynamic continues. Berkshire has repurchased more shares since yearend and is likely to further reduce its share count in the future,” revealed the Oracle of Omaha.Buffett also pointed to Apple’s publicly stated intention to repurchase shares and thus Berkshire shareholders would find “their indirect ownership of Apple increasing as well.”",0.998
3916,"Tim Cook is taking his sweet time on the Apple car, it likely won't be released until 2023 or 2024. Tesla will be making over 1 million cars a year by then, Gigafactories up and running. Hyundai, Huawei, Nio, Toyota, Honda and Ford will all be in full swing manufacturing EVs. Slow and cautious will definitely lock Apple out of EV gains, bad decision by Tim Cook to move slow in the EV market.",0.5484

Apple still has an outside chance to challenge Netflix, Disney+ or Amazon Prime Video thanks to all those active Apple devices.Apple's EV chances are near zero with Musk running Tesla. Tim Cook is too busy pushing privacy which almost no one cares about. Tim Cook is doing the best he can but he's no match for Elon Musk. Musk can sell ice to Eskimos with tweets. Apple just needs to get those Apple Silicon 27"" iMacs and 16"" MacBook Pros with beefed-up M-series chips ready for sale. Apple can't touch Tesla but can certainly give AMD and Intel computer makers a run for the money.",0.9908

Apple still isn't made up of a higher percentage of institutional owners as before the split. I'm not complaining as I've been through splits since 2004 so I have accumulated plenty of shares due to those splits. Are investors actually buying more shares at this price than if Apple's share price were 4X as much? I'm just trying to figure out if anything much changed since the four for one split. I honestly can't tell except for the fact I have more shares. Tesla's split worked very well as investors kept buying more stock, but it didn't work for Apple as investors, for the most part, stopped buying Apple after the split. So, I wonder if Apple got what it expected from the split, that's all. Do most of you long-term shareholders think the last split was worthwhile, so far? Maybe further down the line it may matter?

4261,"With earnings about a week away, I just wanted to share some thoughts...Firstly, about analyst expectations. Folks, if Apple reports massive revenue it's great for us don't get me wrong, but some analysts calling for $100 billion or more in revenue, that's kind of unrealistic. It's almost like they're setting up Apple to fail. What if Apple only reports $85 to $90 billion does that warrant a drop in the share price? And let's not forget Apple did not provide guidance for this quarter. So expectations are too unrealistic. We're still in the middle of a pandemic. We're not out of the woods yet. If Apple can perform as good as they did last year I'd be satisfied, but if they do even better then that then I'd be very pleased. Secondly, I believe the selling is way overdone. We should see the stock price climb with positive results and upcoming announcements. The stock held onto the support level very well technically. So I believe the stock has a lot more room to run. There's so many revenue channels that can leaf to more growth. The continued buybacks will help with any dips in the long run.Third, I mentioned this in the past but I don't believe Apple will comment about Project Titan since the deal is still being ironed out with manufacturers. So don't expect them to shed any light on their plans till later on. I know many are eagerly waiting for this but still.Fourth, when earnings are announced, pay very close attention to some of the sleeper hit revenue channels that aren't being focused on as much like Apple Fitness. I believe these areas will be key to leading us to more growth and higher revenue in the future. Definitely not priced in at this current price.Own it don't trade it! Apple long!",0.9987

I honestly believe if those two both said to sell Apple, the stock would fall like a rock, although it would eventually recover. How two people have such short-term influence over the market is beyond me. Apple doesn't have enough pumpers standing on the sidelines and spreading the word for Apple. Of course, as long as Apple is buying back shares, I'm OK with that.Apple is doing more than fine in selling products and Services and all their retail stores are still not open.I firmly believe the stock will rise by the end of the year to close in on the $3T mark, about $170 to $180 no matter what is happening now with the stock. I like to joke around about other stocks being better short-term but overall Apple is solid and reliable with relatively low risk involved. Apple isn't the only stock like this but it has been for me. I think it's best just to wait it out and Apple will surely shine at some point this year. Purchase other stocks if you can't wait. There's nothing wrong with that. Just don't complain if you miss the opportunity before Apple rises. I missed out on Tesla like an idiot because I didn't think it could be worth more than all automakers combined. 730% gain? No way! Stupid me. No one to blame but myself.I'm sure Apple will gain at least 40% to 50% this year and that's decent in my book.

I watch thee everyday. Until recently, the Jan 22 call had a 15% premium to market pirce. Now that is 13% But also the price change was too.IF Da Vinci Strategy was used when stock was bought, the price change was offset mostly by the profit on sale of the calls.For example: When the stock was $145 the Jan 22 $145 calls sold for $22.
