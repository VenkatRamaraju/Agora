Will exist the positions gradually and rotate to SCHD and other high dividend stocks that have yield above 3%. As for the eventual Time Warner and Discovery shares distribution, only want to own the number one and two in the space with decent multiple, currently only own DIS for longs, NFLX for swing trades only due to high multiple.

I have no idea what the logical thinking has been for the past many years, because the past sure make you think long and hard about the leadership...... However The dividend cut is not a good reason to sell , especially when you’ll be getting .71 shares of the new entity for every T share you own ... Because of the spin off The new entity and T will be able to grow in value because the new entity will be in the top 3 or maybe worse case # 4 streaming companies that people will pay for every money.......

28,"The spinoff of Warner may result in more long term value to existing ATT shareholders, but I do not think I want to hold on to the resulting new ATT shares. The new ATT will be a pure telco play and VZ may be the better stock if you want to own a telco stock for the dividend. ATT’s fiber to the home network lags behind Verizon’s as a result of decisions made years ago. To save capital and extend the life of their copper network, ATT went with an interim “active” fiber design which utilized more of their imbedded copper network. That design resulted in a lot of electronics in the field requiring power and battery backup. You probably have seen their “graveyards” of large cabinets near many subdivisions. Unfortunately, the capital investment they initially saved utilizing their existing copper for the “last mile” was ultimately squandered on bad acquisitions that lost money (Direct TV and Warner). That interim fiber solution has past it’s useful life and ATT is playing catch up deploying that last mile of fiber. There are still many areas where ATT fiber internet is not available. Verizion went with a “passive” fiber solution from the start, using passive splitters to bring fiber to the home. The initial cost was more than the ATT solution, but they are now in a better position to provide the higher data speeds demanded today. ATT will lag behind on quality internet service until they deploy more fiber in their network.",0.997

That difference has got to be made up in the value (i.e. stock price). That is what all this is about - absorbing that loss. The ATT stock price will not quit going down until that loss is fully absorbed. That's how I see it. So far from 33 to 28 X 1.7 billion shares = appx. $8.5 billion of that loss absorbed. We still have a ways to go. I'm of the opinion that our CEO and board could have absorbed these losses slowly and in small amounts over time, but they decided to make the shareholders eat the loss over a very short period of time.

112,The drop to 29 was pure panic selling dropping 15 percent off it's premarket highs yesterday. A great value for new shareholders buying in. The media made a big deal about the dividend cut and lot of mom and pop investors probably panic sold on the news. No you aren't losing your dividend it will just be lowered to 3.5 percent from 7 percent. In exchange you get issued shares of a new merger company with Discovery and still get to keep your T shares. The combined value of both companies stocks will be more than that 3.5 percent dividend cut. People selling because of the dividend cut are fools. The shares of the new company will have more growth potential in the future and won't have to worry about the dividend preventing them from investing in new IP content for movies and streaming. T investors will still get a stable dividend and a healthier company moving forward to expand their 5G services.

122,"Is there any reason to believe that the current dividend will be reduced until the new company comes into being in mid 2022? I would think it would remain the same until then.I have been trying to figure out how many shares in the new Co. per T share a T shareholder will receive. It depends of course on the capital structure of the new company, namely how many outstanding shares. Currently, DISCA has 500M shares. Assuming that the new Co. retains this capitalization, then T's shareholders will get about 350 M shares (70%) which would be divided among T's 7B shares (0.05 shares). Thus, If I am correct, then each T shareholder would get 1 share of the new Co. for each 20 T shares and current DISCA shareholders would get something like a 1 for 3 reverse split. All this assumes the new Co. keeps its current 500M share count. If the new Co. raises the number of shares to a higher level as is perhaps the most probable thing, then the math would change.Has anyone seen anything on the anticipated share count?",0.9899

Shares of the soon-to-be telco plunged as much as 7% in Tuesday trading as investors questioned the long-term outlook for the company. ""For AT&T investors, while we view this transaction, and the February announcement that it would sell DirecTV, as positives, we think it will take time for AT&T to recover. AT&T has lost significant ground in both wireless and fiber broadband as it spent time and money building HBO Max,"" Spartan Capital head of equity research Barry Sine said in a note to clients. Sine also voiced concern about AT&T's governance in light of the WarnerMedia flop.""We note that eight of the 13 board members who went along with both acquisitions are still comfortably ensconced on AT&T’s board. Change apparently came from new CEO John Stankey who evidently tired of trying to defend and manage the telecom/media conglomerate he inherited,"" Sine said.AT&T surprised Wall Street Monday by saying it will spin off its media division WarnerMedia — which is bought for $85 billion just three years ago — and merge it with Discovery.

But even though the total dividend payout for the new ATT will be less, estimated to be around $8b vs the current $15b, the dividend rate on the new ATT shares may still be high. Unless the new Warner/Discovery pays a dividend, which is unlikely, the total dividend dollars you receive will be less.

However within 4-5 years the ATT divi will be back up IMHO..... And the value of the spinoff will also pay a dividend plus you’ll get stock in new entity￼.....

Current T shareholders will own 71% of the NewCo and current DISCA shareholders will own 29%. So as shareholders, we now will have the choice whether to own both a telecom and a pure play media company, or both.This move should unlock shareholder value because the NewCo will be valued as a pure play media/streaming giant and should see multiples similar to Netflix. Meanwhile, T (telecom and internet company) will be focus on their legacy business and have more room on the balance sheet (after shedding $43B in debt) to invest in more 5G and Fiber.In my view, the NewCo is going to skyrocket once the market starts valuing it like a growing media/tech company. With the international launch of HBO Max into 39 countries next month and into Europe later this year, I think the bulls will start flooding into T in anticipation of the spinoff so they get their piece of the new company.

Estimating the value of a slimmed down T, plus the value of shares of newco, It suggests it's the current value of T should be anywhere between $30.37 and $41.28, and therefore, the selling is overdone. Here's more:At a Disney-like multiple of 17 times 2023 Ebitda, WarnerMedia/Discovery would have an enterprise value of $221 billion and its equity would be worth $156 billion after subtracting net debt. AT&T shareholders’ 71% stake would be worth $110.8 billion, or about $15.40 per current AT&T share, if the stock gets the same credit from the market as Disney’s. At an 8.5 times EV/2023 Ebitda ratio in line with ViacomCBS’ and Discovery’s today, the same math yields a value of about $4.49 per share.Add the $25.88 value of AT&T’s telecom businesses, and AT&T stock today could be worth between $30.37 and $41.28—depending on whether investors believe WarnerMedia/Discovery will look more like ViacomCBS or Disney in the future.

He never liked this stock and refused to recommend it, until the last earnings when he finally caved in specifically stating the dividend now looked safe..then a few weeks later it gets cut, making him look like a fool.

It is a shame that in the last earning call couple of weeks ago John Stankey indicated the dividend was secured at current 52 cents per quarter levels and that the issue with the high yield could be solved by simply increasing the stock price.

576,"The deal will provide AT&T with $43 billion in cash and other assets to pay down debt. AT&T shareholders will own 71% of the combined WarnerMedia/Discovery, with Discovery shareholders owning the rest. Discovery CEO David Zaslav will lead the company, and the merger is expected to close in the middle of 2022.AT&T said it would “reset” its dividend as part of the transaction, to a payout ratio of about 40% of free cash flow, which management estimates at least $20 billion in 2023. That means roughly $8 billion in annual payout, or some $1.11 per share (AT&T has about 7.19 billion shares outstanding, per its latest filing). Should the post-spinoff equity trade for the same annual dividend yield as Verizon Communications ’ (VZ) current 4.3%—given a similar leverage and business profile—it would be worth $186 billion, or about $25.88 per share.Several Wall Street analysts did a version of that math this week, and came up with similar values for AT&T’s telecom businesses after spinning off WarnerMedia. Valuing the newly created media company is a tougher task, and depends on investors’ views of its future streaming prowess.Management said Monday that they expect WarnerMedia/Discovery to generate about $13 billion in adjusted Ebitda—short for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization—in 2023, and to be levered at 5 times net debt to adjusted Ebitda at closing. That implies about $65 billion of net debt on the new entity.The market ascribes vastly different multiples to streaming winners and legacy media players. Walt Disney (DIS), which has a runaway streaming success in Disney+, trades for 17.3 times its enterprise value to 2023 Ebitda estimate, while streaming pure-play Netflix (NFLX) goes for 22.3 times. Relatively subscale media companies ViacomCBS (VIAC) and premerger Discovery each trade for about 8.5 times their 2023 EV/Ebitda ratio.WarnerMedia/Discovery will bring HBO Max and Discovery+ under one roof, plus a deep library of content from their multiple brands and a combined annual production budget of about $20 billion, per management. But the business today is more of a collection of cable networks and a Hollywood movie studio, with the streaming services not expected to turn a profit for several years.At a Disney-like multiple of 17 times 2023 Ebitda, WarnerMedia/Discovery would have an enterprise value of $221 billion and its equity would be worth $156 billion after subtracting net debt. AT&T shareholders’ 71% stake would be worth $110.8 billion, or about $15.40 per current AT&T share, if the stock gets the same credit from the market as Disney’s. At an 8.5 times EV/2023 Ebitda ratio in line with ViacomCBS’ and Discovery’s today, the same math yields a value of about $4.49 per share.Add the $25.88 value of AT&T’s telecom businesses, and AT&T stock today could be worth between $30.37 and $41.28—depending on whether investors believe WarnerMedia/Discovery will look more like ViacomCBS or Disney in the future. The reality is likely to be somewhere in between. But after a nearly 10% selloff in the past two days, AT&T stock is trading below both of those values.",0.9977

ATT was selling for about 37 bucks a share (between 35-43) pre 2017 merger so 37x .86= 31.82 plus or minus adjustments for respective market conditions of 2017 and 2021 and then add back the value of the discovery shares gained in the spin off. i do not think people will get as much on the discovery shares as they think from what i have been reading. but i have held on two different spinoffs (pfizer and another one) and came out ahead both times. my feeling is you will do ok with this one if you find a good entry point but be prepared for some dumping by the disappointed dividend crowd.,0.9846

738,"I don't understand this sell off at all. Because of the dividend cut? You can't be serous. A simple breakdown of this deal could be looked at as follows: Discovery is going all in, their stock can be used as a benchmark. T is spinning off and will get 71% (after this I'm using round numbers). T gets $48 bil off their books (this in itself should spike T higher) and gets rid of yet another headache. Now the shares. For simplicity sake, let's break it all up by 5'ths. Discovery is all in, $22 bil (in deal for 1/5), T gets $48 bil in debt off their books for exchange of Warner (2/5). T stockholders get free stock in this new company (now it comes to valuations), call it $120 bil MC (I've heard highs of $150 to lows of $100 bil, this is in the middle) of whats left, call it $50 bil (2/5). With 7 bil shares outstanding in T, that works out to around $8-10 a share. Of course there will be other considerations, so let's call it, conservatively, $5 a share...of free money. Using Discovery common as a benchmark ($30), each share is worth 1/6 of the new company. Or 600 shares of T brings you 100 (free) shares of the new company (that has the potential to be a powerhouse), plus your original T shares (stronger with less debt, a stronger more focused company ready for the 5 G rollout), plus a what, 3-4% dividend in the meantime ...and T is selling off???",0.9964

826,T investors are asking how many shares would they receive from the spin off transaction. Well that depends to some extend on how many shares are issued by NewCo. What we know is that T shareholders will receive 71% interest in NewCo and Disca shareholder shareholders 29%. But keep in mind that there are significantly less Disca shares o/s than T shares. Disca o/s are around 489M compared to the 7B+ o/s shares in T. So because of that and the interest already allocated in NewCo (29% for Disca and 71% for T shareholders) there is more value per Disca share in NewCo than per T share. Simple math shows that based on these facts each Disca shareholder should receive around 6 shares in NewCo for every share 1 share receive by each T shareholder. Not bad for Disca shareholders so not sure if all their recent Class Action Suits on this transaction have any merit. Disca shareholders appear to be in a great position with higher interest per share in NewCo world class assets than T shareholders that will lost around 50% of their dividend plus a decline in T stock price equivalent to the spun off assets receive when the transaction close.,0.9975

Ofcourse you will be taking on some debt that DISCA brings, but I think it is worth it. And the new company is unlikely to be valued, with a EPS number as low as T is. That alone will create a lot of value. If you believe VZ is currently fairly valued, then you should be loving T at current levels. After the deal, At&t will have almost the same FCF per year as VZ and actually a lower net debt. They are currently trading with a market cap close to each other.

Given that, would the new dividend % drop not be as bad, since stock is lower too?Example: today, $30 share, $2 div (roughly). After spinoff, say $20/share, $1 div + some shares in new Discovery so no net loss in value to shareholders . So the div will drop for current shareholders but if you buy in after, it might be closer to current percentage yield? If you hold from before, your yield drops but you now own some Discovery shares...Also I get how Discovery could compete better with an expanded catalog, but what about the remaining ATT? It will be smaller but how will this help it compete?

Basically, to the shareholder, the Reverse Morris Trust is a tax free transaction. The assets of TW are spun off to a company 'Spinco' that then turns them over to the buying company (Discovery). T shareholders are 71% owners of the merged companies (TW and Discovery). As I understand it, shareholders retain ownership of all their T shares. As an example, if your number of shares in the merged companies totals 1,000 and the share price is $35, you have received, tax free, $35,000 worth of shares. If you sell the shares for a $2 profit, only the $2,000 is taxable. In other words, it is like a complex and complicated tax free distribution.If any one can add clarity to this explanation, please feel free.",0.9967

1192,"There's a certain author at Barron's, whose name I won't mention because I fear my post could then be censured, but he keeps churning out stories on behalf of AT&T, or maybe, its big shareholders, who hope to exit with the highest price possible and thus need the price propped up whilst this happens. So this Barron's stooge has cranked out an article today about how it's merely disappointing for AT&T to be cutting its dividend but rest assured, they are executing a ""strategy"" to focus on 5G and broadband. There is zero mention of the incredible destruction of AT&T value here, with this mess of a Warner Media foray. The article today also points out how AT&T, in line with what analysts were pushin, executed its sale of a share of DIrecTV as part of its ongoing ""strategy"". No mention of the destruction of wealth by the DirecTV deal.Let's be clear here. AT&T is a mess. An absolute mess. Who knows what the stock price would be if competent, caring management were in charge the last 20 years. AT&T hasn't executed a strategy of note in two decades, or maybe ever. DirecTV was a mind boggling destruction of wealth. The Warner Media foray was a horrific destruction of shareholder assets. There is no strtegy here. Just reaction, just fumbling around to keep their head above water.Ironically this Warner Media deal is happeing with John Malone at Discovery. He must be chuckling. Way back when, 20-25 years ago, Malone sold AT&T his cable company, TCI, which admittedly had core cable assets that were definitely worth something, but theses asets were in decrepit shape and required massive investments. Malone sold TCI to AT&T back then for $50 billion. And afetr AT&T fumbled around and invested billions more in it to upgrade those cable assets, they wound up selling them to Comcast. For nothing close to what they put into it. Comcast walked away with some solid cable infrastructure. AT&T has never done anything right for two decades. So I don't know what the motivation is behind the onslaught of articles from Barron's that ignore the tremendous destruction of wealth at AT&T and talk instead about ""stratgegic shifts in focus"", but it's financial propaganda at its best, IMO. This author managed to point out how AT&T is worth between 30 and 40 when you consider the AT&T core business plsu Warner Media. As in, AT WORST, it's worth $30. I don't beleive it for a second. I don't think AT&T is going under, but I think the company is a wreck and there's a reason it's stock price hasn't moved in 20 years.

A simple breakdown of this deal could be looked at as follows: Discovery is going all in, their stock can be used as a benchmark. T is spinning off and will get 71% (after this I'm using round numbers). T gets $48 bil off their books (this in itself should spike T higher) and gets rid of yet another headache. Now the shares. For simplicity sake, let's break it all up by 5'ths. Discovery is all in, $22 bil (in deal for 1/5), T gets $48 bil in debt off their books for exchange of Warner (2/5). T stockholders get free stock in this new company (now it comes to valuations), call it $120 bil MC (I've heard highs of $150 to lows of $100 bil, this is in the middle) of whats left, call it $50 bil (2/5). With 7 bil shares outstanding in T, that works out to around $8-10 a share. Of course there will be other considerations, so let's call it, conservatively, $5 a share...of free money. Using Discovery common as a benchmark ($30), each share is worth 1/6 of the new company. Or 600 shares of T brings you 100 (free) shares of the new company (that has the potential to be a powerhouse), plus your original T shares (stronger with less debt, a stronger more focused company ready for the 5 G rollout), plus a what, 3-4% dividend in the meantime ...and T is selling off???",0.9968

Does this sound like a management team that has a vision for the future?Feels like they're vacillating back and forth, trying to decide what direction they want to go. It only costed them $85 billion for the last new strategy, how much is this one going to cost. And this is the type of management you want to tie your wagon too? Remember, the guys at the top have nothing to lose by playing these games. They're already millionaires so they can walk away and still live great lives if the whole thing falls apart.

1238,"For those who holds AT&T just for the dividends, this seems like very bad news. ATT say the expect to pay 8 BUSD in dividends, which is half of what they pay today (per year). they will reduce debt by 43 BUSD, but of the total or more than 160 BUSD they have in debt, this will only reduce it by aprox 25 %. The interest they pay today, is 8 BUSD/year, so simplifying, it will go down to 6 BUSD, i.e. reducing interest paid by 2 BUSD. In short, dividends will be cut in half, by 8BUSD, and only reduce debt interest payments by 2 BUSD. In short, from a dividend point of view, this does not look good at all. It may be however, that the operations, and business part of the deal, is better, since ATT can concentrate in the carrier business, and the Warner media can focus on their business.

1272,"Morningstar still finds T 'Attractive':AT&T Continues to Post Solid Customer Growth During Q1;Shares AttractiveAnalyst Note Michael Hodel, CFA, Director, 22 Apr 2021""AT&T’s push to add customers showed during the first quarter, with solid wireless, broadband, and HBOMax gains. The firm also increased network investment plans for the year, though it did so in a way(using vendor financing) that will cause reported capital spending to decline somewhat, allowingmanagement to maintain its $26 billion free cash flow target. AT&T stressed that it is trying to avoidoveremphasizing financial metrics to instead make prudent long-term investments. The increasedspending appears to be going into the wireless network to ensure that the firm takes full advantage ofthe C-band spectrum deployment, doing other work at the same time. Our fair value estimate remains$36, and we believe the stock is attractive. AT&T pulled in 2.1 million gross postpaid wireless phone customers during the quarter, up about 15%from a year ago and topping Verizon, likely for the first time in a decade. Customer defections alsodeclined sharply. As a result, AT&T added 595,000 net postpaid phone customers, also its best start to ayear in a decade. However, revenue per customer continues to decline amid aggressive promotionalefforts, down 2.8% year over year, which will likely prove the worst of the three major U.S. carriers.Total wireless service revenue increased 0.6% year over year, the best result since the start of thepandemic, and management still expects growth will accelerate through the year, implying stablepricing from here. In addition, wireless segment EBITDA increased slightly versus a year ago, despiteheavy customer additions and phone upgrades"".",0.9933

The transaction is expected to be tax-free to AT&T and AT&T’s shareholders.In connection with the spin-off or split-off of WarnerMedia, AT&T will receive $43 billion (subject to adjustment) in a combination of cash, debt securities and WarnerMedia’s retention of certain debt. The new company expects to maintain investment grade rating and utilize the significant cash flow of the combined company to rapidly de-lever to approximately 3.0x within 24 months, and to target a new, longer term gross leverage target of 2.5x-3.0x. WarnerMedia has secured fully committed financing from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and affiliates of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC for the purposes of funding the distribution.The transaction is anticipated to close in mid-2022, subject to approval by Discovery shareholders and customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals.

The spinoff refocuses AT&T on its core U.S. wireless business and on the next-generation wirelessservices that may be enabled by its 5G network.? The Discovery deal is the second unwinding of a large AT&T merger in just a few months, as thecompany agreed to sell its DirecTV cable/satellite television distribution business in February.? We are maintaining our 2021 EPS estimate of $3.19 and our 2022 forecast of $3.25.INVESTMENT THESIS We are maintaining our BUY rating on AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) to a target price of $38.AT&T is unwinding its WarnerMedia acquisition through a tax-free spinoff toshareholders and a merger with Discovery. The spinoff refocuses AT&T on its core U.S.wireless business and on the next-generation wireless services that may be enabled by its5G network. The Discovery deal is a bitter pill for AT&T to swallow after it paid up forthe Time Warner assets; however, it is also probably the right decision as AT&T did nothave the financial firepower to compete in direct-to-consumer video streaming with thelikes of Netflix and Disney, rapidly invest tens of billions into its new 5G network, andprotect the dividend. That said, we still expect a dividend cut at AT&T after thecompletion of the deal (if not before), though management promises the yield will remainhigh.

The analyst put a enterprise value of $220B after the merger based on the average forward P/E of other media companies which is a 25% premium to what the T holders will get. CNBC reported yesterday that John Malone was a majority shareholder in Discovery and he converted all his B shares to A shares to show he was supporting the merger and won't block a future sale of Discovery which means the new company is already planning on selling itself after the merger. They said the companies being looked at as potential buyers are Apple, Amazon, and Google.

Now let me rip on the management and CEO again. I am baffled how bad the company has done on this roll out. What bad PR. So you come out, announce a deal in a unclear manner, the market quickly rejects to it, and the company goes silent instead of getting out there to explain why it could be good! Horrible management, horrible public relations. It seems they have no interest in getting out there and saying why this is a good move. They need to be selling the future of the new company thats where alot of growth could be hiding. To me it may be a good mix, you get the stable 5G telecom play and we get a second stock that could have some growth and a higher valuation in the streaming category.",0.9812

In Network 101 you learn that spectrum is a limited resource so you need financial flexibility to participate in these spectrum auctions. They simply missed they will need cash to fund these recurring spectrum purchases. So they were forced for this spin off to pay down debt and not only that but also cut the dividend in half. John fingerprint is in all these major failed acquisitions including TW costing T $billions. John should resign as CEO immediately so that credibility and trust on T can be restored.

1916,"NEWS Wire This AM (Positive) !AT&T (T) is a veteran in the subscription business. From telephones to television, AT&T has been a dominant force in this world for ages. And thanks to its noteworthy acquisitions of Time Warner, HBO and Turner Broadcasting, AT&T has one of the biggest footprints in the streaming industry...with the potential to grow even larger.With its almost incomparable array of assets, AT&T's streaming services stand to draw a lot of interest. And while it does not approach the industry in the same way that Disney or Netflix has, the telecom giant is still likely to emerge as a winner. HBO alone already has over 44 million U.S. subscribers, and that number is expected to skyrocket in the years to come.CEO John Starkey noted in a press release, ""Our number one priority in 2021 is growing our customer relationships. It's about more than just adding to our customer base. It's about expanding the growth opportunity in our three market focus areas and also increasing our share within each market.""",0.9882

1987,"I have a simple model with regard to the TW deal.At the time of the deal, T was at $35 a share.It is now at $29 a share.In exchange of the transfer of TW assets to Discovery, T get 71% of Discovery.Discovery's market cap is 16.83 B and that represents 29% of the future company. The 71% that T gets is worth 41.2 B or $6 per share. The 43 B that T gets in a combination of cash, debt securities and WM retention of debts represents $6 per share of benefits to T. The total benefits to T is 84 B or $12 per share..T spent 120 B to buy TW. This included the debt that T incurred at the time. Now T gets 84B back. The loss is 36B or $5 a share.Recall T was at $35 a share at the time of purchasing TW and the net effect of the loss (of this TW to WM to Discovery ) is $5. The share price of T should be $30, if all else is equal.Final conclusion: Additional sell off is not warranted as far as the value for T is concern.The dividend is a different matter. Even here, at the time that T bought TW, the dividend rate was 2/35 or 5.7%. In the future the dividend is probably around $1.1 per share. After subtracting the $6 per share, the benefit of the Discovery/Warner Media stock from the present value of $30, the future equivalent of the T is 24. The dividend rate is 4.6% which is still lower than the 5.7% then but not too bad.Please let me know of any significant errors.If all this seems reasonable, then I think I will stay put and ride this out.",0.982

He had the opportunity to do so by requesting that Jason and other WM executives were left in key positions in the new company, but he did nothing. Instead, he is just telling them that he would be deeply involved in the process so that WM would be fairly represented.

2458,"What some thoughtful analysts are saying:""The dividend announcement was a “clear negative,” Raymond James analyst Frank Louthan IV wrote in a Monday afternoon note to clients. The company’s target implies a roughly 45% reduction in AT&T’s dividend relative to current levels, by his math.“This deviates from previous commentary in which we viewed management as the ‘gold standard’ in maintaining the dividend as a sacrosanct tenet of its value proposition to shareholders,” Louthan wrote. “This about-face from the strategy, which was to maintain or grow the dividend at all costs, will likely linger in investors’ minds for many years.”Louthan, who is bullish on AT&T’s stock with an outperform rating, noted that shareholders would at least be likely to see four more dividend payments at current levels since AT&T doesn’t expect the WarnerMedia deal to close until mid-2022.At current prices, AT&T’s stock has the highest dividend yield among components of the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.85% at 7.04%.AT&T shareholders will also get a stake in the combined company formed by WarnerMedia and Discovery DISCA, -1.60%, “so at least there is some compensation for the cut and the spinoff sets up the new company for a better long-term growth profile,” he wrote.Truist Securities analyst Greg Miller referred to the dividend “reset” as “clearly a negative event” but one that he deemed “likely necessary to avoid far worse conditions at a later date.”“Although the company reiterated the fact that it would be in the 95th percentile of all dividend payers with a ~4% yield (~7% prior to announced cut), when pairing this reduction with the anticipated tax rate hikes and increasing capital expenditures, we believe the payout ratio could be increasingly pressured after already dropping from our estimate of ~63% in 2022,” Miller continued in a Monday note to clients.He has a hold rating and $30 price target on AT&T’s shares.William Blair analyst Jim Breen called the dividend cut “somewhat surprising given the income focus of some shareholders.”“However, we note, post-close, AT&T’s dividend yield will be in line with Verizon VZ, -1.31% …at around 4.5%, which makes sense given the companies will now look similar from a business perspective,” he wrote in a Tuesday note to clients. “We believe AT&T became too broad in focus over the last few years, which restricted its ability to run efficiently.”In Breen’s view, the deal will put AT&T on healthier financial footing, giving the company more flexibility to invest in its 5G buildout. He has a market perform rating on the shares.",0.9855

So may panic sellers, come and go every year .. And so many new buyers thinking that T is going to make them rich in a New York minute, they too will also come and go ever year.... If I do the math I’m making money, after I pay the taxes, of course, as ordinary income.. Not capitalized gains as the dreamers will do if T goes to $36-40.00 before a years time.... So if they do sell at $36.00 before the year of maturity,￼ they’ll pay 50% CGT when they sell ...... Or the panic sellers will buy back thinking they should of stayed put and will get unrealized wash sales capital gains tax of 50% for not waiting 30 days after the buy T again, and the. T will fall under the wash sale rule...... So admire US longs for making the dividend if you want too.... But understand this for sure, staying invested in T is the very hardest part.....

2473,"People seem to believe that instant alchemy happens with a spinoff and with a dividend cut. Cash flows do not change when these things happen. The cashflows will be split into two separate streams but will be the same at that point in time.The changes are what will happen AFTER the spinoff:Warner/Discovery can leverage its global footprint (T would have had to build out its own footprint, but Discovery already has it), taking the content global much faster.W/D can be valued as a growing media business.W/D gets bigger with the addition of Discovery and becomes a better player in a narrowing oligopoly with Netflix Disney Amazon.T can focus on 5G buildout.Another difference thereafter is the plan to keep more cash in the business (probably all for W/D - i.e., no dividend - and a reduced dividend for T as they buildout 5G) rather than pay it out as dividends. For investors focused on the dividend cashflow, they may want out. Or they can sell their W/D and buy more T to increase their dividends.Keep in mind that the business will likely continue to improve over the next year, with momentum in the telecom business, an expanding HBO Max, and growing profits.

That also sets the number of shares a T holder gets from the deal at around 1:4 because Discovery has market cap of 34% of Warner. Amazing how these numbers are so perfect because .71 of 34% is 24.1%. So it appears to be close to 1:4 no matter how you slice it. I'm sure the market caps will vary a little as the merger gets closer, but it would take a huge run-up in T stock to materially alter that 1:4 ratio.",0.8889

Now, for a minute let's forget Disca just for illustrative purposes. Let's say T spins off Warner and that company gets 20x earnings for its shares....not at all unreasonable. And let's say $1 out of the $3 total earnings come from Warner. Now, T holders are getting $20 for a Warner share ($1 x 20 multiple) and $20 for a T share ($2 x 10 multiple). Together, that's $40. They hoped investors would do that ""rerating"" on their own and give credit for Warner as T tried to build it out....but seemingly, it wasn't going to happen. So instead, T mgmnt elected to do this spinoff, which in their mind, would cause the share price to react the way I just illustrated. They figured the lower dividend would be more than offset by effectively a $40 share price (just using 40 in my example). Evidently, it was just a miscalculation.....for now. I don't think they were being evil, or really dumb. I just think they felt obligated to do something for shareholders and it backfired. I'm mad too. It's possible they underestimated the importance of the div amongst this current shareholder base. And the delivery and messaging around the deal didn't help. They did leave everyone puzzled as to WHY the div needed to be cut so much. It's the same pie of earnings that exist postmerger and not explaining why 60'ish% of those earnings couldn't continued to be paid out as a div was a mistep.

Also, for those always complaining about strategy and overspending, etc, THIS is what they get out of the leverage of the TWX deal. Xandr Platform Spend Soars 75% in Digital Video and 235% in CTV for Q1 2021 NEW YORK --(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Xandr , AT&T’s data-enabled technology platform at the intersection of digital and TV, today shared results of premium video and connected TV (CTV) spend on its platform for Q1 2021, which saw significant increases. Product advancements across video and CTV buying and selling spurred the significant growth, as well as tools and partnerships in support of the bespoke needs of marketers across verticals like pharma and CPG.With analysts predicting digital video and CTV spend to grow 14.8%1 and 34.8%2 in 2021 respectively, Q1 spend on Xandr’s platform in these areas was impressive. Total digital video spend on Xandr’s platform – globally, across Xandr Invest’s DSP and Xandr Monetize’s SSP and ad server – grew 75% YoY in Q1 2021. The primary driver of this video spend growth across the platform is CTV, with total global platform spend up 235% YoY. Video now represents 35% of overall spend on Xandr’s platform.Growth in international platform spend is contributing significantly to Xandr’s overall global platform growth. Total platform spend in Xandr’s markets outside of the United States grew 30% YoY, with video spend up 55% YoY and CTV spend up 211% YoY.In a world where advertising must prove its worth, marketers are increasingly relying on Xandr Invest to demonstrate outcomes and validate return on ad spend. Global spend on Xandr Invest grew 35% YoY, with spend specifically on CTV jumping 205% YoY, as Xandr scales strategic relationships through the demand chain, from agencies and holding companies to brands and direct marketers.Due to growing direct integrations with premium video publishers, CTV inventory is increasingly available and monetized through Xandr . Global seller revenues on CTV inventory, through spend on Xandr Monetize, grew 391% YoY.A unified model for a converged futureAnother highlight of Q1 2021 was the completed launch of Crown Media Family Networks on Xandr's linear optimization platform and integration with Xandr's marketplace. Crown Media Family Networks’ premium inventory is now available for automated audience-based buying through Xandr's Invest TV platform. In Q2 2021, Xandr will be focused on a unified inventory model for converged yield across digital, linear and addressable TV.Important advances to CTV buyers’ visibility and confidenceTo increase advertisers’ understanding of the growing opportunity of premium video, Xandr released its global guide, CTV: Advertising’s Creative Canvas, in January 2021 , featuring global thought leadership from product experts at EBX, Finecast, Nine, 10 ViacomCBS, LiTV, GroupM, Xaxis, Jellyfish, France Télévisions Publicité, Matterkind, ShowHeroes, Omnicom Media Group , Peach, Vitor Media, DIRECTV GO, Hearts & Science, MiQ and Philo. Xandr continues to proactively tackle challenges arising from emerging formats like CTV – around identity, context, campaign planning and outcomes – and is laser focused on ensuring that buyers can transact with assurance and drive performance. In Q1 2021, Xandr released important advances to programmatic buying and premium video including a data science-based CTV pacing solution so that buyers can be confident their budgets are allocated correctly; and a novel video taxonomy system so that users of the Xandr marketplace can transact and report on a clearly-defined and manageable set of OTT content descriptors, gaining critical insight into where their ads are running.A vertical-specific approachQ1 2021 also saw a focus on pharmaceutical & healthcare marketers and the CPG vertical as the Xandr team builds and partners to create a one-stop platform for planning, buying and measuring across digital and TV formats.Introducing Xandr CurateAs buyers are increasingly looking for differentiating data and scaled premium inventory to reach their users programmatically, the Xandr Curate platform is gaining global traction. In Q1 2021, Xandr’s clients shared success stories across the Xandr Curate platform, including Captify , Beemray, Playground xyz, Omnicom Media Group , Global Data Bank, Retargetly, Matterkind, Jotacom, Orange Advertising , Orion Semantics, hyScore and Nano Interactive.",0.9998

If AT&T cuts the dividend half, it is still not bad. So, I lost some dividend but gain more potential on growth.

Streaming leader Walt Disney (DIS) trades at 17 times 2023 Ebitda, while the less streaming-forward ViacomCBS (VIAC) fetches nine times.If Discovery/WarnerMedia winds up in the middle, its stock would be worth $12.54 per AT&T share today.Adding that to the $24 value of the telecom business would put AT&T at about $36 a share -- more than 20% above Friday's close.",0.9928

3048,"Based on 71% of the new entity, T shareholders should receive somewhere between $5 to $15 of Discovery stock. So @ $29 a share, the T stock price after divesture is being valued at somewhere between $14 and $24 per share. When the dividend gets cut to $1.11 or so, that implies a dividend yield of between 4.6% and 7.9% at those share prices.On average, that's not quite as high as the yield has been in the past, but is still pretty significant.The total valuation of the post-divesture T at those prices is somewhere between $100 to $170 Billion.Now post-divesture T will have about 80% of the revenue, and 70% of the operating income of pre-divesture T, so I figure it should have about 70 to 80% of the Market Cap - Note this excludes any benefits T gets from the debt draw down and renewed focus on Communications, but also excludes any market cap hit based on loss of respect for management. The market cap before the announcement was somewhere around $230 Billion. 70-80% of that indicates a post-divesture market cap of between $160 to $185 Billion.So... I figure what's really happening is rotation out of the stock by income investors, and not quite so much interest by media investors yet as they try to figure out what the new Discovery is worth. Seems like more upside than downside at these levels, and that you'll get paid to wait. Might not be a screaming deal, but worth a few nibbles. Also seems a bit better value than VZ now...",0.992

And ironically, John Malone was involved in that fiasco also (only Malone always comes out on top when dealing with AT&T), as he sold TCI to AT&T back then for a whopping $50 billion. In the end, Comcast wound up with the cable assets and went on to become the dominant cable and internet provider today, with a stock price increasing accordingly, while AT&T stumbled around, waiting for more opportunities to blow shareholder money.

3123,"Morningstar's take: (Maintains $36 fair value)AT&T Unwinds Its Media Strategy; Discovery Deal HighlightsMedia ValueAnalyst Note Michael Hodel, CFA, Director, 17 May 2021""CEO John Stankey has wasted no time putting his mark on AT&T and we like the direction he’s headed.AT&T announced plans to spin off WarnerMedia and immediately merge the firm with Discovery tocreate a new media company. AT&T shareholders will own 71% of the new entity, which will assume$43 billion of AT&T’s debt load. The deal essentially completes the unwinding of former CEO RandallStephenson’s strategic vision, which we’ve long considered ill-conceived, as reflected in our Poorcapital allocation rating.While we like this move, we don’t expect to change our $36 fair value estimate. CombiningWarnerMedia with Discovery should enhance the value of the new firm, though not to an extent thatwe expect will have a huge impact on AT&T's worth overall. The transaction does highlight the value ofWarnerMedia, which we suspect would be trading well in excess of the roughly $100 billion AT&T paidfor it, net of divestitures, if it were a stand-alone firm today. We also wouldn't rule out the possibilitythat another firm makes a play for WarnerMedia--we still believe it would pair well with Comcast's NBCUniversal--but we wouldn’t count on it, either. We view AT&T shares as fairly valued.AT&T used this announcement as cover to cut its dividend substantially. The firm will target a payout ofaround $8 billion-$9 billion annually, down from nearly $15 billion in 2020. While this shift will likelydisappoint shareholders, we think it makes sense, especially considering the market hasn’t given thefirm much credit for the payout, holding the stock’s yield around 7% in recent years. The firm will set thedividend at around 40% of free cash flow, down from more than 60% in 2020, leaving substantial excesscash to reduce leverage or take advantage of opportunities, including share repurchases. That free cashflow figure also contemplates a sizable increase in network investment, notably in fiber infrastructure,which we believe is important to AT&T’s long-term health.Business Strategy & Outlook Michael Hodel, CFA, Director, 8 Apr 2021AT&T has been in investors’ penalty box for some time, and rightly so in our view. The firm made a stringof ill-advised capital allocation decisions, culminating with the 2018 purchase of Time Warner, that haveleft it open to justified criticism. However, we believe management is now putting the firm on the rightpath.The wireless business is AT&T’s most important, accounting for about 40% of revenue (more than halfafter partially divesting the television business to TPG). AT&T is now the third-largest player in the U.S.,but we believe it has adequate scale relative to Verizon and T-Mobile to generate solid profitability. AT&T also benefits from its ownership of deep network infrastructure across much of the U.S. and its abilityto provide a range of telecom services, particularly among enterprise customers. Also, we believe the TMobile merger greatly improved the industry’s structure, leaving three players with little incentive toprice irrationally in search of short-term market share gains. We don’t believe Dish Network presents acredible threat to the traditional wireless business.WarnerMedia, AT&T’s second largest segment, remains a media powerhouse with a deep contentlibrary and the ability to reach audiences across a wide variety of platforms. The firm’s direct-toconsumer plans around HBO Max are gaining momentum, which should nicely augment and eventuallysupplant traditional distribution mechanisms. This position should enable its studios and networks toremain a destination of choice for the best content creators well into the future.AT&T’s remaining businesses should contribute with reasonable consistency as well. The enterpriseservices business provides solid margins and should pair well with wireless services as 5G gainsmomentum. The consumer fixed-line business remains disadvantaged, but we like the firm’s renewedplan to invest in fiber to both stabilize this business and support the wireless network. The traditionaltelevision business (DirecTV) is also in a challenging position, but we believe the deal with TPG providesan incentive to quickly find strategic alternatives for the assets"".",0.9981

Will it drop down to $18-20 to give a shareholder a 5-6% yield?3.7% is a difference from 6-7%. Of course you will be getting shares of the new Media giant ( 71% ) maybe with no dividend.

I was pilloried for making such a ""foolish"" recommendation (turns out, not so foolish after all). And like many posters herein, I was not in favor of the TimeWarner deal at all.

Part of my decision is the anticipation of the current dividend being paid our unchanged for at leas 2 more quarters and possibly more.

It has a $34 price target for AT&T (15.5% upside implied).J.P. Morgan expects some improving wireless subscriber trends at AT&T alongside increased retention spending. But it's questioning the Street's expectations for EBITDA, and thinks C-band spending is a concern.Cowen has a $49 target for Comcast (3% downside).In another on its list, Cowen says Lumen Technologies (NYSE:LUMN) might revisit the sale of its consumer business.

Three times I asked for a Thumbs UP if you think T will continue to move up from here and Thumbs DOWN if you think it will start dropping back again.The first time I asked the question was yesterday when T was up .70. I got 15 Thumbs UP and 9 Thumbs DOWN. The second time was yesterday as the stock was dropping. I still got 18 Thumbs UP and 8 Thumbs DOWN. The third time was today as the stock was continuing to drop. I got 3 Thumbs UP and 8 Thumbs DOWN.It was obvious (at least to me) that T was only up yesterday in sympathy with VZ which was up strongly because Buffett had taken a big position in VZ. Yesterday I posted that if it wasn't for VZ, T would probably done nothing (as usual). But the ultra bullish longs here, who see every up move as a possible breakout to $40 no matter what the reason, thought otherwise and strongly voted that T would continue to move higher. Later as the stock was dropping, they continued to strongly vote that T would continue to move up. Today, after a very weak close yesterday and after a quick and fairly good sized drop this morning, they suddenly changed their mind and voted strongly for a reversal in thinking and a drop back in the stock to $29.To me, this shows the general mentality of this board. Way too optimistic at the slightest sign of a green day and a general confusion in thinking when T turns red again. I don't think many here have the capacity to understand how, why or what it takes to move a stock in either direction at any particular point in time. Further, most here are more inclined to form an opinion based on emotions alone rather than thinking through things and forming a more logical conclusion. But there's still hope. Take the time to learn what you're doing rather than just jumping to conclusions based on your ""feelings"" and you'll be a lot more successful. Just my opinion.",0.996

As areminder, we cut our fair value estimates on Verizon and AT&T on Dec. 23 as auction bidding reachednosebleed levels. Fortunately, activity cooled shortly thereafter. Actual results weren’t wildly differentthan our guesses, but carrier spending was higher than we’d hoped. Verizon spent $45.5 billion versusthe $37.5 billion we’d penciled in while AT&T shelled out $23.4 billion versus our $22.5 billion projectionwith the actual amounts likely to end up $4-8 billion higher after paying to relocate existing spectrumholders. We hadn’t expected T-Mobile to participate extensively, but it still ended up spending $9.3billion, more than double our estimate.However, the three carriers also ended up with more spectrum than we’d expected as Dish Networkwon virtually nothing and cable companies Comcast and Charter (bidding jointly) didn’t win anything.U.S. Cellular and private equity firm Grain Management each spent around $1 billion, but the big threestill ended up with more than 95% of the spectrum on offer. Holding more spectrum should reducecapital spending needs, all else equal, while keeping spectrum out of the hands of upstarts shouldcontribute to competitive rationality among the three firms. Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T plan to holdanalyst meetings on successive days March 10-12. The firms will undoubtedly extol their network We don’t expect to materially change our fair value estimates or economic moat ratings as a result ofthe C-band auction. We currently view AT&T ($36 fair value estimate) as the most attractive of the threewireless carriers. We believe Verizon is roughly fairly valued ($57) and T-Mobile is modestly overvalued($108). We’re happy to see Dish ($35) exercise restraint given the network buildout ahead of it, but therange of potential outcomes around this effort is large"".",0.999

In addition the company is carrying an enormous amount of debt from buying Warner Bros. With regard to Cell Phones, T-Mobile and Verizon are very strong competition. When it comes to streaming media, the competition is Netflix, Disney and many others. Warren Buffet talks about investing in companies that have a MOAT. Companies that do or own something that no one else has. Buffet would never buy AT&T. It is literally the opposite of what he looks for in a potential investment.

Reporting eliminates the offending post, and it notifies officials at yahoo of the contents of the post. Since muting someone has such a limited overall effect on the offender, I don’t recommend it because it’s comparable to witnessing a crime and responding by closing your eyes. Not very helpful. What I would recommend is to report the offender. Under the report abuse option, (the three dots to the right of you post), you have the option of being more specific with your objections. For example, you can choose to identify the offending post as an; Inappropriate post, Does not belong here post, Looks like spam post, Copyright violation post, or Something else. Under the “something else” heading, you get to put in your own words the nature of your complaint. If someone posts something truly offence, threatening or incendiary, then it’s best for everyone that you report the offending post and not just mute it. Lots of sick people out there.

Check page 44 of the 8-K that was filed with the SEC on Jan 30. It appears that Stephenson is already on his way to his planned debt reduction to the $150's by the end of 2019. If they do generate the expected $26 billion of free cash flow this year and they are able to sell some assets as planned, they could do it! At a minimum, assuming the $26 billion of free cash flow works out as planned, with $14 billion going to dividends, they would be able to reduce the debt by $12 more down to $164 billion from the current $176.Sounds like Stephenson is already on his way to fulfilling his promise!",0.957

Either some stocks are going to get hammered soon or the idea of an economic depression is overdone. I'm not saying T is in the best debt position at this point, but the dividend should be safe for 6 months unless this gets really bad in which case the Dow will be at 10,000 and portfolios will be crushed. There is no way Apple will sell even 300M Iphones if people aren't paying their cell phone bill. Yet I don't see that kind of reaction in those stocks. Most tech stocks, even consumer tech, is holding up better than the general market. But, people will be far more likely to pay a cell phone bill than to buy a new cell phone. So at this point, the sell-off in T is an over reaction in comparison to other stocks, but that doesn't guarantee anything. Maybe their sell-off is coming if the consumer suffers for longer than a few months. The question is more basic. Will governments continue down this path even in the face of massive unemployment? I thought the objective was curve flattening, not avoiding every case. So you would think in a few weeks that we would return to normal, whatever that normal is. At that point, it's on each person to decide their own risk tolerance. But I know Americans and we are risk-takers in general, so I doubt we suffer a depression and have bread lines. It will be more likely that anyone over 65 stays home and the rest of society carries on and some take more chances than others. So T will be fine and although a little bruised, will be paying the same dividend they always pay.",-0.7891

4655,"Morningstar finds 'T' attractive:Analyst Note Michael Hodel, CFA, Director, 27 Jan 2021""AT&T’s fourth-quarter financial results weren’t great, but the firm is making progress in several areas,notably postpaid wireless and HBO Max. As with Verizon yesterday, AT&T’s inability to discuss the Cband spectrum auction is frustrating. Management cryptically promised to provide revised debt leverage targets after the auction concludes. While we don’t harbor concerns about AT&T’s balance sheet at this point, this uncertainty is not welcome, given the attention investors have paid to the debt load. AT&T ended 2020 with about $10 billion in cash and also reportedly lined up more than $10 billion in available credit earlier this month. As of now, we are sticking with our estimate that AT&T will spend around $20 billion for additional spectrum. Our fair value estimate remains $36, and we believe the stock is attractive. Postpaid net phone customer additions at AT&T (800,000 versus 279,000 at Verizon and 824,000 at TMobile) were impressive for the second consecutive quarter, likely reflecting relatively aggressive phone promotions. Management again made the case for this activity, highlighting its desire to strengthen relationships with existing customers. The percentage of AT&T customers upgrading phones was the highest in three years, and we estimate the carrier has closed the gap with Verizon in terms of customers using newer devices. But this effort has come at a cost: Phone and commission expenses pulled wireless segment EBITDA down 6% year over year despite 0.5% services revenue growth. We expect AT&T will be able to dial back promotions as 2021 progresses, though it indicated it hopes to continue driving customer growth. At Warner, the firm ended 2020 with nearly 42 million U.S. HBO Max subscribers, up 3.5 million during the quarter. The premier of Wonder Woman 1984 clearly had the desired effect on customer interest.HBO and a strong ad market couldn’t offset weak studio results, however, with total WarnerMedia revenue down 10% year over year"".",0.9983

Here is why: The P/E ratio is 6.7 with a forward P/E ratio of 9.24. As of 3/25/18, the average P/E ratio for the S&P was 23.6. This to me represents deep, deep value. Also, the payout ratio is only 41.39%. This indicates a sustainable dividend. The average dividend yield on the S&P 500 as of 3/25/18 was 1.99%. T at $32.00 is 6.25%. If T is down 10% in one year from now, which I think is highly unlikely, you will only lose 3.75% on your investment because of the dividend.

Netflix knew they had to catch up to its impending competitors' deep content libraries, and they will continue to rely on original productions to maintain subscribers.The global pandemic was both a blessing and a curse for Netflix. The enterprise was forced to shut down all production in North America until it is deemed safe to launch again (very uncertain timeline). Netflix's pipeline of new content is drying up, and many subscribers have watched everything (worth watching) on the platform.Disney, NBCUniversal, and WarnerMedia have decades of original video content at their disposal and do not need to rely on new productions nearly as much as Netflix. These three media giants could sit on their enormous libraries for years and still keep viewers entertained.

5019,T is a great retirement portfolio stock IMHO. I owned some A T and T stock from around 1969 to the mid 1980's. I dont recall the stock appreciating much higher in price but like clockwork I got my dividend monies every quarter. When the dust settled my 15 year investment was fruitful. At age 66 at this juncture I am just looking for basically a portfolio of high dividend paying stocks where management makes paying dividends a high priority. The banks currently are giving me almost zero incentive in keeping monies there. I cant retire comfortably on a 4/10ths of one per cent CD or money market fund. As far as the bashing of CNN; I would assume CNN produces a significant operating income for T; every time I put on CNN I see a commercial within minutes. I recall when BP had that terrible oil spill everyone cried they would never buy BP gasoline again. How long did that last. IMHO HBO MAX will be the key driver for 2021.,0.9707

5049,"WHY BUY SENS NOW!From Healthcare providers who implant Dexcom, Abbott and Eversensedaily.""I have been reading these posts for about a year and think it might be helpful to weigh in. I am a Nurse Practitioner and a Diabetes Specialist. I have placed several of the 3 month Eversense sensors in the past and am a stock holder. I bought it a few years ago when I was being detailed on the technology knowing it would be a game changer. (I also bought in early to Dexcom and Tandem). Patients love this technology and were quite upset when the sales force was pulled due to Covid. It was really starting to catch on. Patients were asking for it and more insurers were covering it. The technology absolutely works and patients much appreciated the autonomy. Sensors are cumbersome and have to be changed about every 10 days. Some fail or dislodge. Eversense is a game changer. My only hesitation (and for my colleagues as well) was the 90 day insertion period. It is a surgical insertion and the site locations are limited. Many of us wanted to wait to push until a 180 day sensor was available in order to limit number of insertions per year and risk of scar tissue over time for longer term users. Insertion, however, is easy to do and was starting to be reimbursed.I do think that Eversense will end up with a pump partner for a closed loop system. IMO, Tandem makes the most user friendly pump and is paired with Dexcom. It is the best functioning set on the market. Medtronic led with the first closed loop system, but their pump is cumbersome and their sensors have always lacked accuracy issues. The new Omni pod is interesting. They have accuracy issues in the past, that they seem to be resolving with their new pump. They are the only tubeless pump and might be a good partner for the Eversense. So would the Tandem pump.Anyway, I agree with those who think that this stock is a long term hold and will substantially increase in the next few years. The product just works.",0.9936

Even so, with most U.S. theaters closed, the film generated a fraction of the $412.8 million in domestic ticket revenue that the first installment in the series brought in three years ago.That may not be so bad for AT&T Inc.’s Warner Bros., the studio behind the $200 million film. “Wonder Woman 1984” also debuted on HBO Max on Christmas Day, which helped to break usage records, according to the studio. Almost half of the platform’s retail subscribers watched the film on the day of its arrival and HBO Max saw total viewing hours on Friday more than triple in comparison to a typical day in the previous month.",0.9481

Isn't $15 billion for giving up only 49% ownership a fair price considering the bleeding of customers? T would still own 51%. meanwhile, T will fall behind in the 5g auctions because did not get the needed cash from selling DTV.

The company also does not plan to repurchase shares during this period. 2021 guidance, announced in January 2021, remains unchanged. Revenue growth - 1% range. EPS to be stable with 2020. Capital Investment - $21B, FCF = $26B.So basically no growth in 2021! Also, seems to me that if the FCF is going to remain at $26B, with a $14 Dividend and with $21B committed to additional Capital Investments, the current Cash balance is going to start to suffer. $14B = $21B is $9B more than the $26B FCF.

6149,"AT&T Inc.AT&T (T) is America's largest telecommunications company by market cap, with only Verizon (VZ) representing a competitor of similar size.T's current corporate structure stems from an intricate array of mergers since the old Bell System's 1984, but today's version of AT&T has increased its dividend for 33 consecutive years. Still, T's valuation has declined recently due to two factors.The first is rising U.S. interest rates. With a dividend yield above 6% and a very recession-resistant business model, income investors often use AT&T as a higher- yielding bond substitute. But as 10-year U.S. Treasury yields have climbed to around 3%, some investors have been selling AT&T stock in favor of lower-yielding (but safer) fixed-income instruments.Meanwhile, AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner faced a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit that T only recently won. However, the merger has now gone through, and we believe this should catalyze AT&T's share price to go higher in coming months.But for now, the stock remains relatively cheap. AT&T should deliver $3.45 of fiscal- 2018 earnings per share, which implies just a 9.4 price-to-earnings ratio.

So, my question is what is going to happen to Turner (and DirecTV) over that time frame? What will happen to the movie business? Are they still going to be giving away free movies with HBO Max? I don't know about other people, but I have HBO Max. Which means I have no intention of paying for movie tickets when I can watch it at home for no extra cost.Then we have to look at the competition. Both TMUS and VZ have superior spectrum positions and may be able to sell fixed broadband internet nationally while AT&T will be restricted to a small footprint if they stick with fiber. Someone is going to be on the wrong side of that equation. Either VZ and TMUS are wrong or AT&T is wrong. Both VZ and TMUS are predicting growth to come from adding fixed wireless broadband.

6249,"**** HERE IS WHAT HBO MAX MEANS IN NUMBERS FROM ARTICLE*** HBOMAX could add an additional 50 mil global subscribers within three years, which would drive significant growth in T’s earnings stream. I estimate that 50 mil additional subscribers paying $14.99 per month would add $0.76 to T’s EPS, and 24% above FY20 consensus estimated EPS of $3.18. Additionally, I believe that T will enjoy significant margin expansion as they move their content to HBOM, because T will gain the economics of their network and cable distributors as they are disintermediated, which I have not factored into my numbers. The $0.76 in additional EPS could be worth $19+ per T share, assuming this EPS stream gets a 25x P/E multiple, which may be conservation given the growth profile. Furthermore, I think the 50 mil add estimate could be conservative based on all the recent positive developments at HBOM. As reference, the HBO platform currently has around 57 mil global subscribers, although HBOM has only launch in the US thus far. As comparison, Disney+ and Netflix have global subscriptions of 86.8 mil and 195 mil. On December 10th, Disney+ reported subscriber additions of 13.1 mil subs since October 3rd, and estimated they would be at 230-260 mil subscribers by 2024, both numbers were significantly above expectations.

It also agreed to a firewall between the two. That agreement, which was intended to prevent a full integration of the companies if the government wins its appeal, expires Thursday, Bloomberg noted.Because the appeals court issues its opinions on Tuesday and Friday mornings, it would have to rule Tuesday on the Justice Department's appeal before AT&T can end the separation agreement and proceed with the integration, according to Bloomberg.",0.9965

But we expect to hit this year, and we may hit earlier this year, our 2.5, but we will hit that. We will see -- live up to the commitment, we're going to do the show-me on what we've said about that. So that's the first priority.But once you're there, then you have to go through the normal evaluation of cash cost of equity, cash cost of debt, what -- where is your stock price at, what's the value of it, where you think your value is, what's the best answer for your shareholders. And so we'll do that in normal course. We've done this before. We'll go through that same process. We will get down to the 2.5 range just like we told you. We're going to live up to that. But right now, there's a good opportunity for us to exceed that and even exceed that this year in the near term here.

I discovered this analyzing a much bigger investors records (close family member), that got preferred shares at $25 with a 5% div. if the stock price settles under $25.83 with massive dividend well over 5% then there is a big problem for issuers of $T in the corporate debt market. Att won’t cut dividend or reduce credit worthiness. It’s better to buy up shares and for MM to manipulate upward pressure.

Govt. stats say no inflation in sight as far as anyone can see, NEC director Larry Kudlow points this out in virtually every interview he's done over the past year. Experts like to quote the history of these inversions ""over the past 50 years"" and how they foreshadowed significant recessions. One problem: this only happened on just SIX occasions over the past 50 years -- ALL OF WHICH HAVE OCCURRED SINCE 1989. To me, this raises about the statistical accuracy when all your data points are skewed towards one end of the chart.Why has this been happening since 1989, why not during the recessions of the 60's & 70's? I can answer that in two words: ALAN GREENSPAN. He chaired the Federal Reserve from 1987 through 2006. He was followed by Ben Bernanke 2006 - 20014 (Remember ""helicopter"" Ben?). Both were notorious for manipulating interest rates and so-called ""quantitative easy"" [i.e., throwing money at banks].

T was a $30 twenty years ago and except for a few occasions like last year when the Elliot group bought a chunk of shares, T has been and still is a $30 stock. Why do you suppose that is? All the talk about if T had so and so's multiple or if T was Disney or Netflix, yada yada, T would be this or that, but it's NOT. T is T and the fact is that the market doesn't see T as a growth stock like it does the other companies on the list. T is a dividend stock and that's it. My guess is that it's going to be a $30 stock for as long as T stays in business. It may have a few gyrations here and there taking it up to the mid to high thirties but it will always come back down and settle around $30 because it's not a growth stock. Just my opinion.",0.9894

6753,"After a stock goes X dividend, the price of the stock will decline by the amount of the dividend. That's almost a given. What happens after that is a reflection of market conditions at that time. In the case of T, price usually goes further down, to the $28 level or so, before leveling off. Eventually, it will make a run to about 30-dollar area again before retreating once more. T is considered dead money to many investors, but that’s because they don’t know how to trade the stock. If you are here to make a quick buck, then sticking around for the dividend was the wrong more. The right move would have been to buy into T several weeks before the X dividend date, take advantage of the ride up, and sold before that date. If you bought in for the dividend, then wait for the price to go back up to your entry point before selling. You might have to wait a bit and watch your investment decline to uncomfortable levels, but T’s price will eventually go back up as long as you got in under $30. Depending on market conditions, wait a week or two and you should be able to recover your investment along with the dividend. It’s not a guarantee, but so far it has worked for me. Also, T is in a long-term decline. Unless things turn around, try to get into T below $30 for the next dividend payment.",0.9885

7129,"Latest from Morningstar: 'T wants customers' :""AT&T Wants Customers: Analyst Day Highlights Focus onStability; Shares AttractiveAnalyst Note Michael Hodel, CFA, Director, 12 Mar 2021AT&T wrapped up the U.S. wireless carrier proceedings, holding its analyst day following Verizon and TMobile earlier in the week. Unlike its peers, AT&T declined to provide concrete longer-term financialforecasts. The firm instead outlined its expectations in broad strokes, with one exception: debt leverage.AT&T put stability and growth at the center of its messaging to investors, emphasizing the investmentsit is making in 5G, fiber, and HBO Max as foundations for the business. We continue to like the movesnew CEO John Stankey has made thus far. We don’t plan to change our $36 fair value estimate, and webelieve the shares are attractive.Management expects to end the year with net debt at 3.0 times EBITDA, up from 2.7 at the end of 2020and with net leverage declining to 2.5 times EBITDA or lower in 2024. While AT&T does have a higherdividend payout ratio than Verizon or T-Mobile, all three firms now have similar leverage metrics and areat least hinting at large shareholder returns in the coming years. AT&T also has the most diversebusiness mix of the three. We continue to view AT&T’s balance sheet as a strategic limitation (it wouldbe nice to repurchase shares at the current dividend yield) but not a significant threat to its viability.Stankey took the opportunity to address differences between his approach and that of his predecessor.He directly conceded that AT&T has been underinvesting in important areas, including efforts to retainand attract wireless customers. Stankey views establishing and growing customer relationships as the top priority for 2021, which will require investment in networks and content along with additionalmarketing efforts. Both Verizon and T-Mobile used their analyst days to strongly hint that wirelesspricing won’t change much over the next couple of years. While we’re disappointed that the industryisn’t showing pricing power, we’re at least hopeful that AT&T’s drive for customer growth won’t ignite aprice war"".",0.9933

It's like management has actively decided to be the worst or just next to it in every industry they get us in.

And, if they have money on the sidelines, they are not putting new money to work in T at the moment.

Read below:A classic Dividend AristocratAT&T is a Dividend Aristocrat, a member of the S&P 500 that has hiked its dividend annually for over 25 years. AT&T (known as Southwestern Bell/SBC Corporation before 2005) raised its dividend annually for 33 straight years.AT&T expects its adjusted EPS to hit the ""upper end of the $3.50 range"" this year, which would represent at least 15% growth from the previous year. The company currently pays a $0.50 quarterly dividend, which equals $2.00 per share for the full year -- which should be easily covered by its earnings.AT&T noted that its free cash flow (FCF) rose 17% annually to $6.5 billion during the quarter, and it expects to finish the year with FCF ""at the high end of the $21 billion range."" That should give AT&T, which spent $12 billion on dividend payments in fiscal 2017, plenty of room to raise its dividend and pay off its long-term debt.",0.9606

Then to the loyalty department and was finally to they could give me the $40 monthly but would have to downgrade me to 6mbps. That was that.

Synopsis follows:ARGUS RATING: BUY• Reaffirming BUY and $38 target• As expected, the pandemic weighed heavily on AT&T's 4Q results, especially in the WarnerMedia andVideo divisions.• However, the core wireless services business continued to show resilience as work-at-homerestrictions have made communication services and connectivity more vital than ever.• The 4Q20 launch of the iPhone 12 may spur increased competition in the wireless industry, thoughconsumers may still be reluctant to switch carriers due to the pandemic.• We are lowering our 2021 EPS estimate to $3.19 from $3.27 and setting a 2022 forecast of $3.25.INVESTMENT THESIS We are maintaining our BUY rating on AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) to a target price of $38. The COVID-19 pandemic had multiple negative impacts on AT&T's business in 4Q20,especially on the WarnerMedia and Entertainment divisions. However, the core wirelessservices business continued to show resilience as the pandemic and follow-onwork-at-home restrictions have made communication services and connectivity more vitalthan ever. Based on management's comments, we expect AT&T to face continued revenue andprofit pressure from the pandemic in 2021. While these effects may tail off over time, thefuture is highly uncertain - as reflected in management's weak 2021 guidance. Still, AT&Tcan rely on its strong balance sheet and prudent management as strengths in the currentenvironment. The 4Q20 launch of the iPhone 12 may spur increased competition in thewireless industry, and AT&T has offered an attractive promotion to boost iPhone 12upgrades. Nevertheless, consumers may be reluctant to switch carriers until the pandemicrecedes. AT&T trades at a modest forward valuation premium to peers and at the low end ofthe historical range.",0.9727

The firm delivered solid wireless results during the second quarter, while Game of Thrones provided a lift at WarnerMedia’s HBO unit, which has struggled to grow amid a carriage dispute with Dish Network. The troubled entertainment segment again outperformed our expectations, balancing pricing and expenses better than we thought possible, contributing to profit growth. Consolidated cash flow was also again strong, enabling another quarter of significant debt reduction. Management increased its 2019 free cash flow projection to $28 billion from $26 billion. This increase was based primarily on the sale of WarnerMedia receivables, rather than any major change in the business, which appears to reflect management’s desire to begin repurchasing shares as soon as possible. We agree that repurchases would add value for shareholders given the current stock price"".",0.9922

They IPO'ed Chipolte and held all the millions of shares as it skyrocketed once detached from the hated parent company. T has too many haters, but HBO is a well liked brand with a history of some of the best shows ever made by a non-broadcast network. They can keep the partnerships and free HBO for Cell subscribers and even better - pay a fee for them. T revenue doesn't go anywhere, but HBO revenue grows like crazy.

Speaking to CNBC, Stephenson reiterates AT&T should generate $26B in free cash flow this year, leaving $12B for debt reduction after the company shells out $14B in dividends. He says there's another $6B-$8B in the pipeline from asset sales. Add that to the $9B it repaid last year, and AT&T will have repaid 75% of the Time Warner debt by the end of 2019, Stephenson tells CNBC.

8353,"7 Reasons AT&T is undervalued and poised to outperform... 1) T offers a high dividend yield backed by a growing stream of free cash flows.2) T is aggressively paying-down debt which decreases its risk profile every year.3) T has begun an aggressive share repurchase program which will take advantage of the low price to earnings multiple in the stock price.4) T expects adjusted EPS to hit $4.65 by 2022 at the midpoint.5) T expects to pay off 100% of the debt issued for the Time Warner acquisition and end with debt to EBITDA of 2.0 to 2.25 times by 2022.6) T expects $31 billion in free cash flow at the midpoint by 2022.7) T has guided to use between 50% and 70% of free cash flow after the dividend for retiring shares (over 3% annually) and expects to retire 70% of shares issued for the Time Warner acquisition by 2022 (about 750 million shares).Assuming T hits their target of $4.65 in 2022 EPS, shares appear too cheap. Even if assuming no multiple expansion, then they arrive at a share price of $49 in 2022, or approximately 15% total annual returns over the next three years. Assuming T sees multiple expansion to 12 times earnings, shares would trade at $56, or approximately 18% total annual returns.Source: Seeking Alpha",0.986
