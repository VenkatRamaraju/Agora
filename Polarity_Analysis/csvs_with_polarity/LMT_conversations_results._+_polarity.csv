54,"The pension transfer to Prudential is not good for retirees as they lose ERISA and PBGC protection. If Prudential fails, the only protection is from their state’s program and there is a lifetime cap on the resultant benefit whereas for PBGC it pays until death. This pension risk transfer benefits LMT and Prudential, but is a take away from the retirees and current employees pending retirement. Not fair to employees and there needs to be new regulations. At a minimum, reitirees should be given the option, and LMT should be required to purchased a third party insurance policy to replace the protection that was provided by PBGC. Continued erosion of overall employee benefits (this being just one element of change) is hurting the aerospace industry and is impacting current employee morale. Attrition rates have increased in the aerospace sector and with that, the loss of critical tacit knowledge. This knowledge loss is impacting program performance which is manifested in technical problems, schedule delays and cost overruns. Years ago, the aerospace sector was viewed as having the best benefits, and great technology and as such attracted top talent. Today, it is easy to find other companies with better benefits packages and higher technology and as such the top engineering talent is going elsewhere. It is also evident as the top management is driven by financial performance as opposed to what historically made the industry - the next great engineering design. Investors should look much deeper.",0.9976

The algorithm effectively puts all the elements into a hat; it continually determines the next element by randomly drawing an element from the hat until no elements remain. The algorithm produces an unbiasedpermutation: every permutation is equally likely. The modern version of the algorithm is efficient: it takes time proportional to the number of items being shuffled and shuffles them in place CAPM 降低風險，增加回收率。找會做Baccarat App 的研究生,開發應用軟件。P3+P1+P2 +9% ; Then Banker.If < -9%; Then Player.Probability is the key.Worldwide Master Coach 全球總教練謙卑的心態。Holy Spirit.人生苦短，一季玩一次百家樂，邊賺錢邊遊憩，其樂無窮！好友：楊永樂、蒒維誠、馬英九、盧克修、李蔚華、林子安、汪大衛的故事。恩師：馬鶴淩、張宗良、史正鼎、李金嬋、Chris Chang/Morris Chang、林老弟兄、吳鶴予將軍、徐半仙的往事。活到老學到老的禪修靜音。Lesson and learned.天行建，君子以自強不息日新月異的時代！忘記背後努力面前，向著標竿直跑，為著得到主耶穌的獎賞。耶和華是我的牧者，我實在一無所缺！Amen.敢於挑戰極限的勇氣！發揮人性潛能最大的力量。死而無憾！三財百家樂高級班2017畢業生：Mr. Le in Boston.Ms. Liang in New York.不要忘了買進PME & MDSO.EB5 project is the key to get green card.

Subtract $13.64 from Leidos because that's the special dividend to be paid before the merger closes. $251.90 / ($50.59-$13.64) = 6.8173, the number of new Leidos shares that 1 share of LMT was worth. Add the 10% sweetener, you'd get 1.11 x 6.8173 = 7.5672 shares of Leidos. Free money!Of course arbitragers will buy LMT to tender it for the 11% gain (10% discount). But need to be careful because of that 8.2136 share upper limit. Today's closing numbers were LMT $262.54 and Leidos $48.74 (minus $13.64 = $35.10).$262.54 / $35.10 = 7.4798, times 1.11 = 8.3026, which exceeds that upper limit. They'd still get a 9.8% advantage looking at today's prices. (8.2136 / 7.4798 = 1.098)That probably explains the recent very high volume numbers for both companies. Today's trades settle on August 16th (T+3), which is the offer expiration date. No clue how prices will move before then, or immediately afterwards. That's the risk. Tomorrow morning should bring more news on the final numbers.

964,"Bloomberg Business ranked Boeing’s Voluntary Investment Plan (VIP) second among large companies’ 401(k) plans in its new 401(k) rankings.According to Bloomberg, “401(k) plans have replaced pensions as the way most companies help employees save for retirement. Workers make before-tax contributions and pile up tax-deferred cash, and employers often match part of what they put in. But some plans are more generous than others.”Boeing provides a 75 percent match on the first 8 percent of base pay that most nonunion employees save in their VIP accounts. Only five companies on the list offer a higher matching contribution. New hires are automatically enrolled in the VIP at 4 percent of base pay. Unless they make a change or opt out, this rate automatically increases by 1 percent each April until they are saving 8 percent of base pay and receiving the full Boeing match.Bloomberg’s scoring was based on matching contributions, additional company contributions, investment features, vesting and automatic enrollment. The maximum potential match represented half of the score.The study looked at the 50 largest companies in the S&P 500 and used 2013 data, the most recent information publicly available.

The shareholders wouldn't have approved the buyout if they thought it wasn't going to get approved. This will cut through the red tape easily. The time to be a bear on this name has passed. The economy is reopening. That should aid the aerospace and defense companies greatly. LMT is dirt cheap at these levels...those who say it will never go up again don't understand the business. This is a great company and with a great CEO and it will be rewarded for that over the long term. Those who say it is a value trap don't understand where the stock used to trade and the implications of a fully functioning economy. They also don't understand that when interest rates are going up and inflation happens that value stocks like LMT are the places you want to be.

According to CNNMoney, this practice is considered wage theft and it supposedly occurred at Chipotle locations throughout the United States.Chipotle denies the allegation, saying the case has no merit and that the chain pays its employees all owed wages.The lawsuit, known as Turner v. Chipotle, states that ""Chipotle routinely requires hourly restaurant employees to punch out, and then continue working until they are given permission to leave.""The lawsuit is named after a former Chipotle manager ""who claims she had to work without pay and was told to make workers under her do the same in order to meet budget goals,"" according to CNNMoney.The chain has been hit with similar lawsuits in the past, but this one is noteworthy because of the high number of plaintiffs.

This steep discount is being driven by fear of Defense spending cuts under new Democratic governance, in our view.

1832,"ALL BOW TO RISING CHINA.As America’s grasp on the world of supercomputing continues to slip, the Department of Energy is seeking to reinvigorate the nation’s capabilities.A new ranking shows that for the second year running, the world’s fastest supercomputer is TaihuLight, housed at the National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi, China. Capable of performing 93 quadrillion calculations per second, it’s almost three times faster than the second-place Tianhe-2. And in third spot this year is a newly upgraded device, called Piz Dain, at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, which recently had its performance boosted by the addition of Nvidia GPUs.Sadly for America, the upgraded Piz Dain pushes the Department of Energy’s Titan supercomputer, which is housed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, into fourth spot. Able to make 17.6 quadrillion number crunches per second, Titan is just a fifth as fast as TaihuLight. In its defense, the U.S. still claims five of the top 10 spots, and it is home to 169 of the supercomputers that make up the fastest 500. China, meanwhile, can only claim 160.But the news nonetheless serves to highlight America's decline as a supercomputing heavyweight. This is the first time since 1996 that America hasn’t held one of the top three spots. It indicates that, while it certainly has significant supercomputing resources, it can’t tackle its biggest problems at anywhere near the speeds enjoyed by researchers in China.It may be tempting to suggest that the dawn of practical quantum computing, one of our 10 breakthrough technologies of 2017, would remove the need for supercomputers. But it will be several years before quantum computers can perform such large-scale calculations. Even then, while quantum devices promise to be able to solve some specific problems with incredible speed, it’s not clear whether they will be able to reliably solve all problems faster than regular supercomputers.That leaves many areas of research currently reliant on the results of huge computational effort—among them drug discovery, materials science, and climate modeling—still in need of fast supercomputers.The Department of Energy, whose Titan device was once the fastest in the world, is painfully aware of that fact. That’s exactly why it last week announced a $258 million funding injection into its exascale computing project. The money, which will be shared between AMD, IBM, Intel, Nvidia, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Cray, is intended to fuel development of machines that are 50 times faster than Titan.The U.S. government reckons it will have a system capable of performing one quintillion operations per second—that’s 1,000 quadrillion, and 10 times the capacity of TaihuLight—by 2021. But China’s fierce investment into supercomputing has led it to claim that it may achieve the same feat by as soon as 2020. Speed, it seems, is of the essence for America.(Read more: Top 500, Wall Street Journal, “The New Fastest Supercomputer Is Chinese Through and Through,” “10 Breakthrough Technologies: Practical Quantum Computers”)Become an MIT Technology Review Insider for in-depth analysis and unparalleled perspective.Subscribe today",0.9981

2479,"Some reasons I invested in Lockheed Martin today:- This is a stock that will grow dividends for years as they've done at the past (40% payout ratio)- The return on equity of this company is phenomenal- The outlook of the stock looks better after q2 earnings, they predict even better earnings than before for the year- Public spending post coronovirus will increase. There are many reason for this. US government has to do it with Boeing in order to keep them on business and Lockheed will take a huge advantage of this. - The more China grows the more the N.A.T.O will spend (read Ray Dalio's analysis on that and you'll find out some elements), as such Lockheed will take advantage of new orders that will come. Defense is a space where USA has a competitive advantage against China and will drive it for the next decade- The company is very well diversified and positioned for a space boom that might come this and the following decades- My conservative discounted cash flow for this stock shows that the fair value of the stock is 433$ with a beta of 1. However, I believe that the stock has a realistic beta of way below 1 (check Zack's historic beta) when market conditions are not that volatile which make the fair value of the stock a lot higher.

These are good bets for your retirement accounts if you have 5 - 10 years to wait until you need to draw on the proceeds. This world is not a better place than a year ago. Russia is a constant threat; Iran is in the mix; China, above all, is the biggest threat because their military technology (some might have been stolen from the US) is quickly catching up to ours. I don't care who's in the White House or which party controls our government, it'd be foolish not to continue to invest in and upgrade our military. With the backlogs these guys have, I would not worry too much holding shares. Remember, the only stocks that performed well and appreciated during the great depression were defense stocks.

It owns 50% of ULA, which has more than 130 successful missions under its belt. The company recently agreed to purchase rocket-parts maker Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings ( AJRD Loading...Loading...) for about $4.4 billion. Lockheed can make satellites, too, and is an investor in Rocket Lab. It may be one of the largest, most complete space franchises.Investors might think of Lockheed as ""old space,"" with only the government as a customer. But the convergence of government and commercial is happening, meaning that Lockheed will have the same opportunities as some of the hottest start-ups.That doesn't mean the stock will trade like a space stock. ""The Aerojet deal was nice,"" says Dan Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus. ""But Lockheed is still a defense franchise.""Defense stocks haven't gotten much love of late. Investors have been nervous about budget deficits and Democratic control of the executive and legislative branches, which could mean less military spending. Lockheed shares have dropped about 9% over the past six months, even as the S&P 500 has gained 18%.That fear may be overstated. ""Since World War II, there has been no relationship between military spending and [ budgetary] economics,"" Aboulafia tells Barron's. ""Defense is driven by threat and politics, that's all.""Morgan owns shares. He believes he's buying a great business at a low price. Lockheed shares trade for just 13.6 times estimated 2021 earnings of $26.34 a share, a big discount to the market's 22.6 times multiple. If the stock can trade at a price/earnings ratio of 20, roughly in line with its recent discount to the S&P 500 valuation multiple, shares would fetch about $500, up more than 40% from recent levels. Lockheed has an attractive dividend yield, too, at about 3%. ""I'm getting paid to wait,"" adds Morgan. He's expecting good things.",0.9849

While those who gave up their LMT stock might have come out okay, those of us who stayed loyal are presently down about $23 per share. (Don't tell me it's just temporary, because no one knows that for sure.) Meanwhile, I'd like to put in my two cents worth about what the company should do with that $1.8 B one-time special payment. The company has stated that it could be used for share buybacks, paying down debt, and/or dividends. While share buybacks might help the stats (and the CEO's bonus), it doesn't do squat for me except in the most theoretical sense. Paying down debt does't make much sense right now because debt is so cheap. Therefore, I'd like to see -- and think we deserve -- a special dividend to be divided among the shareholders at the time of execution of the deal. That would come to about $5,75 a share. Sure, I would have to pay taxes on that money, but that's a lot better than feeling like I got hosed.",0.9805

There is a prime driver for this and some lesser contributing factors. The good news is that, absent a major market meltdown, the stock should have put in a short term bottom in the 345-348 area. The Covid pandemic is the primary driver. There are hundreds if not thousand's of suppliers that that provide parts for the F35 fighter. For most of the year, analysts were expecting 141 delivered F35s but due to the pandemic, LM will only deliver 123. Wall Street had probably baked in a higher number notwithstanding the pandemic. The good news is that most of the bad news is in the stock and it should resume its upward movement since it put in the intermediate term low last week. I think once analysists believe the worst is over WRT to production, it should be moving again.
