CI expects its 2019 adjusted revenues to be $131.5-133.5bln. CI’s 2019 EPS outlook of $16.00-$16.50 bracketed our EPS estimate of$16.45. While the guidance was slightly below cons of $16.53, it did notinclude prior year development and was in-line with broader investorexpectations. In-line with its historical practice, Cigna’s 2019 outlook not onlyexcludes PYD but also any future capital deployment.

The companies most exposed to those provisions would be MOH (47% of EPS) and CNC at (40%). WCG (8%) and ANTM (6%) also have exposure. Finally, CVS’s Aetna subsidiary, CI, and UNH have limited exposure to the repeal of the ACA, with less than 2% of their earnings derived from ACA-related enrollment. Of note, these numbers are gross exposures, as there would be some offset from the repeal of the Health Insurer Fee (HIF)- 2% on average for diversified names. In fact, after factoring in the offset from the HIF, in our view diversified names would largely have a minimal impact and HUM may actually benefit from a repeal of the ACA given it has minimal ACA revenue and would benefit from a repeal of the HIF.

After 2 years of LTD coverage by Cigna for brain trauma from a vehicle accident, my claim was denied in December 2019. My claim has documents from top neurologists, Neuro Ophthalmologists, A Cigna ordered IME in 2019 that fully supported my claim. SSA assessment fully supporting my claim. A brain MRI measuring the damage. A claim manager systematically removed all medical documents through multiple fraudulent activities. Then stated that Cigna didn't understand my condition so I am denied. (can't make this stuff up) I sent a letter to the ethics team and to the CEO. I received a response that they would investigate and get back to me by Feb. 10th. Didn't happen. I have been working on the appeal and have worked through 1200 pages of documents. What I found: Dr. Teitel found no impairments of cognition, sight, hearing. This Cigna Doctor had a Neuro Ophthalmology report showing visual processing damage from the Mayo Clinic in his hands. The date of the document: December 2019. My case is valued at approximately $1.5 million if I don't recover. The denial: December 2019. The assessed value for the transaction with New York Life: December 2019. The implications could be huge. I am just one claimant. How many other high value claims were denied using various methods that are at best, not aligned with Insurance Law and the Regulatory Settlement? The way my file was handled makes Jeffrey Skilling look like a good honest businessman. I cannot say if there is debt hidden for the upcoming transaction, I will say that statistically, if I am the only claimant of high value that was denied using an evaluation by a clerk of my medical records, it would be an anomaly that will rank in the top 10 all time. I know most here are looking to buy or sell Cigna stock and hopefully watch the stock price climb. I wish you the best. I use United Health Care for all other medical. They operate with integrity, have never attempted to fraudulently deny a procedure, and never overcharge. UHC crushes Cigna in revenue, profit and flow through. Cigna is no threat to them. My projection is that Cigna will collapse without leaders who value integrity. A solid audit of Cigna's projections, debt, processes, etc has the possibility of bringing the company to its knees at any time. My stock purchase money would go to United Health Care. Without question, better leaders, better support team, better training. They have the power to eliminate Cigna or buy them for 1 times revenues after Cigna leadership destroys value. like New York Life just did with the LTD group. One final note: In the last two months Cigna has made the World News for fraudulent or questionable decisions. Making the world news once in a 10 year run for this type of activity is bad. Two stories in two weeks regarding Cigna should be enough to scare any investor away. If there are other LTD claimants out there with similar stories, please share with potential investors.",0.9995

311,"A quick sanity check on the “Medicare for All” overhang and why it’s overdone Industry Overview Equity | 01 March 2019 10 reasons why MFA has little chance of passing On Tuesday, Congress released a “Medicare for All” proposal that would completely replace the current managed care model by moving everyone to the traditional Medicare program. Although this has hurt multiples for the managed care sector, we essentially see this as an issue of headline risk with very little chance of implementation. We do expect Democrats to work towards coverage expansion, but a more likely scenario is shoring up the ACA (a clear positive for healthcare). Although we have been highlighting headline risk as the biggest risk for Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) this year, in our view valuations are overly discounting a very low likelihood event (CI is trading at 8.5x 2021 guide). Below we highlight 10 points on the “Medicare for All” (MFA) bill and why we see little chance of the bill being passed in the next 5 years. 1. There are 107 co-sponsors of this bill, underscoring the importance of the issue. However, this is below the 124 people who co-sponsored a similar bill last year. 2. There are few details on how this would work and no details on how it will be funded. Cost has sunk every such provision in the past and we think is likely the biggest roadblock this time. 3. The current Medicare program is expected to go bankrupt in 7 years. This program would cover more things than Medicare – vision, dental, hearing, LT care, have no premiums, copays or deductible and all providers will be in-network. 4. We estimate paying hospitals Medicare rates would bankrupt the industry. The Center for American Progress estimates that hospitals need to be paid 20% more than the Medicare rate and doctors need to be paid 10% more to make those businesses viable – which would make it even more difficult to finance. 5. Few (if any) industries are likely to support this proposal – beyond eliminating MCOs, it would eliminate all for-profit HC providers (hospitals, nursing homes, etc) and Medicare would negotiate drug pricing. We expect significant lobbying against this bill. 6. Simplistic view is that Dems say we don’t need managed care. Factual evidence indicates the government can’t manage utilization and MCOs must play a role. 7. Medicaid MCOs manage 51% of Medicaid spending (vs 26% 10 yrs ago) and save states 10-15% and improve quality. Dem and Republican states have moved to MCOs. 8. Medicare Advantage (MA) covers 35% of seniors (up from 25% 10 yrs ago despite rate cuts) as it is able to provide better benefits than Medicare for the same price. 9. The stars have to align. We think Dems would need to win the Presidency and the Senate (likely a large majority) to pass the bill. The President would need to make “Medicare for All” the key initiative for the agenda. 10. But even that is no guarantee - Trump failed to repeal the ACA despite controlling the House (large majority) and the Senate (52 seats). Obama almost failed to pass the Affordable Care Act (ACA) (a much less aggressive plan) despite controlling the House (large majority) and the Senate (60 seats). What gets the group working? Beats and raises We forecast average annual EPS growth of 14% across the large cap MCOs over the next 3 years, and we see upside for all of them. We expect strong Q1 beats and raises, positive tone at Investor Days and regulatory clarity in May on the rebate rule (likely including a delayed implementation) which should help multiples.

312,"Has any of these talking heads and bloggers really looked at the deal with ExpressScripts? It's not that bad, I think folks are concentrating on the debt - which is actually ""book debt"" and is not owed real money (yet). I think folks have forgotten that Trump had a meeting with these guys last spring. ""Nothing"" came out of that meeting, but shortly thereafter you began to see a flurry of M&A deals, and companies repositioning under a new model. Don't kid yourself folks - last year they got a glimpse of what is coming, and they are all switching to the new model. I suspect that Gaul was divided into three parts, and Cigna is grabbing the third piece. And it will probably be good. Cigna is certainly a bit later to the party, but not the last one. Once the new health care stuff is revealed by the administration, folks will see how smart a move this was - not only for Cigna, but UHC, Amazon, etc.",0.9816

That puts Cigna at $280-$290 . My revised target price is $300-$320 . Cigna has more ground to cover than the other two I watch as it’s stock price has been depressed . Could Cigna do a stock split ? A thought . The last one was in 2007 . But splits aren’t as popular now with BOD’s . I do think it would help the stock price if one were declared - but let’s not hold our breath waiting for it .Given the above ....

Express loses 30% of its business in 2020 from ANTM yet this fool is paying a 36% premium for it and assumes 15B in debt! He claims immediate accretion at a time when PBM's are being assailed for their pricing practices and are being targeted by state attorney generals. Faber hit it on the head, telling Cordani the market doesn't agree with his thesis that the combined company will be accretive as the stock at the time was down 6% which is now 10%. Cordani response, I don't care about the stock price I know it will be accretive. In other words screw the shareholders I'm the king. His assertion that in 18 - 24 months the company will have eliminated most of the debt is at best absurd. We'll see what Moody has to say when the process their review of the company debt and their subsequent rating which will impact borrowing costs.

Continued growth in this sector is vertical integration, everyone sees that - that's why all the players have moved, or are moving, to that model.

It’s been what I have been touting as the benefit from buying Express Scripts:When you have ONE view of the COMPLETE patient; rx’s filled or sometimes more importantly, maintenance meds for high blood pressure etc late to be refilled, or not filled at all, and the complete medical history of the patient, there is no one else better to assess the current condition of the patient. Traditional pharmacies only see pharmacy claims. Doctors only see what THEY ALONE prescribed. CIGNA’s integrated care model brings all this data under one roof, in one place, where sophisticated algorithms and teams of pharmacists and nurses identify patients most likely to have an adverse medical event. These patients or their prescribers are contacted to try and avoid that ‘upcoming adverse event’. Avoiding the cost of even one visit to the ER or even a fall leading to an ER visit with a hip fracture and orthopedic surgery and a protracted recovery in a rehab center is incredible is directly measurable in dollars saved. Take for example, the patient above who falls, goes to ER, hip replacement, extended stay in rehab center (think Covid now)—-> how do you measure the psychological toll this takes on the patient and their families ?This happening to a grandparent can directly impact easily 100 members of their families with worry, days taken off from work, transportation, etc. The psychological costs can never be measured.

856,"CI has new high every day, but it's PE is still around 11, that means CI is still undervalued among its peers. When HUM reports earnings tomorrow, beat the estimates, it should take the whole sector go higher. CI should in the 190s by Dec.",0.8552

I see at the most $5 by Friday, but would not be surprised to see it stay at $164.xx to close out Friday's puts under $165. Otherwise, it will be near $169 by Friday. Hopefully, it is not $159.

877,Where is the benefit to the shareholders,0.4296
878,$169 is a steal. Avg analyst is saying $210. At $175 there is still 20% upside remaining. Buy on dips and buy all the way up to at least $175. Cramer said buy buy when it was around $175 also(even though he is not always correct) but this time we do have a good buy. It will spring back up fast when shorts start covering today.,0.9448
