116,"If you have spent anytime around children in the past year while they are on a device, you know about Roblox. And if you're a parent, you also know about Robux (Roblox currency) as your credit card may have gotten charged by purchases made in-game. All I could think about was 'revenue' and when is the IPO.Developers have been looking for a new platform to take their talents further and also have greater freedom while reaching an entire new and broader age group of gamers.Enter RBLX.Roblox reminds me of Fortnite and Minecraft in popularity & style.I believe Roblox will be even more successful than Fortnite & Minecraft though.Roblox is more than gaming, and similar to Fortnite, will take entertainment and social media to a new level that many can't grasp...especially if you're over the age of 40.Roblox is capturing majority of the 6 to 18 year olds, and in the next 5-10 years will continue holding onto these users. Similar to how Facebook users from 2007 were still using FB in 2017...and still to today.That's 10 years of more interaction and huge revenue potential.I also like the fact Roblox has been quite safe for kids as they have been very proactive from my research.And these kids spend at least 2 hours a day on Roblox.For me, RBLX is comparable to $FB, $TWTR, along with $EA. Combine these 3 companies, and I see $RBLX.I'm in at $64.50 and will hold this one for 10 years. Keep buying. Keep holding.I expect RBLX to be at $140+ within 6 months.",0.9943

I would expect it might go back to the $40's...Honestly, I'm a conservative, and while I don't feel like Twitter is near equal in terms of the left and the right, I don't understand this selloff. I watched a fair bit of the meeting in Washington, and I thought Jack did pretty well. Certainly did better than Google or Facebook. I think he genuinely wants a platform that is balanced but seems to be struggling with knowing how to get there. In any case, I think this sell off is over done, and I think the technical set up (morning star) is an indicator that many other members of the market think so too. Not sure it turns a full on reversal and bull trend... it may just have a solid bounce day that eventually leads to further movement down. But I feel pretty that twitter isn't going to shrink below this support level without some kind of good fight to hold onto it. Again, I think the technicals (morning star potential set up) is indicative of this fight back that is brewing, which is why I think we get a solid bounce on Monday. What happens beyond that... I'm not sure. I can only say that it would fulfill the morning star candlestick pattern which is a bullish reversal signal indicating it should continue to go up ...IF Monday comes through with the completion of that morning star candlestick pattern.

Getting emotional about it and bashing Twitter isn't going to help. Twitter doesn't show the characteristics of a bubble for the following reasons: 1) It's still one of the least hyped-up stocks this year. Its movement hasn't been straight up parabolic like many other stocks. 2) Its revenue has actually been going up along with many other important metrics (like monetizable users). 3) Guidance for Q4 is low because it's trying to grow headcount and invest in itself. Companies can't be making money all the time. They have to think about the future. You all seem to have forgotten that Amazon took almost 10 YEARS to turn a profit. 4) Even if Twitter's rise doesn't make sense, the bears must realize that the euphoria can still screw them over until they're bankrupt. As a reference, the Tesla shorts got completely wrecked ($2.5 BILLION in ONE day). And Tesla's rise has definitely been euphoric. Doubling down on short positions can cause a massive squeeze, making people double down more, causing a more massive squeeze. Yes, the bears could be right, but they would still lose money in that case. So, think over your positions carefully. Be logical about it instead of emotional.",0.8819

So Twitter use was up big because of the elections... people were involved and using Twitter for their info and news source, that ran the stock price up, I get it. When twitter reported the increase in users, everyone assumed that increase would be permanent.... Then they banned President Trump.... then they started kicking off (permanent suspensions) a ton of conservatives! Twitter got super boring with those big name conservatives gone... I've noticed it myself... I mean BORING. Conservatives are jumping ship in big numbers to GAB. When Twitter went all out with there bans and censoring, everyone started jumping to Parler, but then amazon who hosted Parlers servers shut them down. Everyone jumped to GAB. Gab is a GREAT platform that does not censor. People are finding all their old twitter favorites on GAB now. Conservatives love GAB & don't really care to go back to Parler & will never go back to Twitter. Twitter shot itself in the foot by banning and censoring 50% of it's users. What were they thinking?? And they are still banning on a daily basis. Everyone knows one day they will wake up and find themselves kicked off of twitter so they are establishing their Gab accounts. Honestly, GAB is a better looking more user friendly site than twitter and they don't limit the characters/ words you can use in a post. I know this post jumps around but I'm on my way out the door so don't have time to proof read. In short, Twitter is going to go down because President Trump and other big names have been kicked off, the elections are over so people are spending their time elsewhere, conservatives are jumping to GAB in great numbers because all their favorites are there, because they know their twitter days are numbered before they get banned... and many are also leaving in protest to Twitter.

The whistleblower said he was present at multiple meetings.The Epoch Times was not able to independently verify the claims.“I was witness to the creation and operation of a sophisticated electronic voting system that permitted the leaders of the Venezuelan government to manipulate the tabulation of votes for national and local elections and select the winner of those elections in order to gain and maintain their power,” the affidavit states.“From that point on, Chavez never lost any election. In fact, he was able to ensure wins for himself, his party, Congress persons and mayors from townships.”The whistleblower claimed the “software and fundamental design of the electronic electoral system and software of Dominion and other election tabulating companies relies upon software that is a descendant of the Smartmatic Electoral Management System.”",0.9923

I was met with ambivalence and antipathy (A&A).Then I tried to use it to show my support for teachers unions over the education of students. Again, I got mostly A&A. Worried the card was defective, and not to be deterred, I made a third attempt by flashing the card as I went for the first time to a BLM rally. Again, A&A.So here I sit with a card that just doesn't seem to work but I am unsure.

Once the pps breaks through the $37 dollar level, from technical charting, there's little resistance to $50, really nothing holding it back. That's my take, but each of you longs should take a listen for yourselves. Additionally, those CNBC Fast Money guys were reiterating on Friday that there is a very large amount of calls compared to small amount of puts open interest. That kind of call buying means big financial firms and other institutional monies are positioning themselves for more upward movement in twitter pps from here.

1456,"Hello all. I figured I would lay out why I'm a long-term bull on $PINS and why it is one of my favorite names within the social media advertising universe. First of all let's understand the value propositions for $PINS from both an advertiser and a user perspective: Starting with the users. Users love $PINS because it's simply a different type of platform. This isn't a platform where the most engagement (likes, comments, etc.) wins (like $TWTR or $FB). It's an inspiration engine of sorts. If you want to get ideas for a vacation, or how to redecorate your house you use $PINS. $PINS is like an inspiration search engine. The more you show $PINS about what you enjoy on the platform, the more they can curate specific content to you. The social aspect is the exchanging of inspiration. This leaves users with a sweet taste in their mouth after using the platform, whereas $FB and $TWTR users tend to be more bitter after using the app (think of the crazy political discourse on those apps). The stats back it up: 47% of $PINS users have an intent to purchase vs. mid to high teens on other platforms. This isn't a social media platform, it's social commerce.For advertisers: Users have high purchase intent, there is a lot of first party data that $PINS has on platform to better target and curate ads, and it doesn't have the PR backlash of advertising on $TWTR or $FB. Sure, you might not get the third party targeting, and the automated ad platform is still in the early innings, but the long-term value proposition for advertisers is there: 459 million people are looking for inspiration.

With days like today, we have to keep a longer-term context in perspective. Understand the long-term narrative, and discount back to present value. So here goes...$PINS is the most unique ""social media platform"" available from both a user and advertiser perspective. So unique in fact, that I would only use the term social media platform as a loose descriptor. Pinterest is really an eCommerce search engine of sorts. Users use the Pinterest platform as a way of gaining inspiration. Whether it be fashion, home decor, or travel, Pinterest is an inspiration engine. Compared to $FB or $TWTR, where users are left in a generally negative headspace after using the app, $PINS users have a generally more positive experience. Why? Because they're being inspired. It's that simple.This positivity on the platform correlates to sticky engagement (emphasis on sticky). As you use Pinterest more and more, the platform collects more and more data on your interests, your taste, and other important insights into how you are inspired. Why is this important? It means Pinterest is able to understand a lot about their users, using merely first party/on-platform insights. They aren't really subject to third party targeting (think third party ad cookies) and they won't see much of a headwind from $AAPL's IDFA change (if/when it ever happens). Simply put, $PINS just works for advertisers. We see it in $PINS users' purchasing behavior. Out of all the social media platforms, $PINS has the highest percentage of users who purchase a product after using the platform. $PINS is monetizing its user base at ~$3/MAU annually (as of 2020). Keep in mind, peer $FB is monetizing at ~$30/MAU annually (again as of 2020). So, you could argue the attack opportunity from monetization alone is 10x. This neglects any further growth in the user base as Pinterest evolves and expands (especially internationally).Yes, on a short-term basis it's expensive. Yes, there is a lot of execution risk. But take a long-term view. We're at ~$45 billion in market cap, for a fundamental story that could be worth ~$100B+ one day (my view). Right now, 2021YE PT is ~$130/share based on 2030 valuation discounted back to year end value. Will update you all in the future. Long $PINS",0.9921

2275,Been in the market for 30 years and can tell you exactly what happened and what will happen next. 2 days before earnings there was 160K Calls sold and 140K Puts just for July 27th exp. Which was VERY high for TWTR. Someone straddled the stock hard and needed a big movement in either direction at least 9% of the closing price. As soon as earnings came out the user numbers were weak and they pounded it with tons of shares short. Once it sold off over 12% the avalanche just kept going. So where does it go from here. Next what needs to happen is the buyers from 33 up (weak hands) will capitulate and it will bottom out over the next week. It should form a base here shortly and stick in a 2-3 dollar trading range for a few weeks. Then it will follow the direction of the market. I think it would be a good buy in that 28 range as they are finally learning how to monetize their user base. I can easily see this back in the high 30's or even 40's after next Q earnings.,0.9448

A CEO grows a business and should not be using it as his personal toy, soapbox whatever. Worse for the shareholders of TWTR, Dorsey has gone down a path where he is alienating half of the users of the company’s product. One would think Dorsey would welcome all to grow a business not shrink it. The wise CEO of any business never let’s his personal opinions be known, let alone effect in such a negative way the company he oversees prospects which are dimming. Remember though destroying TWTR would have no negative impact on his life because his core holdings lay with the other company he runs and seems to be engaged in favorably and is growing this business well. The company is Square.As a reminder, or as a PSA More of Mr. Dorsey's wealth is concentrated in the financial company Square. He owns about 13 percent of the company's outstanding shares, a holding worth about $4.9 billion as of Friday, while he controls about 2 percent of Twitter's outstanding shares, worth about $531 million.Now explain to me how TWTR shareholders continue to tolerate Dorsey’s destructive behavior.Good day all.",0.9761

2908,"In order to understand why $SNAP is trading where it's trading (valuation wise), we have to understand the story and the long-term picture. Here it is (from a bullish perspective: $SNAP delivers comparable ad ROI returns to that of $FB and gets similar ARPU grab to $FB (~$45-$50/DAU annually). Keep in mind, $SNAP will likely drive far more advertiser value than $TWTR long-term while $TWTR is already monetizing at $16-$17/DAU annually.In addition, $SNAP continues to expand its international use as the rebuilt Android design draw in the international crowd. Keep in mind that $SNAP is still early-innings in many of these international markets, so there is a lot of room for expansion. So, let's value $SNAP. What's it really worth. Well, to understand that, let's try to think about where the business will be in a decade. Here are the numbers behind the narrative:- ARPU of $45- DAUs of 500mln- Revenue of $22.5bln- 87% gross margins ($6 of CoRPU, mostly infrastructure/revenue share, and content creation costs)- ~$6 billion in OpEx (vs. ~$2.2B in 2020)On the current share count of ~1.5B shares, 2030 $SNAP is doing ~$9/share in EPS. Assuming a 4% earnings yield (basically 25x earnings) for a high margin, high growth tech business, which is roughly in line with present-day $FB, then $SNAP can be worth ~$225/share in 2030. Discounting back at ~7%/year (low rate environment, moderating equity beta, low ERP) I'm at a 2022 year end PT of ~$125/share.",0.9899

2922,"(Twitter): A lot of folks weren't happy with Twitter's Q4 earnings report last week. I'm not one of those people.Twitter stock is still up slightly since the year began, but has fallen 12% since reporting earnings last week. Mostly, this is because Twitter announced weaker-than-expected sales guidance, and a smaller-than-expected number of monetizable daily active users (mDAU) for its service. But from my perspective, the fact that Twitter is purging fake and bot Twitter accounts from its rolls, and zeroing in on tracking the growth of its most active customers, does two good things.First, it focuses the company's (and investors') attention on Twitter's most profitable accounts. And second, it resets growth expectations to focus on a much smaller base -- that subset of total accounts, which can now presumably grow at a faster pace.Now, analysts haven't yet had a chance to reset their expectations for Twitter's growth, and are still calling for Twitter to grow earnings at about 19%. This suggests that Twitter stock at 19 times earnings is only fairly valued at present. If the company ends up growing faster than 19%, however (as I think possible), then the stock could arguably be cheaper than it looks.That makes right now -- early February and right after the post-earnings sell-off -- a great time to buy Twitter stock.This winner has been dragged down by other players",0.9964

It's happened before, but $SNAP's platform has grown and evolved since then, adding new, entrenching features to retain and add users. In addition, because of it's privacy-centric and content-moderation lite structure, $SNAP will not incur costs that a $FB or $TWTR would from content moderation, meaning their operating margins could actually be much higher long-term than anything $FB or $TWTR is doing. At the end of the day, I'm focused on the long-term of this company. The biggest concern about this company is it's valuation. And believe me, I understand the concern. At ~15.7x '22 revenue, it's not cheap. Or is it? Let me break down my valuation for this business, and why it could generate so much more in returns than $FB or $TWTR.",0.9836

3334,"Twitter needs to revamp the ""verified user"" system by allowing anyone who sets up a real, personal account to become verified. Verified users should then be able to link a payment method to their accounts use Square to establish an e-commerce platform between verified users. Twitter should then buy Etsy and make people's Etsy shops an extension of their Twitter accounts where other people can shop. Etsy is the perfect platform for this activity, is the right price, and a great company. They then should work on establishing Etsy user-user marketplaces similar to Facebook marketplace groups or ""buy/sell/trade"" subreddits. We need to put the cash pile to work and capitalize on e-commerce and use Squares infrastructure as a big advantage.As far as conversation and content, Twitter needs to breathe some life into the hashtag by embedding the hashtag into a tweet rather than just text that goes in the middle of a tweet. I think this would increase hashtag usage and allow Twitter to make hashtag forums in a similar way that Reddit has done with subreddits. Users should be able to follow these forums and make it a place for people to easily engage in quality conversation and information the way Reddit has done. Twitter would then consist of the Feed-Moments-Forums-Market modules where there is something for everyone, new ways to generate revenue, increased depth of conversation, and Twitter can exercise its strengths.Long term I would also love to see Twitter capitalize on its current relationship and form a partnership with the publishing industry by allowing users to pay to subscribe to specific outlets ""premium"" pages where you can view quality, 3rd party content without leaving Twitter.",0.9957

O’Keefe alleged Twitter of subjecting him to “hatred, contempt, and ridicule.” The allegedly untrue statements “tended to diminish the esteem, respect, goodwill, or confidence,” according to Bloomberg. O’Keefe sought undetermined damages and a court injunction preventing Twitter from making false statements about him. Project Veritas has faced flak for its deceptively edited secret recordings maligning groups and companies, including Planned Parenthood, CNN, and the Washington Post. Twitter banned O’Keefe from the platform on Thursday for breaching its platform manipulation and spam policy through multiple account operations. O’Keefe had announced the defamation suit when Twitter banned him.Price action: TWTR shares traded lower by 3.12% at $65.82 on the last check Tuesday.""",-0.9831

BTIG Research's Richard Greenfield raised his price target on Twitter on Friday to 30 from 25, saying the company was in the early stages of a multiyear turnaround.""""The end result has been not just more users of the Twitter platform, but a far more engaged user base coming back more often on a daily basis and spending significantly more time on the platform each day,"" Greenfield wrote. His report did not make reference to the Facebook news. The two forces that will driving the stock price UP are: 1) very possible outstanding 4th Q earning results, and 2) potential takeover target. Just keep in mind, because this stock was beat so bad in 2016 and the first half of 2017, only less that 50% of the funds own TWTR. It's the time for rest of fund managers to buy in, which should drive TWTR price UP significantly.",0.9933

Then they try to prove the theories to figure out the root cause. That's the process. 100 years ago Albert Einstein's created many theories that were not proven at all until now. So if you use conspiracy theory then Albert Einstein's theories were conspiracy theories for 100 years as well - right? In his theory, legendary scientist Stephen Hawking said black holes could emit radiation, it's called Hawking Radiation. Not proven, no one knows whether in future it could be proved to be true.

3528,"Twitter – Trying to re-find relevance before it is too lateIt is important to note the major demographic headwinds Twitter is facing. Youth and Millennials are not flocking to Twitter (pardon for the pun) except in rare cases to view announcements from their favorite pastimes (sports, music, entertainment, finance, politics). They very much prefer Snapchat, Pinterest and Instagram (plus many one-off versions thereof). Twitter exists for them, but only in passing. They are the future of communication and social media. Jack & Company would prize this demographic if it could break into it better.To the youth of today, Twitter (which has been around FOREVER in their minds) is the Yahoo! of yesteryear. I know of what I speak, my millennial son (& daughter) refuse to check Twitter even for information about his own college sports team (he is on)! They are addicted to the other venues; he and my daughter have no interest in what Lady Gaga had for lunch or how good or bad whatever administration in office is.On the opposite end of the spectrum are the Boomers who comprise ~30% of the US population. They live, breath and die Facebook (connect to family, friends). Remember the commercial where the lady used Post-it notes for her posts on the dry erase board? That captured many a boomer’s attention. Within the past year some created secondary ‘social media’ Twitter accounts to discuss politics. As-of late, few have stayed, but many have fled back to the friendly confines of Facebook.In the middle is where Jack & Co. exist, the Gen-X, Gen-Z and other folk between 32 and 55. They want to know stuff and they want to know now. They do have very solid buying power and are attractive to advertisers. With the new business model they are working on, he and the executive team are trying to upsell this demographic the best they can. Announcing paid content, paid accounts to follow, and anything that could generate revenue off the main focus group.It is unfortunate, and not likely, the other ends of the social media demographic pie will ever migrate; Twitter management knows this only too well. As the millennials age, they will take up more and more room on the social media spectrum and unfortunately, Yahoo! (sorry, I meant Twitter) is not going to be in their wheelhouse.Many of that middle group are now exiting for different discussion venues, and that is important loss Jack & Co. have to overcome. Twitter is a STATUS application. In the ‘biz’ we call it ‘push communications’. You can ‘push’ out content and status, but as for the true ‘social’ backbone, it is very narrow; Twitter was never engineered to be a BLOG. Remember, they even reported user interactions down in Q4 and we have yet to even see a taste of Q1.Telegram is a MAJOR apple cart disrupter for Twitter. They are engineered to be a major ‘push’ engine. Channels are subscribed to and push information to users. There are discussions in Chat Channels, but nothing compared to the subscribed channels with folk waiting for information.Why do I bring up Telegram? In a short amount of time they have almost doubled the number of users Twitter has. They are growing quickly. There is ALWAYS a new kid on the block trying to win the social media beat down game.Parler you say? Niche only. Folk disgruntled ONLY about a political outcome seem to be over there. Between it and GAB and CloutHub, they may have drained off 10% of the Twitter user attention.So where does this leave Jack & Co. They are completely redoing their business model to capture the ‘middle dollars’. Boomers, Millennials and youth won’t pay for them. Advertisements are nice but non-middle demographic folk already have one-click Amazon prime accounts and know what they want. They are getting harder and harder to influence.So where does that leave Twitter compared to the big dog, Facebook?Facebook earns $10.09 per share. It has a P/E of 25.98 given a price of $262. Facebook market cap is 745.83B. Financially speaking, they are under valued for a social media platform.Twitter earns -$1.44 per share and has no P/E. Twitter market cap is 61.91B. Twitter with a current price of $77 would have to earn $4 per share to support the same P/E (check my math). Yes, they just earned 39 cents in Q4 and projecting a loss Q1 of 2021. The hill is super steep.Maybe Jack & Co. can get to $4 share in EPS, maybe not. He has to put all the boots on the ground or Twitter really has no bright future given their narrow demographic constraints and social media ‘push’ platform.Be careful out there chasing stocks or cars!",0.9993

I do not use a real name to comment on controversial topics, as I fear professional repercussions (I am not in politics or media). The targeted ads I get are cheap clickbait with photos of seemingly half naked people or medical photos that look pornographic at first glance. Twitter is failing to target ads appropriately. And, the forum is encouraging anonymity as it allows for more toxic commentary than non-anonymous Facebook. I am feeling negative right now; I think the stock price reflects recent changes and the inability to monetize “monetizable” users like myself who browse daily but don’t follow too many people and have no followers as I remain anonymous.",0.0588

No, I think it would suffice that unless a vehicle has been identified in a crime, or its owner has a warrant, there are NO traffic stops for minor infractions. A ticket can be mailed to the perpetrators address, and video and analytic evidence, speedometers, and similar will be used to adjudicate. Patrol officers wouldn’t even carry weapons. Why would they? A radical de-escalation needs to happen. Defunding is the wrong approach.

The social media platform will eventually make these notes more visible on tweets for its global audience.While it remains in a testing phase, the notes will only be visible on a separate Birdwatch site.""We believe this approach has the potential to respond quickly when misleading information spreads, adding context that people trust and find valuable,"" Twitter said.Related Link: Tesla Seeks A 'Specialist' To Address 'Social Media Escalations' Aimed At CEO Elon MuskWhy It's Important: Twitter's initiative follows interviews with more than 100 individuals ""across the political spectrum,"" the company said.

In most publicly traded corporations this would be tolerated for no more than a nanosecond.His actions intentionally injured the return on investment of shareholders and taking such actions violated the basic fiduciary rights investors expect to be upheld. Given that the top 10 owners of the 751 million shares of Twitter’s stock are all financial services and mutual fund companies there are a lot of shareholders that have said expectations.And last week Jack Dorsey purposely and with malice of forethought made all of them take a bath. He did so without any justification for his actions as it pertained to the welfare of the corporation. His actions caused the company to lose 16 percent of stock value—close to $7 billion in actual dollars—and in essence killed its ability to deliver its number one product: an audience.So there are plenty of reasons shareholders, the public, and former Twitter users should consider legal recourse.""",-0.4063

4643,I thought freedom of speech is when you can voice a different perspective on truth. The research you do to make a winning stock trade should also be made in how you understand the news ! Follow a variety of news outlets and watch a half hour each day of MSNBC FOX CNN and even 15 minutes of NEWSMAX. By doing this you will have a great balance on what the truth is. If you follow news on the net such as Twitter or Facebook and focus on as many as two similar articles whether positive or negative those platform's algorithms will feed you similar stories backing up the same view. This puts people in a herd of thinkers that could follow lies and false beliefs. These algorithms are not acceptable to freedom of finding the truth ! It could lead many down a dark rabbit hole. Many who lost work because of covid shut downs seemed to want to follow reasons why they lost their jobs. Its because of covid and I feel their pain. Just as the algorithmic codes run the stock market we still do our research to see the truth.please understand sites like Twitter and Facebook haven't focused on what's true because they make greater fees if they take you down whatever rabbit hole you choose. Remember your worth more than your financial success. Things will get better you have to have social emotional physical and spiritual success in your life to be balanced. I know most or at least many feel financial success may be the greatest of them all ! Know that covid has tested each of us and many are fed-up with life !

The company will not be required to make any additional payments.In addition, under the terms of the settlement, Twitter’s insurers will pay $38 million to the company that will be used for general corporate purposes.

Their decline began in 2020 and in a few short years they’re going to be in a free fall as the public confidence in them rapidly erodes. A major realignment will take place and MICROSOFT is going to emerge as the dominant leader because of a spectacular growth in its revenue and profitability. Coupled with the fact that CEO Nadella is a level headed person focused on Microsoft’s growth and not activism, investors will see the value in its stock. I believe even more investment will flow into the $MSFT stock starting this year.My prediction for other stocks:1 Investors will start realizing that $AMZN’s valuation is significantly higher than its peers. I believe the stock won’t surpass the ATH it saw in 2020. It is quite likely that the stock price may decline during 2021.2 $AAPL stock will likely grow higher during 2021, but its high flying days are over. Apple car is just a concept and it will be several years before a physical product is launched. In the meantime, Tesla Cybertruck and a possible low priced car may already be in the roads, thereby making Tesla the undisputed leader. It will be very difficult to penetrate its market. I see no innovation from Apple and investors will see that too.3 Stocks like $GOOG, $FB, $TWTR will likely stagnate and commence MASSIVE declines. I expect that regulations by governments around the world will act as catalysts to their decline.4 Other tech stocks like $WDAY, $NOW, $CRM will likely have more realistic P/E.",0.9655

7712,"Stock quotes in this article: TWTRAfter Thursday's column, I feel it is the right time to delineate my case against Twitter (TWTR) . So much of what I read in the financial media (not on Twitter, as I deactivated my account last week) on stocks is subjective, numbers-free blather, and in fact quite useless. So I have made it clear that Twitter is awful AND awfully overvalued, but let's focus on the second part.How about a little actual financial analysis to bolster an opinion on a stock? Trust me, it feels good, almost as good as deleting your Twitter account!First, we start with revenues. I am limited in space in this column, so won't have time to delve into Twitter's profitability metrics, but we live in a world where tech companies are valued based multiples of ""revs,"" so I will stick with that. The key to any analysis of financial statements is disaggregation.For Twitter we start -- and finish -- with the one metric given by management: mDAUs, or monetizable daily active users. Twitter changed to this metric in February 2019, and, in and of itself, it is meaningless. But it is a good base for modeling. Twitter's recent quarterly report showed 187 million mDAUs with 36 million users in the U.S., and 152 million abroad. I am assuming the difference is due to rounding.That's where Jack Dorsey's ship will start to sink. Twitter -- and every social media company -- receives a strong valuation based on user base figures that are full of people who don't actually use the service, but do have an account. But with this latest movement -- of which I am glad to be a part -- folks are deactivating their Twitter accounts, not just ignoring them.Those user numbers are going to plummet. I would expect this to happen when first-quarter figures are reported in April, not as much when full-year results are reported Feb. 9. How low can they go? Well Twitter's mDAU base is small to begin with, so that the initial drop-off will be quite noticeable.It is the international figure that is more difficult to divine. Twitter's public affairs division Thursday astoundingly criticized the government of Uganda for restricting social media to prevent interference in an upcoming election (didn't Twitter just do that, repeatedly, here in the U.S.?) but the fact of the matter is that there are governments around the world that are authoritarian. Twitter has never been available in mainland China, for instance.On a real user basis, I would expect Twitter usage to fall by about 50% here in the U.S., and for the service to be banned in some other countries, and for the others to fall in line with the U.S.'s decline. That gets you to 36*.5 + 50*0 (the banned) and 102 *.5 (the non-banned internationals.) That leaves you with a real user base of 69 million for Twitter. Of course they will twist the numbers to appear better using mDAUs IOUs, PDQs, or whatever new metric they can concoct. On Twitter's reported figures the revenue per mDAU (best to use a rolling four-quarter figure for revenues to produce an annualized number) was $18.11 in the third quarter, which is astounding. Obviously no one would ever pay to use Twitter, and I was unaware that advertisers were interested in the global demographics. Extract that figure -- that's aggressive, by the way, the r/u will fall as the user base falls -- and apply it to our real user base figure of 69 million, and you get a real, annualized revenues figure of $1.25 billion for Twitter. This contrasts with the full-year figure of $3.46 billion in 2019 and my estimate for 2020 revenue at Twitter of $3.25 billion. This company was already shrinking...but now the dam will burst, in my view.Even after this week's pullback, TWTR shares, inexplicably, were trading at slightly above 10x trailing revenues as of Thursday's close. But, using our ""true"" revenue estimate of $1.25 billion, we derive a fair value for TWTR of $15.63. This ignores the fact that TWTR had over $7 billion of cash on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30, and valuation is as much an art as a science, but I am just doing a back of the envelope here.So, there's your math. Last Friday TWTR closed at $51. This Thursday It closed at $45. My fair value implies that it should be worth $16.That is a short. Regardless of what you think of the company's management, and I think I have made my opinions abundantly clear, TWTR shares are just plain overvalued. Bet against them as you are deactivating your account. It will feel good",0.9984

They were silent when every statue was pulled down Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln not matter they were silent. The media encouraged violence, with CNN & MSNBC reporting as mobs looted, and fires burning in the background they were peacefully protest. Only when polls started to show their numbers dropping did they in a loud whisper say they were against violence. What happened at the Capitol we all agree was wrong. But how easily a man dressed as a furry and the rest of the rioters made as far as they did must be answered. The Capitol Police were warned, along with the DC Mayor the day before by the FBI.

8163,"JIM COLLINS Jan 15, 2021 | 11:45 AM ESTStocks quotes in this article: TWTRAfter Thursday's column, I feel it is the right time to delineate my case against Twitter (TWTR) . So much of what I read in the financial media (not on Twitter, as I deactivated my account last week) on stocks is subjective, numbers-free blather, and in fact quite useless. So I have made it clear that Twitter is awful AND awfully overvalued, but let's focus on the second part.How about a little actual financial analysis to bolster an opinion on a stock? Trust me, it feels good, almost as good as deleting your Twitter account!First, we start with revenues. I am limited in space in this column, so won't have time to delve into Twitter's profitability metrics, but we live in a world where tech companies are valued based multiples of ""revs,"" so I will stick with that. The key to any analysis of financial statements is disaggregation.For Twitter we start -- and finish -- with the one metric given by management: mDAUs, or monetizable daily active users. Twitter changed to this metric in February 2019, and, in and of itself, it is meaningless. But it is a good base for modeling. Twitter's recent quarterly report showed 187 million mDAUs with 36 million users in the U.S., and 152 million abroad. I am assuming the difference is due to rounding.That's where Jack Dorsey's ship will start to sink. Twitter -- and every social media company -- receives a strong valuation based on user base figures that are full of people who don't actually use the service, but do have an account. But with this latest movement -- of which I am glad to be a part -- folks are deactivating their Twitter accounts, not just ignoring them.Those user numbers are going to plummet. I would expect this to happen when first-quarter figures are reported in April, not as much when full-year results are reported Feb. 9. How low can they go? Well Twitter's mDAU base is small to begin with, so that the initial drop-off will be quite noticeable.It is the international figure that is more difficult to divine. Twitter's public affairs division Thursday astoundingly criticized the government of Uganda for restricting social media to prevent interference in an upcoming election (didn't Twitter just do that, repeatedly, here in the U.S.?) but the fact of the matter is that there are governments around the world that are authoritarian. Twitter has never been available in mainland China, for instance.On a real user basis, I would expect Twitter usage to fall by about 50% here in the U.S., and for the service to be banned in some other countries, and for the others to fall in line with the U.S.'s decline. That gets you to 36*.5 + 50*0 (the banned) and 102 *.5 (the non-banned internationals.) That leaves you with a real user base of 69 million for Twitter. Of course they will twist the numbers to appear better using mDAUs IOUs, PDQs, or whatever new metric they can concoct. On Twitter's reported figures the revenue per mDAU (best to use a rolling four-quarter figure for revenues to produce an annualized number) was $18.11 in the third quarter, which is astounding. Obviously no one would ever pay to use Twitter, and I was unaware that advertisers were interested in the global demographics. Extract that figure -- that's aggressive, by the way, the r/u will fall as the user base falls -- and apply it to our real user base figure of 69 million, and you get a real, annualized revenues figure of $1.25 billion for Twitter. This contrasts with the full-year figure of $3.46 billion in 2019 and my estimate for 2020 revenue at Twitter of $3.25 billion. This company was already shrinking...but now the dam will burst, in my view.Even after this week's pullback, TWTR shares, inexplicably, were trading at slightly above 10x trailing revenues as of Thursday's close. But, using our ""true"" revenue estimate of $1.25 billion, we derive a fair value for TWTR of $15.63. This ignores the fact that TWTR had over $7 billion of cash on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30, and valuation is as much an art as a science, but I am just doing a back of the envelope here.So, there's your math. Last Friday TWTR closed at $51. This Thursday It closed at $45. My fair value implies that it should be worth $16.That is a short. Regardless of what you think of the company's management, and I think I have made my opinions abundantly clear, TWTR shares are just plain overvalued. Bet against them as you are deactivating your account. It will feel good!",0.9984
