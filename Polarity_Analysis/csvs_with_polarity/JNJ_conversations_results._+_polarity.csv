Software and electronic are changing almost every 6 months and they are not like drug development that takes several years. Looking at software/hardware as a drug is killing the company. ABT used to have ABBV, but it realized that medical equipment is totally different from pharma sector.They broke up the company into ABT and ABBV and both have performed excellent since then.

It may stays in this area for a few weeks or months but it will be much higher than $120 by the end of this year. There are many reasons to support my statement and some are already public info. Medical devices and consumer products are going thru many changes and JNJ is positioning itself to be a clear leader in the medical devices in addition changing most of its consumer products.

580,"Excellent results from a phase 1/2a JNJ COVID-19.Johnson & Johnson Posts Interim Results from Phase 1/2a Clinical Trial of its Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine CandidateInterim analysis from Phase 1/2a First-in-Human trial supports further clinical development of investigational vaccine candidate JNJ-78436735 (also known as Ad26.COV2.S)Interim analysis from the ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate (JNJ-78436735) was posted today on the pre-print server medRxiv.The data demonstrate that a single dose of JNJ-78436735 induced a strong neutralizing antibody response in nearly all participants aged 18 years and older and was generally well-tolerated. Immune responses were similar across the age groups studied, including older adults.The ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial is designed to study the safety and immunogenicity of two dose levels of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, and as single and two-dose schedules. The interim analysis showed that a single dose induced a robust immune response and was generally well-tolerated. These data are consistent with preclinical studies, published in the scientific journal Nature, which showed that a single dose of the vaccine successfully prevented subsequent infection and provided complete protection in the lungs of nonhuman primates.Based on these findings, the single dose of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate of 5x1010 virus particles (vp) has been selected for further evaluation in the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE clinical trial. The Company also plans on running a Phase 3 clinical trial of a two-dose regimen of JNJ-78436735 versus placebo later this year.The full set of results will be published once the complete Phase 1/2a trial data are available.Immune Response DataSeroconversion (the development of detectable antibodies) was observed in 99 percent of participants aged 18-55 years of age. 98 percent of participants were positive for neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at day 29 post-vaccination. The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate elicited strong antibody responses, strong T cell responses, and a Th1 response, believed to be protective against the risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease.Immunogenicity (the ability to trigger an immune response) data from participants aged 65 years of age and above were available for the first 15 participants at the time of this post, with strong humoral and cellular immune responses elicited in all elderly participants who received a single dose of Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate.Immune responses were similar across the age groups studied, including older adults.Safety and Tolerability DataInterim safety data from the Phase 1/2a trial indicated that the majority of adverse events reported were mild to moderate (grade 1 and grade 2) in severity and generally occurred on the day of vaccination with symptoms generally resolving that day, or the following day. Two serious adverse events were reported, the first for hypotension which the investigator determined to not be vaccine related, and the second was a participant with a fever who was hospitalized due to suspicion of having COVID-19 but recovered within 12 hours. No grade 4 (life-threatening) adverse events, solicited or unsolicited, were reported in any cohort, and no participant discontinued the study due to an adverse event. The analysis showed there was a trend toward higher reactogenicity with the higher vaccine dose and with younger age.In clinical studies investigating vaccines, it is well known that vaccines often induce local and systemic side-effects that are mild, to moderate, and transient without consequences. In vaccine clinical trials these type of side effects are actively sought (""solicited""). The interim safety data in this Phase 1/2a study is blinded to ensure participants and trial investigators are not made aware which participants received a single dose of Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate versus a placebo.Study DesignThis Phase 1/2a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aims to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate at two dose levels, administered intramuscularly as single-dose or two-dose schedules, eight weeks apart, in healthy adults 18-55 and greater than 65 years of age. The study is ongoing at multiple clinical sites in Belgium and the United States.",0.9995

We were so excited about those data for a lot of reasons. I believe that it suggested this drug is doing what we wanted to do. In fact, doing a bit faster than we expected. And so we are going with those data and probably some additional data to the fda to talk about changing endpoints and changing size and maybe changing the duration of the study. Until we have those discussions, it’s probably not appropriate for us to speculate on the specifics of what those changes could be. I don’t want to get out in front of this conversation. We’ve had a very good collaborative relationship with the fda as it relates to this program, we expect this to continue to be collaborative, and I just don’t want to jeopardize that.

We are clear and above 20, 50 and 200 MA that is very bullish. In addition, we are clear and below Upper BB ($134.19) but above Mid BB ($129) which is very bullish point and JNJ can go to Upper BB easily in near future.However, We have been at this point for a few times and JNJ struggled to pass it a few times until we broke it once in the past. So, the reason for hesitation is this resistance but eventually, JNJ will overcome this resistance and will head to at least $140. It may take a few days or a few times but it is heading to $140 one way or another. All JNJ needs some times and some patience. Oh, all moving averages are trending up and 50 MA will cross 200 MA in near future that is called Golden Cross.

The company received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance to market the mechanical clot removal, or thrombectomy, device in May and is launching EMBOTRAP II at this week's Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery (SNIS) 15(th) Annual Meeting.""The EMBOTRAP II is an important new device for treating stroke patients and an important advancement in mechanical thrombectomy,"" said Andrew DeNardo, MD, an interventional neuroradiologist with Goodman Campbell Brain & Spine, who along with John Scott, MD, Daniel Sahlein, MD, and Richard Paulsen, MD, recently performed thrombectomies with the device at Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital and St. Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis.The EMBOTRAP II Device, with its proprietary dual-layer design, engages and grips stroke-inducing blood clots differently than other stent retrievers, allowing a doctor to maintain engagement and control of the clot with minimal compression during removal. It is indicated for use within eight hours of symptom onset.""Blood clots can originate in different parts of the body, resulting in different clot types,"" said Dr. Scott. ""These different clot types present unique retrieval challenges during mechanical thrombectomy. The design of the EMBOTRAP II Device helps minimize these challenges and my early experience has been positive.""",0.983

The BBC reports that the complication rate from hernia repair surgery using hernia mesh could be as high as an astounding 30% of England's 570,000 hernia repair patients. Many of the hernia mesh patients have been left in chronic pain, unable to work, and some even unable to stand up or walk. Hernia mesh victims have been rendered unable to live the once active lifestyle they enjoyed.Hernia mesh has been used in hernia repair surgery in England since 1990 and officials now fear that a cover-up may be in place. England's health officials are quoted as saying that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, England's version of the US Food and Drug Administration, did not do enough to listen to the concerns of hernia mesh patients complaining about the device's adverse health consequences. According to the BBC article, the Royal College of Surgeons continues to support the use of hernia mesh in spite of its failure rate. The Royal College of Surgeons said, ""mesh implants were the most effective way to deal with a hernia."" Physiomesh problems include pain, infection, hernia recurrence, adhesion, scar-like tissues form, attaching the internal abdominal tissues together, intestinal blockage, bleeding, and perforation of internal tissues and organs.As in the United States, certain hernia repair surgeons in England saw the potential for hernia repair mesh to do more harm than good and continued to repair hernias with the traditional suture method that had worked so well for decades. Dr. Ulrike Muschaweck was one of those doctors and she told the BBC that she not only continued to perform a hernia repair with the old tried and true suture method, but also has been forced to perform over 3000 hernia mesh removal procedures. The doctor is quoted as saying that nearly 100% of the hernia mesh removal procedure she performed left her patients ""pain-free.""Reports from England as well as all over Europe are important as medical devices are manufactured and marketed by international companies that know no borders. In fact, the Ethicon Physiomesh was recently withdrawn from sales by global medical device manufacturer Johnson & Johnson after German hernia complaint consumer watchdog Herniamed announced that they had received an alarming number of requests for revision surgery from those using the Ethicon Physiomesh.A report registered by the US National Institute of Health clearly blamed hernia mesh failure on the polypropylene component of the device is incompatible with organic tissues in the human body. The device has been shown to degrade, crumple, buckle, harden, and then migrate within the human abdominal cavity before lodging itself in the lowest possible point, the intestines and bowels causing painful lacerations, bleeding and potentially dangerous blockages.More Recent Ethicon Physiomesh Lawsuit News:Senator Rand Paul Chooses a Canadian Hospital Specializing in Non-Mesh Hernia Repair | 1/19/2019Hernia Mesh Patients Fear Comparisons To Failed Pelvic Mesh Devices | 1/15/2019University Hospital Continues to Use Hernia Mesh | 1/8/2019Hernia Repair Physicians Are Dealing With Hernia Repair Mesh Failures | 1/1/2019Hernia Repair Doctors Are Shunning Repair Mesh And Returning To Traditional Hernia Repair Methods | 12/20/2018Hernia Mesh Failure Symptoms Should Be Addressed Immediately | 12/18/",-0.9448

BIV201 is a new drug candidate currently being tested in a mid-stage (Phase 2a) clinical study in patients with refractory ascites due to advanced liver cirrhosis. The Company previously secured an Orphan Drug designation for terlipressin for treating ascites, and is exploring additional Orphan designation opportunities.""An estimated 12,000 to 33,000 Americans develop HRS each year,"" said BioVie CEO Terren Peizer. ""Our novel drug candidate BIV201 could potentially become an effective treatment option for this condition."" Two forms of hepatorenal syndrome are recognized, Type 1 (HRS-1) and Type 2 (HRS-2), which are categorized by deterioration in kidney function. While HRS-1 involves rapidly progressing kidney failure with a high probability of death (median survival time is only 2 to 4 weeks), HRS-2 is characterized by a progressive but slower deterioration in kidney function, with a longer survival time of approximately 6 months. The FDA has not approved any drug therapies specifically for treating HRS and it represents a critical unmet medical need.",0.9928

1330,"From WSJ...Plaintiff lawyers are hoping to make talc torts the next asbestos racket, but their dreams of mega-payoffs may have been shattered last week when a judge in California tossed a $417 million jury award against Johnson & Johnson .The case was brought by a 63-year-old woman with advanced ovarian cancer who had used baby powder for more than 40 years. She claimed the talc caused her cancer and that J&J knew the product was carcinogenic but failed to warn consumers. A Los Angeles jury in August awarded the plaintiff $70 million in compensatory and $347 million in punitive damages.Johnson & Johnson appealed the verdict and requested a new trial, which California superior court judge Maren Nelson granted after ripping apart the plaintiff lawyers’ arguments and evidence.For instance, trial lawyers tried to foist liability on Johnson & Johnson even though its subsidiary JJCI had manufactured baby powder after 1967. The judge noted that “the law is well established that ordinarily a holding company cannot be held liable for the acts of its wholly owned subsidiary” absent evidence that the consumer unit was an agent of the company, which the lawyers did not show.The judge also deemed the plaintiff’s evidence lacking. No causal link has been established between talc and ovarian cancer, as even one plaintiff expert testified. Lawyers sought support from an epidemiologist, but the judge noted that the “expert did not properly employ the methodology she espoused.”While the plaintiff attorneys then sought “to argue that epidemiological studies are not required to establish causation,” the judge determined this is “not persuasive given [the studies] were utilized for such a purpose.” The judge also dismissed the plaintiff’s unscientific contention that the condom industry’s discontinuation of talc after 1994 demonstrated its carcinogenic risk.“The documents and testimony, granting all evidence in favor of [the plaintiff] do not support liability . . . much less support a finding of clear and convincing evidence that a punitive damage was appropriate,” the judge concluded, adding that the “compensatory verdict is plainly excessive.”After the Los Angeles jury verdict, plaintiff attorneys had been anticipating a potential global settlement for talc claims that could be worth tens of billions of dollars. But they may get little or nothing if this is all the evidence they have.",0.9956

1407,"July 17, 2019 01:24 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Analyst ColorJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) shares are down 2% since the company reported a second-quarter earnings beat on Tuesday morning.Johnson & Johnson reported a 42% increase in net profit in the quarter. Revenue of $20.56 billion was down 1.3% from a year ago but also topped consensus analyst estimates of $20.29 billion. The company also reiterated its full-year earnings guidance and raised its sales forecast, but investors seem increasingly concerned about the potential negative impacts of opioid and talc litigation.Several analysts have weighed in on Johnson & Johnson since the report. Here’s a sampling of what they had to say.Near-Term Litigation RiskWells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen said the opioid overhang could be settled by the end of 2019, but talc litigation could drag on.“The Daubert hearing in the talc case scheduled to start on 7/22 may give some sense of the strength of the case for the plaintiffs and defendant (JNJ) and thus offer some visibility on how many of these cases (85% of talc cases could be affected by the Daubert hearing) could move forward,” Biegelsen wrote in a note.Bank of America analyst Bob Hopkins said results were slightly better than expected thanks to strong international pharma growth and less generic headwinds.“Until we get more clarity on some of the litigation facing JNJ, we expect the stock to remain range-bound,” Hopkins wrote.Underlying ValueMorgan Stanley analyst David Lewis said an acceleration in the pharma market heading into 2020 would typically be a bullish catalyst, but the stock performance is instead tied to legal risk for the time being.“Our valuation analysis suggests the stock is discounting $35B in value but the path to clarity on talc/opioid is opaque,” Lewis wrote.Raymond James analyst Jayson Bedford said there is still plenty of drama ahead for Johnson & Johnson investors in the near term, but the company has solid fundamentals and the stock has an attractive valuation.“While acknowledging that the stock will continue to be volatile on the litigation headlines, we remain comfortable with our estimates, expect revenue growth to accelerate in 2020, and believe the valuation offers downside support,” Bedford wrote.Ratings And Price TargetsMorgan Stanley has an Equal-Weight rating and $145 target.Wells Fargo has an Outperform rating and $157 target.Raymond James has an Outperform rating and $146 target.Bank of America has a Neutral rating and $150 target.The stock traded around $132.10 per share at time of publication",0.9973

Very high likelihood that this will be investigated and found to be a very rare side effect (less than one in a million doses) and then vaccinations will be authorized again. All vaccines have low levels of side effects and that does not make them unsafe - have to put this against the death rate from covid at 1.8% with 20% having severe or long lasting symptoms and then these very rare side effects are not a risk that should stop vaccinations continuing,-0.668

(NVAX), a late-stage biotechnology company developing next-generation vaccines for serious infectious diseases, today announced it has identified a coronavirus vaccine candidate, NVX-CoV2373, a stable, prefusion protein made using Novavax’ proprietary nanoparticle technology, and will initiate a first-in-human trial in mid-May. Novavax’ proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant will be incorporated with NVX-CoV2373 in order to enhance immune responses and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies.NVX-CoV2373 was shown to be highly immunogenic in animal models measuring spike protein-specific antibodies, antibodies that block the binding of the spike protein to the receptor and wild-type virus neutralizing antibodies. High levels of spike protein-specific antibodies with ACE-2 human receptor binding domain blocking activity and SARS-CoV-2 wild-type virus neutralizing antibodies were observed after a single immunization. In addition, the already high microneutralization titers seen after one dose increased eight fold with a second dose. High titer microneutralizing antibodies are generally accepted evidence that a vaccine is likely to be protective in humans.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novavax-identifies-coronavirus-vaccine-candidate-100010906.html",0.9974

Many news reports have smeared efficacy results together causing quite a bit of confusion. Intended result? Your call. Some constants to live by. A 2 dose vaccine will always yield higher efficacy than a single dose. A single dose will always require the highest dose tolerable to achieve the desired result. mRNA vaccines will always require extreme cold storage. DNA vaccines are always less cold dependent. Vaccine trial results today reflect major concerns at the time the study started. Future concerns will focus on 1) how well a vaccine is against mutation variants 2) long term and possibly mucosal immunity 3) midstream manufacturing shortages, 4) portability.

If anything, NOT focusing on imetelstat today is a negative. https://t.co/UKOlyO799ETweet from Adam Feurstein This is the first time he put the possibility of being wrong into his equation. His thesis is that JNJ will drop imetelstat because they didn't focus on imetelstat in the cc? Pretty flimsy Adam. JNJ definitely reaffirmed they would be making a decision whether or not to continue the collaboration by the end of the month. Obviously, yesterday wasn't the day for the announcement. JNJ did prominently identify imetelstat as a potential blockbuster drug to be filed for an NME application in the near term future for MF. Meanwhile they have surely enrolled numerous patients in phase 3 IMERGE who are chomping at the bit to start receiving imetelstat and even listed imetelstat for unapproved use as a compassionate use drug. Duh! That means one thing. ... it's working. I'm not too worried about AF's bearish opinion. His weakness is in predicting which drugs will or won't get approval. JNJ and/or FDA and/or EMA would have ended the trials by now if the drug was a dud. If JNJ were planning to drop imetelstat, they wouldn't have listed it in numerous slides, instead it would have been mysteriously, quietly missing. They certainly wouldn't have added a new indication. What wasn't said is that IMERGE is in fast track status. It's all about the results in the special expanded subset of E refractory, L & H naive, and non del 5q which are becoming clear by now. Good results here could mean advanced approval. I have a hunch the results are far better than just good.Remember, Unmet need, first and only in-class drug, huge platform potential and documented clinical remissions. Why would JNJ walk away from gross world wide sales to get out of paying 65 million? The only thing I can agree on with AF is that we will definitely know if he is right or wrong by the end of the month. Good luck longs! Go Imetelstat! : - D",0.9899

K., a man from Florida who was implanted with a TrapEase IVC Filter on March 26, 2008. He suffers from a filter that is occluded with blood clots.The 8th plaintiff is Jan George H., a man from New Jersey who was implanted with an OptEase IVC Filter in 2003. A CT scan of his abdomen shows that the filter has migrated up his vein, placing the top half of the filter above the kidney vein.The 10th plaintiff is Matthew T., a man from Alabama who was implanted with an OptEase IVC Filter on September 28, 2012. A CT scan of his abdomen shows that he suffers from an occlusion of the IVC Filter representing chronic thrombus (blood clots).The 11th plaintiff is Peggy S., a woman from Missouri who was implanted with a TrapEase IVC Filter on July 23, 2014. She underwent a successful complex retrieval of the filter via a dual approach. During the procedure, it was determined that the filter had fractured and one strut was left behind in the patient’s body.The 12th plaintiff is Virginia W., a woman from New York who was implanted with a TrapEase IVC Filter on November 1, 2010. A CT scan of her abdomen shows that all 6 prongs of the filter have perforated her vein. There is also evidence of a calcified blood clot (thrombus) in the filter.All of the plaintiffs have suffered life-threatening injuries and damages, and required extensive medical care and treatment. The plaintiffs suffered and will continue to suffer significant medical expenses, and pain and suffering, and other damages.Lawyers accuse Cordis Corporation, Johnson & Johnson, and Confluent Medical Technologies of negligence for selling defective medical devices and failing to warn about side effects.The lawsuit was filed on December 20, 2018 in the First Judicial District of the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas — Case No. RG18933991.",-0.4142

Now, doctors can prescribe it as an add-on treatment to the class of therapies called statins, which tens of millions of people worldwide take to reduce their risk of serious heart problems. In short, Amarin can now market Vascepa to patients who are taking statins, meaning that its potential revenue is much larger than before -- and the positive effect is already hitting the company's books.Sales of Vascepa drove the company's annual total net revenue to increase by 43% compared to 2019, reaching $614.1 million for 2020. But that's entirely from the U.S., and Vascepa is in the process of going global. Amarin will launch it in the E.U. later this year, and it may get another approval in China before 2022. Worldwide, the market for Vascepa could be as large as 486 million people.Finally, there's no direct competitor to the drug on the market. So, it's hard to see how Amarin could stumble, given that it has negligible debt and practically the entire world to expand into.

2623,"Q1 2018 report Q1 2018 numbers exceeded expectation of investors but some analysts tried to spin negativity based on small matters while ignoring real matters.Lets review and analyze them: 1- Baby Care dropped in US. True but analysts made so much noise for a small matter. First, Baby Care was positive or flat overall YOY in spite of constant news and article about baby power. US sale dropped by a drop like $16mm but internationally gained $18mm. So, this is nothing to make noise for revenue of $20.1B for the quarter that exceeded by $600mm from the Q1 estimate. 2- Ramicade revenue went down by $283 mm YOY because of generic. First, Ramicade still producing as a blockbuster for JNJ but the company is replacing it with other drugs. J&J has a few other drugs in IMMUNOLOGY that compensated for Ramicade and more. Stelara gained $238 mm YOY, Simponi/Simponi Aria gained $90 MM YOY and finally other new drugs gained $66 mm YOY for total of $394 mm or $111 mm higher than last year Q1 in IMMUNOLOGY. Nobody expects Remicade to produce for good. A good company replace it and that is exactly what JNJ is doing. So, why analysts don't see this clear fact? 3- Zytiga may go generic in 2019. So what? JNJ has recently expanded its labels and that's why the revenue went up by 62% ($332 mm)YOY. These new labels cannot go generic and JNJ is the only one with right to sell. So, most of Zytiga rev comes from recent labels expansion that belong to JNJ only and generic cannot touch them for several years. After all, in ONCOLOGY, JNJ is making tones of new money. The sector gained over $717 mm YOY because of Darzalex and Imbruvica and Valcade. New Sector PULMONARY gained $587 mm YOY or new money. Vision Care added $317 mm new money. One must be blind to ignore all these progresses especially new drugs that have been approved or will be approved like ERLEADA.",0.9994

2754,"Update on Therapeutic and Diagnostic Programs Targeting TDP-43 $JNJ, $RHHBY, $AVXLLausanne, Switzerland, November 1, 2018 - AC Immune SA (ACIU), a Swiss-based, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a broad pipeline focused on neurodegenerative diseases will provide updates on its product candidates at the Society for Neuroscience Meeting 2018, taking place in San Diego from November 3rd to 7th, 2018.The first update will cover the wholly-owned TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) antibody program aimed to provide novel therapeutic options for patients suffering from TDP-43 proteinopathies such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP). The second update will be on the accompanying diagnostic program focused to deliver positron emission tomography (PET) tracers specific for misfolded and aggregated TDP-43, which is non-exclusively partnered with Biogen Inc.The oral presentation entitled ""Discovery and development of diagnostics and therapeutics for TDP-43 proteinopathies"" includes data on both programs and will be presented on November 4th during the session ""Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies"" (1pm to 3.15 pm, PST; Session #188, in room SDCC 5).AC Immune is developing therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against pathological forms of the transactive response (TAR) DNA binding protein (TDP-43). Misfolded TDP-43 has been identified as the major component of pathological protein inclusions, in both ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP). It has been shown that pathological TDP-43 can spread from neuron to neuron as being described for many pathological proteins in neurodegenerative disease. This mechanism creates the opportunity to interfere with the process through application of monoclonal antibodies. AC Immune is using its proprietary SupraAntigenTM technology to raise a broad panel of monoclonal antibodies targeting misfolded TDP-43 which are currently undergoing functional evaluation. This program is wholly-owned by AC Immune.Complementary to a therapeutic approach, AC Immune is developing novel PET tracers specifically targeting pathological TDP-43 inclusions. Small molecules suitable for PET tracer development are being derived from AC Immune's proprietary MorphomerTM chemistry technology platform, which is designed to interact with misfolded and aggregated proteins. Promising small molecule hits have been identified by binding assays using patient -derived TDP-43 aggregates. The ability to precisely diagnose FTLD and other TDP-43 proteinopathies and therefore treat patients earlier and more accurately is critical to disease management that uses novel therapeutic approaches. This collaboration with Biogen Inc. was established in April 2016; it is non-exclusive, and AC Immune retains intellectual property and commercialization rights.About TDP-43TDP-43 (TAR DNA binding protein 43) is a new target in the area of neurodegenerative diseases. Misfolded, aggregated TDP-43 is found in diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy and Huntington's disease. There is growing body of evidence that the pathological aggregation of TDP-43 protein also plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease. The link of clinical features and spread of pathological TDP-43 is associated with a multitude of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and make misfolded TDP-43 a promising target for our antibody program.About TDP-43-PET tracers A brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan is an imaging test of the brain involving an imaging device and an imaging agent called a PET tracer. No TDP-43-PET tracer has received regulatory approval for commercial distribution, which represents an important medical need to diagnose precisely patients suffering from TDP-43 proteinopathies such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Once the TDP43-PET tracer is introduced to the body, it transiently enters the brain and binds to abnormal TDP-43 inclusions. Through the radiotracer on the tracer molecule, the imaging device detects the TDP-43 imaging agent and creates pictures reflecting the amount and distribution of misfolded TDP-43 in the brain.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ac-immune-present-2018-society-100115734.html?guccounter=1",0.9985

MDGL will treat patients with early-stage Nash and GALT will treat patients with advanced Nash that has developed into cirrhosis of the liver, therefore they are not competitors. Since Nash has no symptoms until late stage development to cirrhosis of the liver, GALT drug will be more widely used then MDGL. In GALT trials it was proven that there was significant reduction in fibrosis. I believe that GALT could meet the endpoint that MDGL met but I don't believe that MDGL could meet the endpoint that GALT had. Therefore I believe GALT has the better drug.

Usually it takes years to formulate and vette a new medicine, now they are able to do it in a matter of weeks/months.I would suggest we ask our politicians and their families to take rhe vaccines first and let us know how it worked out. So far tbey are all using the excuse that they don't want to jump the line, and that they are giving those in priorty situations the jab first. Note, first Pfizer then Moderna claimed they had a vaccine, one tried to one-up the other with ridiculous claims of efficacy, then , the other said, well ours is good for the south African strain, and the UK strain etc, etc.How can it be good for all strains when you do not know what yu are facing. And if that's the case, then they better get us a vaccine for the flu that actually works and while they are at it producing results so quickly they should get to work on some cure for cancer or atleast a vaccine, since they can solve these things in such short notice.

Wolfson in the District of New Jersey.In a joint status report (PDF) submitted today, in advance of a conference on January 24, the parties report that the MDL now includes claims filed by a total of 10,023 plaintiffs nationwide. In addition, more than 2,000 additional claims are pending in various state court systems, including California, Missouri, Delaware, New Jersey, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Arizona and Pennsylvania.While Judge Wilson is expected to determine the admissibility of general causation expert witness testimony this summer, over whether plaintiffs have sufficiently reliable evidence about the link between talcum powder and cancer to proceed to trial in the federal court system, a number of state court cases have already gone before juries nationwide in recent years, with a number resulting in multi-million dollar verdicts against Johnson & Johnson for failing to disclose the known risks associated with their products.The largest verdict occurred in July, when a St. Louis jury awarded 22 women $4.7 billion, including punitive damages designed to punish Johnson & Johnson. In addition, a California jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $25.7 million in May 2018, and a New Jersey jury awarded $117 million to a man diagnosed with mesothelioma due to exposure from talcum powder.At least one additional trial is currently underway in California, and a multi-plaintiff claim involving 13 different women diagnosed with ovarian cancer is expected to begin in St. Louis next month. Another trial involving claims for 24 different women is set to begin in April 2019, with third multi-plaintiff case expected to begin in August 2019.Although Johnson & Johnson has maintained that it will continue to defend the safety of their products at trial, and is pursuing appeals in each of the prior cases that resulted in damage awards, the company will face increasing pressure to negotiate talcum powder settlements to avoid a steady stream of trials in the coming months and years.Some analysts have suggested that the recent verdicts are a sign that juries find Johnson & Johnson’s trial defense lacking in credibility, and the company could face substantially greater liability and uncertainty with thousands of cases going before juries if they fail to establish a global settlement program in the future.",0.9853

The company plans to produce its COVID-19 vaccine in the Netherlands, and a facility it is updating in the United States.“We're manufacturing at risk to ensure that should the clinical development and the trials be successful, we are in a position to kind of flip the switch and ready to go, to create great access across the globe,” J&J CFO Joe Wolk told Yahoo Finance in an interview.J&J began developing its vaccine for COVID-19 in early January with its European subsidiary Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. It’s using the same biological platform Janssen uses in developmental vaccines for Ebola, Zika and Influenza.During J&J’s first quarter earnings call, Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels said the company is also negotiating with partners in Europe and Asia to produce the vaccine, and partnerships will be announced in the coming weeks.“Our goal is to enable the supply of more than 1 billion doses of the vaccine globally,” Stoffels said.Vaccine eyes early 2021 rollout",0.9968

Back a few years ago you couldn't find JNJ Tylenol products anywhere due to concern about their manufacuting processes in a number of JNJ factories. JNJ had to shut down several factories and revamp the entire manufacturing process. This tooks months. The FDA was all over JNJ during that time. If the talc used in their baby powder was so harmful the FDA would have done something by now. There have never been any requirements to put warning labels on these products. JNJ has concrete evidence and science saying that the talc they use is not harmful. Baby powder contributes about .5% of JNJ's $70B + revenue. I don't think JNJ would continue the product if they thought it would harmful to babies and the general population. It's just not worth the risk.

Owning dividend stocks backed by solidly growing cash flows can make you rich. Here are three you might want to consider... In fact, top dividend-paying companies like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and 3M (NYSE:MMM) have consistently converted 15% or more of their revenues into free cash flows (FCF). Combined, the three companies generated nearly $173 billion in revenues in 2017. That's a lot of money, and a good chunk of it is going into shareholders' pockets.

A lot.Juries and judges have ordered the health-products giant to pay billions of dollars in several recent trials over claims that J&J's signature baby powder and certain drugs and medical devices injured people, and that its marketing practices fueled the opioid-addiction epidemic.The latest: A Philadelphia jury awarded $8 billion in punitive damages last week to a man claiming his use of J&J's antipsychotic Risperdal when he was a boy caused abnormal breast enlargement. J&J has said it properly disclosed the drug's risks and benefits, and plans to appeal the verdict.In August, an Oklahoma judge ordered J&J to pay $572 million to the state for contributing to the opioid-addiction crisis, a judgment the company is appealing. Last year, a St. Louis jury found that J&J should pay $4.7 billion to 22 women and their families who alleged the company's baby powder caused ovarian cancer. J&J has said the talcum powder is safe and doesn't cause cancer; the company is appealing the decision.The New Brunswick, N.J., company faced lawsuits from at least 103,300 people or entities in U.S. courts at the middle of this year, up from the 8,580 plaintiffs pending in October 2011, according to a Wall Street Journal review of J&J's securities filings.J&J discloses the number of plaintiffs for the most significant of its product-liability cases in its filings.The number of talc-lawsuit plaintiffs surged to 15,500 as of June 30, from 1,400 in early 2016, the Journal analysis found. Plaintiffs in personal-injury lawsuits over J&J's pelvic mesh devices for women have declined from a peak of more than 55,000 pending in 2017 but still number about 24,800.J&J is challenging many of the lawsuits, rather than quickly settling, according to lawyers on both sides. ""Their natural reflex is to fight and delay, drag it out as long as they can,"" said Andy Birchfield, an attorney with Beasley Allen in Montgomery, Ala., who has sued J&J over baby powder and other products.The Risperdal damages and some other awards are likely to be reduced by judges, and possibly overturned, on appeal. Yet the losses signal J&J may ultimately have to pay a costly sum to resolve the lawsuits. The opioid litigation alone could cost J&J $5 billion to $10 billion to settle, Wells Fargo analysts have estimated",0.9442

3204,"The following says it all. More negative than you expect but that's reality of JNJ.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has certainly had easier times in terms of appeasing the market. The time-tested stalwart of many portfolios has had a bit of stagnation, and higher costs due in large part to legal costs related to lawsuits over its talc powder. The company also spent roughly $400 million in settlements related to Xarelto, a blood thinner. The problems created a quarter with decreases in earnings, but the company also had flat revenues.JNJ reported sales of $20.02 billion. Compared to 2018's $20.01 billion, it marks a 0.1% increase year over year. That's not exactly robust growth. On those sales, net earnings declined 14.2% to $3.75 billion. On a diluted basis, that breaks down to $1.39 per share. Compared to 2018's $1.60 per share, that's a 13.1% decline. On an adjusted basis, JNJ reported earnings of $5.66 billion, which represents a 0.5% increase year over year. That income represents adjusted earnings of $2.10 per diluted share, a 1.9% increase over last year's $2.06 per share.Johnson & Johnson doesn't give GAAP financial guidance due to too much uncertainty. On an adjusted basis it expects diluted earnings per share to increase 4.3#$%$ to $8.53-$8.63. It's relatively unchanged from the guidance provided in January. Analyst estimates seem to put full-year earnings in that range with $8.58 per share. If the company hits those levels, the stock is currently trading at roughly 16.22x forward earnings. That's not a bad valuation as long as the legal battles don't intensify.I do have concerns about how long lawsuits may last stemming from the problems surrounding baby talc powder.

His thesis is that JNJ will drop imetelstat because they didn't focus on imetelstat in the cc? Pretty flimsy Adam. JNJ definitely reaffirmed they would be making a decision whether or not to continue the collaboration by the end of the month. Obviously, yesterday wasn't the day for the announcement. JNJ did prominently identify imetelstat as a potential blockbuster drug to be filed for an NME application in the near term future for MF. Meanwhile they have surely enrolled numerous patients in phase 3 IMERGE who are chomping at the bit to start receiving imetelstat and even listed imetelstat for unapproved use as a compassionate use drug. Duh! That means one thing. ... it's working. I'm not too worried about AF's bearish opinion. His weakness is in predicting which drugs will or won't get approval. JNJ and/or FDA and/or EMA would have ended the trials by now if the drug was a dud. If JNJ were planning to drop imetelstat, they wouldn't have listed it in numerous slides, instead it would have been mysteriously, quietly missing. They certainly wouldn't have added a new indication. What wasn't said is that IMERGE is in fast track status. It's all about the results in the special expanded subset of E refractory, L & H naive, and non del 5q which are becoming clear by now. Good results here could mean advanced approval. I have a hunch the results are far better than just good.Remember, Unmet need, first and only in-class drug, huge platform potential and documented clinical remissions. Why would JNJ walk away from gross world wide sales to get out of paying 65 million? The only thing I can agree on with AF is that we will definitely know if he is right or wrong by the end of the month. Good luck longs! Go Imetelstat! : - D",0.992

Johnson & Johnson’s baby powder is safe and asbestos-free. Studies of more than 100,000 men and women show that talc does not cause cancer or asbestos-related disease. Thousands of independent tests by regulators and the world’s leading labs prove our baby powder has never contained asbestos. Johnson & Johnson will continue to defend the safety of our product.

We have also made our cosmetic talc mines and processed talc available to regulators for testing. Regulators have tested both, and they have always found our talc to be asbestos-free.The article ignores that J&J has always used the most advanced testing methods available to confirm that our cosmetic talc does not contain asbestos. Every method available to test J&J’s talc for asbestos has been used by J&J, regulators, or independent experts, and all of these methods have all found that our cosmetic talc is asbestos-free.",0.959

This compound represents a potential new treatment for thousands of patients suffering from ascites and other life-threatening complications of advanced liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis, NASH, and alcoholism. Sure this is a highly speculative stock. But the FDA has blessed it by assigning both orphan drug and FDA fast track status which in my opinion establish some reduce risk factor.

It did this through sham organizations like the ""Let's Talk Pain"" Coalition and websites such as ""PrescribeResponsibly.com"" that conceal the company's role, the lawsuit claimed. Its pamphlets falsely debunked so-called opioid myths by saying ""many studies show that opioids are rarely addictive when properly used for the management of chronic pain."" These claims had no scientific evidence to back them up, said Paul R. Rodriguez, acting director of the Division of Consumer Affairs. Four out of five heroin addicts started with prescription painkillers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.

3606,"At first glance, the results reported Friday from the long-awaited trial of Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine might have seemed disappointing. Its overall efficacy — the ability to prevent moderate and severe disease — was reported at 72% in the United States, 66% in Latin American countries and 57% in South Africa.Those figures appear far below the high bar set by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, the first two vaccines authorized for emergency use in the United States, which reported overall efficacy from 94% to 95%.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert and now the lead medical adviser to President Joe Biden on the coronavirus pandemic, acknowledged the striking difference at a briefing Friday.“If you woke up and you say, ‘Well, go to the door on the left and you get 94 or 95%, go to the door on the right and you get 72%,’ which door do you want to go to?” he asked.But Fauci said that the more crucial measure was the ability to prevent severe disease, which translates to keeping people out of the hospital and preventing deaths. And that result, for Johnson & Johnson, was 85% in all of the countries where it was tested, including South Africa, where a rapidly spreading variant of the virus had shown some ability to elude vaccines.More important than preventing “some aches and a sore throat,” Fauci said, is to fend off severe disease, especially in people with underlying conditions and in older adults, who are more likely to become seriously ill and to die from COVID-19.“If you can prevent severe disease in a high percentage of individuals, that will alleviate so much of the stress in human suffering and death in this epidemic that we’re seeing, particularly now,” Fauci said, “as we well know, over the last several weeks, our health care system has been stressed by the number of people that require hospitalization, as well as intensive care.”Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, compared the ability to prevent severe disease to the effects of flu shots, which do not always prevent influenza entirely but can make it less severe.“The same thing seems to be applying here, in a circumstance where this variant is clearly making it a little tougher to get the most vigorous response that you would want to have,” Collins said. “But still, for severe disease, it’s looking really good.”The Moderna vaccine also showed high efficacy, 100%, against severe disease. The Pfizer-BioNTech one appeared to as well, but the overall number of severe cases in the study was too small to be sure.But researchers warn that trying to compare effectiveness between new studies and earlier ones may be misleading, because the virus is evolving quickly and to some extent the trials have studied different pathogens.“You have to recognize that Pfizer and Moderna had an advantage,” Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, said. “They did their clinical trials before the variant strains became very apparent. Johnson & Johnson was testing its vaccine not only against the standard strain but they had the variants.”The best way to stop the spread of mutants and to prevent more new ones from emerging is to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible, Fauci and other researchers say. Viruses cannot mutate unless they are replicating, and they cannot replicate unless they can get into cells. Keeping them out by immunizing people can shut down the process.In addition to the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines already in use in the United States, three more may soon become available: those made by Novavax, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca’s vaccine has already been authorized in Britain and other countries.Globally, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is expected to play an important role, especially in low and middle-income countries, because it works after just one shot, is relatively inexpensive, and is easier to store and distribute than the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna because it does not share their stringent requirements for freezing and refrigerating.",0.9979

The JNJ vaccine is 72% effective at illness prevention with one shot - compared to ~50% for the first dose of the 2 shot options. JNJ reaches 100% effectiveness at hospitalization and death prevention after 28 days - compared to 45 days and requiring the 2nd shot for the 2 dose vaccines. Combine this with the fact that the one shot vaccine is easier to distribute, only requiring basic refrigeration and the fact that many people will not get the 2nd shot of the 2 dose options at all or in the right time period then the JNJ vaccine is arguably a superior vaccine option to control COVID more quickly and more completely than the 2 dose options.",0.9859

3756,"Johnson & Johnson Plunges Johnson & Johnson JNJ shares dropped the most in more than 15 years Friday following a Reuters report that said the company knew for decades that its iconic baby powder sometimes contained asbestos and failed to alert authorities. Johnson & Johnson reportedly knew both its raw talc and finished powder tested positive for traces of asbestos, a carcinogen, citing documents linked to a court case that saw a jury in Missouri award $4.7 billion to 22 women who said that the products contained asbestos and caused them to develop ovarian cancer. Reuters also said the company tried, unsuccessfully, to influence plans by U.S. regulators to reduce the amount of asbestos that could legally remain in some cosmetic talc products. ""The Reuters article is one-sided, false and inflammatory,"" Johnson & Johnson said in an emailed statement to TheStreet. ""Simply put, the Reuters story is an absurd conspiracy theory, in that it apparently has spanned over 40 years, orchestrated among generations of global regulators, the world's foremost scientists and universities, leading independent labs, and J&J employees themselves."" ""We note that all issues reported were previously disclosed as part of talc litigation discovery. As we think about the risk to JNJ here, we see today's move as an over-reaction, especially from a longer-term perspective,"" said JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott. ""At the same time, talc does not seem to be an issue that is going to resolve quickly for JNJ and we would expect shares to trade at a lower multiple pending further clarity on the company's exposure to this issue (which could be an extended period of time)."" Since the publication of the Reuters story, Johnson & Johnson lost all of the stock's year-to-date gains and wiped out $39.5 billion in market value, reported TheStreet's Martin Baccardax. When the market closed, the company was down over 10% to $132.86 a share.",0.9312

He sought more than $62 million in damages over his wife’s death. J&J denies its baby powder has ever been tainted with asbestos.“We look forward to a new trial to present our defense, which rests on decades of independent, non-litigation driven scientific evaluations, none of which have found that Johnson’s Baby Powder contains asbestos,” Kim Montagnino, a J&J spokeswoman, said in an emailed statement.The mistrial comes on the heels of a California jury’s decision Wednesday to reject a woman’s claims that asbestos-laced baby powder caused her mesothelioma. The panel found plaintiff Carla Allen was exposed to baby powder fouled by asbestos, but that wasn’t a “substantial factor” in causing her cancer.",-0.8585

If anything, NOT focusing on imetelstat today is a negative. https://t.co/UKOlyO799ETweet from Adam Feurstein This is the first time he put the possibility of being wrong into his equation. His thesis is that JNJ will drop imetelstat because they didn't focus on imetelstat in the cc? Pretty flimsy Adam. JNJ definitely reaffirmed they would be making a decision whether or not to continue the collaboration by the end of the month. Obviously, yesterday wasn't the day for the announcement. JNJ did prominently identify imetelstat as a potential blockbuster drug to be filed for an NME application in the near term future for MF. Meanwhile they have surely enrolled numerous patients in phase 3 IMERGE who are chomping at the bit to start receiving imetelstat and even listed imetelstat for unapproved use as a compassionate use drug. Duh! That means one thing. ... it's working. I'm not too worried about AF's bearish opinion. His weakness is in predicting which drugs will or won't get approval. JNJ and/or FDA and/or EMA would have ended the trials by now if the drug was a dud. If JNJ were planning to drop imetelstat, they wouldn't have listed it in numerous slides, instead it would have been mysteriously, quietly missing. They certainly wouldn't have added a new indication. What wasn't said is that IMERGE is in fast track status. It's all about the results in the special expanded subset of E refractory, L & H naive, and non del 5q which are becoming clear by now. Good results here could mean advanced approval. I have a hunch the results are far better than just good.Remember, Unmet need, first and only in-class drug, huge platform potential and documented clinical remissions. Why would JNJ walk away from gross world wide sales to get out of paying 65 million? The only thing I can agree on with AF is that we will definitely know if he is right or wrong by the end of the month. Good luck longs! Go Imetelstat! : - D",0.9907

4117,"Its Big Coronavirus Vaccine News?The clock is definitely ticking.Keith SpeightsKeith Speights(TMFFishBiz)Jan 26, 2021 at 6:09AMAuthor BioThe biggest healthcare company in the world has some really big news on the way. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) should announce results from a late-stage study of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, JNJ-78436735, any day now.What makes J&J's results so highly anticipated is that its vaccine requires only a single dose instead of two doses as coronavirus vaccines already on the market require. This could give J&J a significant competitive advantage over its rivals.With a potentially momentous announcement imminent, should you buy Johnson & Johnson stock before the big news hits? The answer is a little complicated.Hourglass next to a dollar signIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Playing devil's advocateLet's first make the case against buying shares of J&J. Probably the most compelling reason not to plunge in now is that there's a real possibility that the results for JNJ-78436735 might not be as good as hoped.J&J's COVID-19 vaccine candidate could prove to be both safe and effective in late-stage testing, yet still fail to impress investors. Pfizer and Moderna have set the efficacy bar very high. If the single-dose regimen of JNJ-78436735 doesn't at least deliver efficacy of 80% or higher, I suspect the vaccine could be seen as a disappointment.Keep in mind, also, that Johnson & Johnson has committed to selling JNJ-78436735 at cost during the pandemic. Even if the vaccine passes its late-stage testing with flying colors, it's going to be a while before J&J's bottom line receives a boost. J&J's sheer size also works against it. Successful late-stage results for a COVID-19 vaccine would provide a major catalyst for smaller biotech stocks. However, Johnson & Johnson generates more than $80 billion in annual revenue already. A new blockbuster product would be nice for the healthcare giant, but isn't likely to move the needle enough to cause its shares to skyrocket.The other side of the storySure, the late-stage results for JNJ-78436735 could be disappointing. However, there are reasons to expect good news. For example, J&J reported results from its phase 1/2a study that showed neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were produced in more than 90% of participants 29 days after receiving a single dose of the vaccine. A full 100% of participants between the ages of 18 and 55 had neutralizing antibodies at day 57. This bodes well for the prospects that JNJ-78436735 could achieve a high efficacy. I wouldn't be overly concerned about J&J's decision to not make a profit from its COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic, either. The company should have plenty of opportunities to generate significant profits over the long run from JNJ-78436735, especially if COVID-19 requires annual booster shots.But what about the argument that even positive results for JNJ-78436735 won't be enough to provide a solid catalyst for J&J's shares? My response is that it depends on the data. If J&J's vaccine has a high efficacy with a single dose, I wouldn't underestimate how excited investors could be on the news.A nuanced answerSo should you buy Johnson & Johnson stock before its big COVID vaccine news? I think the best answer to the question is a nuanced one.If you're looking for aggressive growth, J&J probably isn't going to be a great pick for you even if JNJ-7843673 is a rousing success story. However, if you're a more conservative investor, the stock could be quite attractive regardless of how good the late-stage results for J&J's COVID-19 vaccine are.",0.9996

Waiving IP protection for covid vaccines by the current US government administration is appalling. Instead of encouraging and protecting innovations, US government caters to the pressure from other countries by giving away patents registered by private companies. As more COVID variants and potential new future pandemics arise, who will invest and take risks to innovate without IP protection?Production of COVID vaccines is a complex scientific process and requires know-how, raw materials, strict quality controls. Waiving IP protections will not lead to increased production of vaccine doses. Without IP protection, on the contrary, it will make limited availability of raw materials scarcer to source; quality of vaccine doses will drop; counterfeits will rise.

In comparison, the stock closed Thursday's session at $131.75. RBC kept its investment rating on the stock at outperform. The firm said it sees Q3 results "" as a catalyst for the shares and would recommend adding to positions at current levels.""The price-target boost came as RBC also raised its estimates for Johnson & Johnson's Q3 revenue and earnings per share, as well as for its 2017 revenue and 2018 revenue and EPS, saying it believes the manufacturer of health-care products will report Q3 results ahead of consensus estimates. The firm now estimates Q3 worldwide revenue at $19.35 billion, up $160 million from its prior estimate, while it boosted its estimate for Q3 EPS to $1.79 from $1.75.RBC also sees an upward revision to 2017 guidance as likely. It expects Johnson & Johnson to reaffirm constant-currency revenue growth guidance of 5.5% to 6.0%, but also sees the company raising its guidance for reported revenue amid further weakening in the US dollar since Q2 results. For EPS guidance, RBC is predicting an increased range of $7.18 to $7.23 versus the current guidance for $7.12 to $7.22.The firm said it expects Johnson & Johnson's pharmaceutical segment to drive upside to current Street estimates for Q3 amid ""superior prescription trends for several large brands."" It noted its analysis of QuintilesIMS data shows prescription growth for most major brands accelerated in July and August.For the company's medical-devices and consumer segments, RBC expects ""modest"" organic revenue growth. In medical devices, the firm highlighted that ""a few businesses are doing well (e.g. electrophysiology, advanced surgery, vision care), a few are performing in line (e.g. orthopedics, excluding spine) and a few others are struggling (e.g. spine, specialty surgery)."" It noted recent hurricanes could also put negative pressure on the surgical franchises.In the consumer segment, RBC said beauty and over-the-counter products are the primary growth drivers, while the other product categories including baby care and oral care are under pressure, especially in the US. ""Management expects new products should lead to better performance in both segments, but the improvement may not be evident in 3Q,"" the firm said.",0.9979

Why does JNJ baby shampoo contain any chemical that customers ignore to buy?2- In medical devices, JNJ was ignorant too. Recently, a restaurant has started to use robots to cook hamburger.

This is software, electronic and hardware that is fast lane and almost things changes every 6 months to a year. Some medical devices require constant changes that don't match JNJ slow system since JNJ mentality is drug development that takes years but medical devices needs fast decisions and constant changes. No needs for paper pushers in this sector but constant designs and innovations with no restrictions. 3- In biotech, JNJ was acting so conservative that ABBV came and stole PCYC from hands of JNJHow many other opportunities were lost?",0.9864

Between its collection of three medicines for pulmonary hypertension and its six ongoing clinical trials to expand their indications, it's no surprise that the company's disease segment earned $2.6 billion in 2019 alone. Likewise, Johnson & Johnson's portfolio of four oncology drugs brought in 8.6% more revenue in 2019 than 2018 as a result of a number of growth-oriented clinical trials. Management is also skilled at getting its drugs approved in international markets. The company operates with equal proficiency in the U.S. and the E.U., and its sales in the Asia-Pacific region remain strong, growing by 4.9% last year. When paired with its aggressive indication-expanding trials, J&J's international expertise is a key component of its growth engine. It also helps the company to hedge against economic downside risk, as its geographical segments are unlikely to be contracting at the same rate at the same time.""",0.98

(BIVI), a clinical-stage company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative drug therapies for liver disease, announced today that it has achieved 50% enrollment of the patients in its open-label Phase 2a clinical study of BIV201 (continuous infusion terlipressin) for treating refractory ascites due to advanced liver cirrhosis.Penny Markham, PhD, BioVie Chief Scientist, stated, “The patients we are targeting for BIV201 therapy are desperately ill and experience a miserable quality of life. Absent liver transplantation, their outcomes are very poor. We are pleased to be working on developing a novel drug candidate that could potentially improve their future.”BioVie is conducting a mid-stage (Phase 2a) clinical trial of its Orphan Drug candidate, BIV201 (continuous infusion terlipressin), which has FDA Fast Track status and US patent protection. This compound represents a potential new treatment for thousands of patients suffering from ascites and other life-threatening complications of advanced liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis, NASH, and alcoholism. The initial disease target for BIV201 therapy is ascites, which is a serious complication of advanced liver cirrhosis. The FDA has never approved a drug specifically for treating ascites. The active agent in BIV201, terlipressin, is approved for use in about 40 countries for the treatment of related complications of advanced liver cirrhosis but is not available in the US or Japan.Undervalued at $0.03 per share.",0.9921

It only pulled it when the FDA confirmed that it contains asbestos. What a bad example of corporate ethics and behavior. This is perhaps the most evil corporation in the history of our country.

Let me know what you thinkLevaquin Users Sue J&J for $800M for Hiding Side EffectsBy Michelle LlamasThis page features3 Cited Research ArticlesLast modified: June 5, 2018Elderly man with chest pain and wifeFive former Levaquin users filed a lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson and its Janssen unit claiming the drug giant deliberately downplayed side effects of the medication to boost profits. The plaintiffs’ lawsuit said J&J mislabeled and misbranded the popular antibiotic, causing “significant harm and/or death to consumers of Levaquin, including plaintiffs.”In addition to J&J, the plaintiffs name additional defendants, including former FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg. The suit falls under the under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) act, the law used to prosecute organized crime. Plaintiffs seek more than $800 million, about $120 million in compensatory damages and around $750 million in punitive damages — damages meant to punish companies and discourage the same kind of behavior in the future, according to Fierce Pharma.The plaintiff’s attorney, Larry Klayman, argues that the defendants worked together to mislabel and misbrand Levaquin. Doctors use Levaquin and other drugs in the same class called fluoroquinolones to treat bacterial infections. They are popular because they treat a wide variety of illnesses from urinary tract to respiratory infections.In November 2015, the FDA’s Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee (ADMAC) and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee called for a black box warning, the agency’s strongest warning, for all fluoroquinolones.The class of drugs is linked to several disturbing side effects, including tendon damage, peripheral neuropathy, heart problems and skin conditions.“We … believe our actions regarding the medicine have been appropriate, responsible and in the best interests of patients,” J&J told FiercePharma in an email.Did you suffer side effects from antibiotics like Levaquin?",-0.9614

Azedra has been proven to save lives.PyL phase 3 for prostate cancer imaging is expected to start by end of 2018, based on PyL positive trial results, PGNX very optimistic opinion and the FDA fast concurrence & decision to move to phase 3.Data from compassionate use of I-131 1095 indicates it was well tolerated and demonstrated markedly reduced PSA levels and bone pain in a group of heavily-pretreated advanced prostate cancer patients following a single cycle of treatment. “We are pleased, following our discussions with FDA, to move this important therapeutic agent into a phase 2 study in combination with enzalutamide in chemo-naïve patients with mCRPC,” stated Vivien Wong, Ph.D., Executive Vice President Development at Progenics. “1095 delivers a targeted radiation dose to prostate cancer cells utilizing iodine-131 as the payload. Iodine 131 is an attractive agent to use because its physical properties of longer range and higher energy could potentially improve efficacy for bulky lesions and lesions that have lower PSMA expression. Iodine has been used widely in other cancer therapeutics, is broadly available with a ready supply and known safety profile. We look forward to evaluating the safety and efficacy of 1095 in this Phase 2 study.”",0.9955

Warren Buffett is too rich to own these stocks, but they are fine investments for smaller investors.Anders Bylund, Sean Williams, And Matthew DiLallo(TMFZahrim)Jul 11, 2017 at 8:47AMEnormous wealth has its downsides. Small investors like you and I can build game-changing wealth in stocks no billionaire would ever touch. We asked three Foolish investors to share some of the best names that Warren Buffett and George Soros wouldn't or simply couldn't trade. Read on to see how CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust(NYSE:CORR), Magic Software Enterprises(NASDAQ:MGIC), and Geron (NASDAQ:GERN) fit that bill.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The little software-building company that couldAnders Bylund (Magic Software Enterprises): You won't find a whole lot of interest in Magic Software Enterprises from deep-pocketed investors or the largest mutual fund managers. The company is simply too small and too thinly traded to move the needle for an investor with huge assets.To wit, the provider of software development and marketing solutions sports an average trading volume of less than 48,000 shares per day. Trading at roughly $8 per share, that works out to a daily dollar volume of roughly $385,000. That's small enough that individual investors can wield enough capital assets to account for more than 10% of the daily volume in a single trade. It's also small enough that a million-dollar buy or sale would soak up several days' worth of current orders, with market-moving results.Add in Magic Software's relatively small market cap of $360 million, and you'll have a complete set of big-money handcuffs. This is a thinly traded small cap, best left to smaller mutual funds or individual investors for the time being.Only 5% of Magic Software's shares are held by insiders and very large shareholders today. The largest mutual fund holding is a 0.7% stake held by the Westcore International Small Cap Fund, for a grand total of $2.1 million. The largest owner overall is a hedge fund called Denver Investment Advisors, whose entire asset base adds up to just $2.2 billion.Of course, none of this matters unless Magic Software qualifies as a stock worth investing in. In my view, it's at least worth a closer look by growth investors. The Israel-based company's shares are trading at a very reasonable 13 times forward earnings. Those earnings are expected to increase by 17% next year and an average of 14% over the next five years. Don't back up the truck to invest your life savings here, but Magic Software could be a quiet little winner over the next few years.This small-cap clinical-stage drug developer appears ripe for the picking Sean Williams (Geron): Clinical-stage biotech company Geron could be an intriguing stock for investors to consider, and it's certainly one that'll stay off the radars of billionaires.To begin with, it's a small-cap company with a $457 million market cap. Most billionaires prefer to buy larger companies and often view small caps as risky, volatile, and unproven. Second, Geron's share price is less than $3, which is a level often associated with risk and volatility. And finally, Geron is a wholly clinical-stage drug company, which means there's potential for wild share-price swings, and the need for investors to stay on top of clinical data. Most billionaires, including Buffett, simply don't have that kind of time to devote to keeping up with clinical trials.However, billionaires' loss can be your gain. Geron has but one compound in clinical development, imetelstat, as a treatment for myelofibrosis (MF) and myelodysplastic syndrome. But this one compound demonstrated jaw-dropping results in early stage clinical trials for myelofibrosis a few years back.Previous therapies targeted at MF have focused on the symptoms caused by the orphan disease, such as enlarged spleen and anemia, and done absolutely nothing to slow or halt disease progression. Imetelstat, however, demonstrated both partial and complete responses in MF patients, suggesting that it could become the standard of care in treating MF. The lone Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy on the market specifically for MF is Incyte's Jakafi, and it's on track to generate around $1.05 billion in sales this year at the midpoint. That $1.05 billion could almost entirely be imtelstat's if it excels in ongoing studies.Geron also isn't navigating the development of imetelstat alone. It's partnered with Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals. Geron and J&J worked out a deal worth as much as $935 million in 2014, which netted Geron $35 million upfront and gave it the opportunity to earn $900 million in various development and regulatory milestones. It's also entitled to a handsome royalty on net sales of imetelstat, if approved. Considering how versed J&J is in bringing new drugs to market, Geron may be able to sit on its laurels if imetelstat is approved, push its costs down substantially, and bank significant profits based on royalty revenue. It is also possible that J&J could just choose to acquire Geron if imetelstat is a success.Billionaires won't be going anywhere near Geron, but it could be ripe for the picking for biotech-savvy, patient investors.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.An income growth stock you won't want to missMatt DiLallo (CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust): Billionaire investors tend to avoid smaller stocks because they'd need to buy an outsized stake in the company for it to make a meaningful difference in their portfolio, which alone could move the stock. Because of that, most uber-wealthy investors would likely avoid buying CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, as its current market cap is less than $400 million.However, just because most billionaires wouldn't bother with CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust doesn't mean you should avoid this high-yielding energy-focused REIT. That's because the company offers investors an eye-popping yield of nearly 9%, with plenty of upside potential as it buys additional assets.Supporting that payout is a growing portfolio of mission-critical infrastructure properties that it leases to customers under long-term agreements, which provide the company with stable cash flow. While the company endured a period of uncertainty during the oil market downturn after two large customers went through bankruptcy proceedings, CorEnergy's leases survived untouched.Adding further stability to its payout is the company's conservative payout ratio, which has averaged around 75% of its adjusted funds from operations over the past year. Finally, CorEnergy has an excellent balance sheet, evidence by a low debt-to-capitalization ratio of 24%, which is below its 25% to 50% target.Because of its healthy dividend coverage and ample financial flexibility, CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust has the capacity to make a couple of acquisitions per year going forward, targeting deals in the $50 million to $250 million range. Given its small size, these deals could be needle-moving, potentially providing the company with the ability to grow its already generous payout at a brisk pace. That combination of income with upside makes CorEnergy a compelling stock to consider, even if it's too small for most billionaires.Anders Bylund has no position in any stocks mentioned. Matt DiLallo owns shares of CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust and Johnson & Johnson. Sean Williams has no position in any stocks mentioned.
