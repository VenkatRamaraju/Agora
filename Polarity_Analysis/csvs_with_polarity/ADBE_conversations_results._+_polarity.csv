103,"How much will ADBE fall tomorrow? My suggestion if management is smart enough to really think. I almost bought a new MacBook air pro but held off only to get pro logic to make music. What Adobe needs and must do Is make a tad simpler version like logic but with all new different sounds from Adobe. All the students at college think and say the same thing in my film classes, digital media courses, audio courses and in my coding software class. Adobe does not understand how much business in new student 20.00 subscription fees this would bring, plus students are dumping mac airs and going to newer lighter notebooks from msft. Can you imagine if Adobe big wig picked up the phone and called msft big wig, ...Let's both put money into this special collaboration project with a team of 40 of our guys and 40 of yours for 6 months to make our way better version of logic we will call Adosoft audio or Adobesoft. audition. Why because it will sell more new Microsoft laptops chosen over apple macbooks. That helps msft get buyers that feel forced to logic and final cut pro from mac. Two it helps adobe as the latest and greatest new app software out to make music. Adobe new high school and college subscriptions would skyrocket. Students talk and the new conversation for people making their own original songs would go from I'm buying the mac for logic and pro to. Forget those programs and the mac, Adobe teamed up the last six months with msft and completed a secret project called Adobesoft audition audio. It has 4 times the new choices as logic aapl takes their sweet time for a major update so they lost their old number 1 logic spot for good in six months from Adobe msft collaboration. Now the final way adobe sells more laptops for msft and msft who helped speed up what would have taken adbe a year in a half by themselves. So you go to the msft store, for 12 months they include the new adobe audition. Subscriptions and laptop sales skyrocket. Want to know the best part? All those new laptop buyers are learning adobe opposed to mac. Students don't like to learn the same thing twice. Regular business pro's that like microsofts new lighter long lasting battery life learned adobe audio and video editing instead of mac software. Now Adobe if msft says no, you call oracle, and go down the line not stopping until you are having a teleconference meeting with software engineers and musicians telling you what they like and how to make it simpler for them. Get everybody on the same page about the 6-8 month timeframe. Your jumping way out ahead of apple. Pass them while they are focused on apple tv and arcade with google arcade also on their heels. Print this out Adobe audition executive, take it to the boardroom and make it happen.Unleash the monster this stock could be again if you follow the steps exactly like this student wrote for your company for free. I cannot buy adbe stock till you do this. I'm in Nio before earnings Tuesday, bynd before my psychic abilities see a mcdonalds deal, roku because arms dealers always win and MAXR because the chart screams a short squeeze pop market maker induced right away to 15 before 21 a couple days later.",0.9994

Buying PUTs on $FB, $AAPL, $ADBE, $NVDA, $BOOM, $IBKR, $MU, $GOOS, $NTNX, $AAOI, $TGTMost likely, Putin will not expose his puppet tomorrow. Why do that, when he can be used to sow so much more discord in the Western World, while Putin strengthens Russia and its allies' positions? But blowing the Manchurian candidate's cover tomorrow would be like dropping a nuke on Democracy and would throw everything into disarray, because he would expose not only Trump but hundreds of our politicians as traitors. It could take years or decades to recover, if we ever do. This is much worse than Watergate.Anyway, I think that ""nothing"" will happen tomorrow. Trump will probably achieve ""success"" at the summit, which will help get more Republicans into office in a few months, giving him yet more power to destroy the institutions of Western Democracy. Putin and maybe China too are probably encouraging Kim and Trump (their puppets).So, all these PUTs will probably expire worthless.

That said, the one real eye opener was when Goldman Sachs and UBS engaged in lengthy suits and countersuits for the theft of proprietry ""trade secrets"" and the theft of key programmers for their teams. It turns out that the 2 people in question were leading edge programmers that had come across a genetic algorithym capable of detecting earnings results before they actually came out - and they made billions. Now days literally dozens of research teams across the industry employ quant analyisis utilizing the latest in AI (genetic algorithms) to detect moves before they happen. Know this to be true (and it is), there is no way in hell I am going to go against UBS when 4 days before ADBE is set to reveal their 1st quarter numbers come out with an upgrade on ADBE and raise their target price by some 25%, We will all know for sure by late Thursday but I'll tell you one thing; there is no way in the world I would bet against that UBS prediciton.

Somehow Adobe has reduced costs significantly, and this savings extended from Q4 of 2020 to Q1 of 2021. Will this continue?Given the positive guidance for 2021, it looks as though it might. At least, it seems credible that their forward guidance is at least accurate.I'd be interested in learning what they did to reduce costs $1 Billion per quarter and if this will be sustained. If this is because they furlowed employees due to Covid, then we might presume that these costs will return for the rest of the year as they bring people back on board.

At that time, cost were a mere fraction of revenues and we receives a small but fair dividend. In 2005 they gave us a 2 for 1 split and ceased the dividend. I was not unhappy because this was supposed to offer greater growth and benefit to us. After years and years of up and down and frustration, it did in deed take off. My only concern is that I am now in retirement and all I hear about this companies operations is how well they treat their employees. Free health care, child care, cafeterias, workout rooms, sponsored vacations, time off for pregnancies and after delivery, newer and more expensive buildings, free free free. When it was announced that they would receive around 600 million in offshore income at lower tax rates, the CEO said that a lot of that would go to the share holders, either in a dividend or a stock buy back. A mere 8 million allocated to SBB, #$%$. I believe that the stock holders should demand a dividend, equivalent to the same percentage of all paid benefits to average earnings of all non exec employees. I also don't understand the soon to be billion dollars a year in R and D when almost all of their advances are from purchasing other concerns. I am still not unhappy with Adobe, it bought my retirement home, but I feel it is time they start thinking about their shareholders, as well as their employees.",0.9974

Toxic environment inside the teams.Hopefully it hits 500, so I will sell all and never look back. I will not care if it later hits 700, 800, etc.",-0.7754
