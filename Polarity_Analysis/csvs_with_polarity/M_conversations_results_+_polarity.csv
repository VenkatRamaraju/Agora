6,"John Templeton did not believe in Efficient Markets theory nor did any successful money manager.John Templeton said in order to beat the market you must purchase what others are avoiding!Buy the diamond in the rough before others find it. He would buy companies in temporary problems that had the potential for greatness, and he would buy them before others saw the light at the end of the tunnel.Case in point is his purchase of Union Carbide right after a major chemical spill in India that killed thousands and injured 500,000. Most money managers sold! He bought! It was one of his most profitable purchases ever!To do better than others you have to buy what they arent buying. IF you only buy the popular stocks that everyone else buys like MSFT, Amazon etc. you wont achieve superior performance in your portfolio management. A word to the wise.",0.9883

Macy’s is expected to report an adjusted loss per share of $2.53 on $3.69 billion in revenue during its first quarter.A few weeks ago, Macy’s provided preliminary first quarter financial results. “The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted our first quarter sales and earnings results, but I am proud of the way our team navigated this difficult period and maintained the business while our stores were closed,” CEO Jeff Gennette said in a statement.“Our strong digital business sales trend continued throughout May, and it is encouraging to see that as we reopen a store, the digital business in that geography continues to be strong. By June 1, we had approximately 450 stores reopened, with the majority opened in their full format. Our reopened stores are performing better than anticipated. Importantly, we are receiving positive feedback on the curbside pickup experience and our efforts to create a safe and welcoming shopping environment,” he added.The company also said that it was seeing strong sell-through of its seasonal merchandise and expects to exit the second quarter in a clean inventory position.Department stores had been struggling even before COVID-19 wreaked havoc on the retail industry.

These are facts and figures, they are based in reality, they are not some arbitrary declaration that ""this stock should be x amount of dollars based on nothing"".Debt ratios, Forward P/E's, sales growth, profit margins, growth rate of EPS.. these things matter much more than what someone decides is a nice looking number.

Their game is to buy lo lo lo thus relentless bashing to drive the s/p down, then sit chilly until a profit is realized & sell sell sell. This strategy is to accumulate a larger cache of shares, enough to drop the s/p when they are ready to sell, accumulation of 100's of thousands of shares is the goal so they have the power to rinse & repeat. They want your shares on the cheap & will say anything to sway your opinion & emotions. Take note of who these players are so you can evaluate their post with a grain of salt. They seem to be real good at predicting when the s/p is going to drop, but disappear when s.p is going up. They will be here this weekend trying to convince you this stock is worthless, be smart & ignore their post or mute them.

194,"Fed operations have begun a process that is now, and will continue to strengthen the dollar. This has profound effects on stock classes going forward. High PE growth is slowing and those stocks began to come under pressure in September. There is a stock rotation under way that is shifting from growth to ""value"" type stocks. Among the ""winners"" for this next phase are good earners, not small earners or growth that has not yet turned the corner.Large, companies with good balance sheets, consistent earnings, high dividend payments and many of the characteristics exhibited by Macy's are coming into favor, at a remarkable time in which certain cyclical trends have driven M to multi year PPS lows. There are many ways to look at the risks and rewards in holding M for the upcoming rotation. Certainly high yield will be a great driver if the dividend is safe. As this becomes more clear, M can double on yield alone. If the payout continues, the PPS must adjust to around a 5%yield, IMO, and if M drives annual EPS back to the $4/share range, it will more than double.So do the work to see how they can, and likely will, drive EPS above $4/share in this coming ""value"" environment.They have debt reduction, cost reduction, asset sales and other balance sheet tactics in play. They have spelled it all out. Just read what they are planning to do to reduce debt and costs.The second leg of their plan is a large number of initiatives that can grow sales and margins. These also have been spelled, and they appear to be good plans that are more or less doable, including key store improvements.There is always risk and more than one outcome possible, but now the odds favor M, far more than at any time in the last few years, while sentiment is down, manipulation attempts are rampant, and the market is in a fear phase.

Eventually, most of what is purchased is night clothes as they become bed-ridden except for trips to the doctor.This age bracket buys even less in the way of home furnishings.

Frequently we are trying to get rid of accumulated stuff instead of adding to the collection.Generations behind us are smaller.

Absolutely Wrong! You know why they say that, it is because they heavily own Amazon and other ONLINE retailers. Fact is that 75% of all clothing sales are at brick and mortar stores such as Macys. The latest government sales figures showed a massive drop in clothing sales corresponding to the time Macys and other retailers were forced to close their stores. Clearly what the consumer did was to say, well Macys is closed, so I will delay clothing sales until they reopen.So Amazon, Walmart or Target did not get those sales. The consumer merely delayed and stopped purchasing clothing during that time. Fact is 75% of clothing sales are at brick and mortar stores and these consumers WILL NOT BUY CLOTHES ONLINE! This is true mote protecting sales at Macys because the consumer will not buy ONLINE!This a mote, which Amazon cannot overcome unless it were to purchase a huge department store chain like Macys!It is the only way as online sales of clothing will never exceed 25 percent annually.Thus I fully expect a V shaped recovery in sales to Macys and Kohls. As the CEO of Macys said, he sees $10 billion is sales additionally up for grabs because of the massive bankruptcies in the USA of retailers like JCPENNY, Neiman Marcus, JCCREW etc.Macys and Kohls will benefit and be more profitable and stronger after all this nonsense subsides.I see huge gains in the stock prices going forward!",0.9887

And so using data and customer analytics, we can become more precise on who we target with promotions and what offers we provide,"" Price said.Macy's, the largest U.S. department store chain, has closed more than 100 stores and cut thousands of jobs as mall traffic falls amid a shift in customer preference to shop online.The company said it is also testing self checkout in stores and rolling out new modernized handheld devices for staff to improve efficiency.The retailer also said it expects to drive about $100 million in additional working capital improvements.Earlier this year, Macy's said it would cut 100 senior management positions to reduce costs and improve profitability.

To answer this, do your own homework, look at retail data, look at what markets Macy's serves, look at their balance sheet, online sales, debt, access to cash and so on. Also, in addition to your own homework, find out what reputable analysts are saying about Macy's. If you're truly convinced death of Macy's is on the horizon, the short the stock and shut up about it. If you're convinced that Macy's online sales are growing, that Macy's serves a much needed market between fancy boutiques and Target quality, which I believe, and that Macy's will survive, then buy as much as you can, either shares or very long term contracts, and then ignore all negativity about this stock. Remember, companies do not go bankrupt because their stock is low. Just consider Sunpower. A few months ago, they hit 3 dollars. Now, it's trading above 17! It is only a matter of time before Macy's will pull through this rut, and believe you me, it takes just a few steps to jump from 6ish to 8 to 10, then it will be matter time before it goes back to upper teens and before you know it, in 20s.

Her bosses say that's where the money is. Old people read newspapers and young people go online (digital) and read. if at all. I can't see digital is the answer for M or online. Amazon and Wal-Mart are years and millions ahead. Although the previous M CEO was ahead of his time with store closings and investing in online sales. What should M's foot print be in five years? 500 or 600 stores? Is stand alone smaller stores the answer? I don't think so. JCP sold real estate to stay afloat and sold bonds for years. In 2012 I bought JCP and by 2013 I knew they'd be bankrupt.

Though it fell at a more moderate rate than its fall in prior years, we note that this decline occurred despite an excellent consumer-spending environment and Macy’s best comp sales result in four years.Based on our analysis and incorporating management guidance, we expect core retail operating profit to decline in 2019, as well.",0.9817

Its obvious that M is unlikely to cut their dividend by their forecast and recent commentary, however why haven't they declared the dividend yet? If they were going to cut that most likely would have been announced along side earnings which they haven't. That being said nobody knows what's going on w dividends yet but what i do know is that M pays 465M a year in dividends, that's alot considering the marketcap is near 4B. M can literally buyback 11% of the shares at current prices with just the dividend they payout in a year which is after tax earnings. This would immediately change the forward estimated eps from 2.40 to about 2.80 a share. Oh but what there's something else... the 34M shares that were eliminated would also potentially yield a savings of 51M a year if M decides to reinstate the dividend the following year. This use of funds from dividend will do nothing to Macy's core business and is totally optional. Those that argue this would decimate M stock obviously haven't been paying attention when M went from 42 down to 13.5! It has already been decimated (unjustly) by the market so a surprise move by management like this would definitely rattle the nearly 30% short positions that are definitely impacting share prices.

748,"E, actually it is a great buy given the manipulated and controlled markets we now find ourselves in and actually have been in for over a year. We hear that there are concerns about the economy, yet we have retailers posting very good numbers. We get Kohl's, Gap, ANF, Target, BBY, Wal-mart and many others jump anywhere from 5 to 30% after reporting. And yes we do have the laggards as well, JWN, though they are flirting with 52 week lows are still a distance away and offer a dividend which is half of Macy's. We supposedly have government numbers which came out extremely close to the time that the government shutdown was resolved for December retail numbers which according to the government were horrible, yet this seems to run counter to what Visa and Mastercard were saying and is being confirmed by dozens of retailers who posted good if not great numbers. So what we will probably see is that the government retail numbers which was created by a group of disgruntled typically liberal civil servants who were peeved at the President whom they blame for the shutdown, when the new numbers come out for January and February we shall see large upward revisions to these numbers and this should shut down the false narratives about the American consumer being weak. We are already at 52 week lows and we seem to reach new depths every week, yet even though many will disagree, the earnings report by Macy's was not a bad report, was it a bit disappointing, sure, though we do know that there were significant issues created by the fire at their primary on-line sales distribution center. So add into the equation again a dividend which can compete with most REITs you have a stock already at multi-year lows (last time at this level was Nov. 2017 and before that it was 2009), so you really have very limited downside.

751,"Greetings from the Czech Republic. In our country, we have followed the restrictions since the first case appeared in our country. Started wearing face masks, social distancing, quarantine, lockdowns, etc. Since this day we have had 8.900 cases and 315 deaths (population around 10 mil.). Monday 25th May we are reopening almost everything. Big shopping malls are already opened, except fast foods since half of May. 14 days ago there were no people shopping. Yesterday we went for shopping again and crowds are almost back to normal 70-80% I would say. During March and April online shopping has skyrocketed (especially older people) in our country, but after reopening people are getting back to standards. I must admit, that some people will never get back because of online, so Macy's will definetely lose some customers. On the other hand, customers from JCP and other devastated companies will come. According to my humble opinion COVID just accelerates a digital evolution. If Macy's survives this COVID thing, they should invest more to online. We will probably see more and more closed mall in near future, not because of COVID, but online. Macy's is a valuable company trading under its book value.

755,"A fair assessment of the pluses and minuses of buying M here at close to $14 per share with a very high 10% dividend (that has been manufactured by shorts and other forces which have temporarily driven the PPS down sharply from $42/share), can only be made by those with knowledge and, is really, a research project for interested parties, followed by a careful evaluation, and ultimately leads to disparate opinions. I have done my due diligence and conclude that M is way underpriced right now when compared to its intrinsic value.Properly done, you must make many comparisons between how the retailer department stores are doing in sales, earnings, margins and other metrics, and how it is thought they will do in the future. They are obviously in a competitive battle for market share and also for best practices in this age of e-commerce.Some of M’s strengths appear in the metrics found in their balance sheet items like cash, debt, real estate assets, and many other factors, all of which have to be weighed and carefully evaluated. However, even the quick passing view shows M has enormous staying power and that they are outlasting department stores of lesser stature. When you are all done with the numbers you need also to keep looking at many other factors, including the stock market prospects, the retail industry prospects, the individual company's management, dividends and the ability to pay them, buy backs, and on and on. I have tried to assess all these factors, and IMHO, M is temporarily extremely depressed and has an absolutely great comparative value at these prices, which have now become incredibly oversold given their opportunity versus their current risk. No one can argue about the opportunity, as you need look no further than last year when profits were over $4/share and the PPS was $42. What has caused the sudden sell down is the dropping profits to $3/share, which in and of itself is overdone, IMO.With a reasonably strong economy, despite the fear that it might be slowing in the coming year, but still growing, and the other positive factors favoring discretionary spending by consumers, retailers stand in a good position now. During the next 12 months, we will see how M's multifaceted initatives work out to cut costs, increase productivity, improve their use of data and better manage inventory. Their plan and goal is to produce outsized improvements in quarterly and annual comparisons. I think they are bound and certain to achieve some or all of their objectives because their efforts are well conceived, and for may reasons, profits will grow from the low point they hit in their last quarter.To me, the time is right to buy and hold M, and it is my view that it has an excellent, logically sound, and evidence base reasons for an eventual return to $70/ share. Lower PPS numbers like $40/share and $30/share are even more likely. When it comes to high probability plays, I think it is reasonable to expect we will see the markets swing and take M back on good news way above $20. now, I like the “value play” of a solid company, with sales increases, and expected annual earnings of approximately $3/share priced, at a 5 PEs. I think PE expansion is coming and so is profit expansion. No one should ignore the value of their real estate holdings as you figure out their enterprise and market value.",0.9991

That way the brokerage houses that you work for can come in and buy more stocks from the concerned small investors. The truth is that without knowing what the true churn rate is, we as individual investors can't really have confidence that any movement is anything more than manipulation using HFT computers. Yes, ten million shares may trade today, but really, how many times where the same shares traded back and forth to the same buyers and sellers to create a false narrative? What if Morgan Stanley and Goldman decided to trade the same block of 100K shares back and forth one hundred times at progressively lower prices, how likely is it that someone would have the capital available to intercept the trade and cause them to real lose any money on the transactions as they are just selling back and forth.

They own their entire supply chain and come out with new seasons of fashion with low inventories, use the provided inventories as a gauge of the consumers interest, if it is great response they can mass produce the product in a matter of days and flood the shelves, if it is failure they use consumer surveys and data collection systems to re-align the designs which they can do in a matter of two weeks, if those designs work as anticipated and shown through the low initial inventory levels they again, flood the shelves, if not, back to the drawing boards.

780,"Should I say I told you so? Target just released their holiday sales figures and they were disappointing. Why? Because they COMPETE head on with Walmart and NOT MACYS! Walmart and Target are primarily grocery stores with about 60 percent of all revenue from groceries. Revenue thus is fairly consistent, but boring and very low margin as they make very little profit for each dollar of sales. Half of their store footage is occupied with groceries which MACYS does not sell at all. The other half of the store sell an assortment of products that Macys does not sell either such as Tires, Car Batteries, and neither does Macys change your oil so Macys does not have a service department for cars or sell car accessories. Target competes viciously with Walmart, Costco and Sams Club. Target sells the same things as Walmart but its prices are higher than Walmart. Likewise Walmart and Target being grocery stores compete with Albertsons, Krogers etc.. in this very low profit margin business.For the very little foot space left in Walmart and Target they sell a few clothing items for men and women and children as well as shoes and I might add they sell LOW QUALITY cheap clothing such as mostly jeans and tee shirts as well as some very low quality exercise clothes. The clothes that Walmart and Target sell are of such low quality and of very poor selection because they don't have any floor space left to provide a wide selection of clothes like MACYS. Thus Target competes with Walmart and they try to steal sales from each other, but however they don't sell the same items that Macys sells.Macys is a HIGH END retailer selling high quality clothes with an excellent selection, shoes and numerous other items like fine furniture too. You Can go to Target and Walmart and buy the same items you can buy at Macys.Macys also sells unique high quality clothes, shies and furniture lines not available at any other store. Macys also has unbeatable prices too. This is why Macys is doing so well and will post surprising sales and earnings figures soon.They have a terrific 3 year growth plan to be released Feb 5 th that will send shares upward.

It is true that this year their profit and margins came under some pressure, but they have the tools to manage the issues and the Administration will probably work out something with China that will lessen the tariff part of the problem for M. Retail, especially department stores, are undergoing some changes, but a 5 PE is just way too low to reflect the value of a large company that consistently generates $3 to $4 per share every year since 2013 (look at their profit history) and pays a good dividend to its stockholders. The S&P 500 average PE is around 18 and yet, M with $25 B in sales and an expected profit of around $3 per share gets no respect. At a mere 10 PE the current PPS would be about $30 where it still would be undervalued. If they turn things around and show EPS growth and improved margins, they could support a 12 to 15 PE IMO which would triple current PPS metrics. In 2018 they generated $4/share with higher debt costs. Clearly they could get back to those numbers with lower debt costs and all their technology ideas they are working on. At $4/share and 12 PE, they could return to a PPS of near $50/share, which no doubt is their working goal. Those with vision that buy stock here may be richly rewarded, IMO.

All of the retailers have their own strengths and cover a wide and diverse market of shoppers nation-wide.2) Real estate holdings are worth between $16 and 20 BILLION dollars. And have been monetized quite well in 2017, whether selling properties or leasing space, to high-end shops, on or near its flagship stores.3) It generated $170 million in profit from its store credit cards alone in 2017. 5) Still paying a generous 5.5% dividend (even more if you got in last year). And there is no sign that they are going to reduce it anytime soon.6) Weaker dollar brings more foreign shoppers to retailers like Macy. Amazon can't and doesn't benefit from it as much. I'm not going to knock Amazon, they will always be dominant, but saying it's the death of retail is like saying Netflix is the death of the the Movie industry. Both can and will co-exist with each other.7) That which does not kill you, only makes you stronger. Sears, JCP, & Bon-Ton, large closings and bankruptcies may sting M in the short run, but in the long run reduced competition will bring more customers to Macy's and their other stores.Once we hit $30, FOMO will kick in again driving the stock to new highs.

The firm entered May with $1.52 billion in cash and total debt of $5.66 billion and is trying to raise additional capital.

If they can afford to do some share buy backs, they also will reduce dividend costs. They are working on a cost reduction play which likely will close weak stores and reduce employee counts.The cumulative effects of cost reduction s is going to bring much higher margins and profits. When the market sees the PPS start going up, it will reward M by extending it's PE, at least back to 10, on, hopefully, $4/share profits.

That outperformance is remarkable because it flies in the face of Goldman Sachs downgrading the stock to Sell from Neutral and slashing its price target to $12 from $17.Strikingly, Macy's has already exceeded its average daily volume less than two hours into the trading session. That heavy volume and the positive turn in the stock on a seemingly negative development are likely byproducts of the following factors:Investor belief that the Goldman Sachs analyst isn't breaking any new ground with the basis for the downgrade (secular headwinds weighing on comps and profitability). Shares of M were down 49% for the year before today's downgrade.Short-covering activity, which is often triggered when a beaten-up stock makes a counter-intuitive move.Momentum trading as speculators see an opportunity to force a short squeeze.Macy's is the picture of a tax-loss selling candidate, but the flip side of that understanding is that many tax-loss selling candidates are seen as good, bargain-hunting opportunities after the tax-loss selling is complete. The stock's resilience to selling interest today is apt to be helping its candidacy as a short-term, speculative rebound play.",0.9662

Could have slowed down a bit so management could better focus on the core business more effectively and used half that capex to continue and pay sown debt. I mean over 3B within 3 years is alot. I'd be okay seeing about 75 growth stores done and 100+ Backstages completed for 1.5B. The other 1.5B could have dropped the debt level down near the 3B mark currently and theit EBITDA would now be in the 2.5-2.9 ratio WITHOUT asset sales therefore any future proceeds could be used to immediately buyback shares within the company's own guidelines. But o well, if Macy's doesn't have a blowout Christmas and a beat they better not keep dumping into Capex bc as an investor i would bail, bc 3B and 200+ backstage and 150 growth us enough to show sizable progress and if it does not it probably means it's not working and they should immediately continue to focus on debt reduction and perhaps some share repurchases. If they do that atleast M has a shot to be debt free within a reasonable few more years before things really fall off the cliff. Then atleast shareholders would be left with a company with massive real estate holdings and virtually no debt. Pretty sure shareholders okay with that. And even if M will eventually make less profit i don't see it taking losses anytime soon and they could also cut the nearly 500M dividend to 0 and get that debt paid off.

We'd be looking at a while different share price today even if sales were to slump a bit more. I don't understand why management rushed to do over 3B in upgrades and capex with so little to show for the results. 1.5B would have been enough to see if there was real results amd continue on a multi year capex instead of a 3 year binge in lieu of holding more cash on hand to tackle debt and buying shares back when jts cheap and yielding over 10%! That being said, with over growth stores and over 200 Backstages i really hope management will relax the capex and use any profits to continue to pay down debt and buying some shares back.

When he took over the past CEO recklessly had borrowed over $7 billon in long term bonds to finance an huge stock buy back that caused the stock to soar to around $70/share in the short term but he neglected its CAPEX and stores in general and Macys then was in decline under him, with newly minted heavy debt and sales declines accelerated and the credit agencies downgraded Macys several times due to the crisis that this reckless CEO caused. The new CEO immediately ended the stock buy back plan, and diverted free cash flow to pay off this long term debt and now long term debt is down to only $4 billion and falling quickly. In a few years all the long term debt will be paid off at this rate.Also, the current CEO dramatically upgraded Macys stores, improving sales, merchandise, marketing and he successfully stopped the decline in sales and even for many quarters we saw an increase in sales per store. AS a result of paying off debt and taking a serious stand against debt and stabilizing the sales and increasing net earnings the credit agencies took Macys off the negative credit watch and Macys debt remains investment grade today. I expect Macys will likely see their debt upgraded by the credit agencies if this CEO continues to pay off debt this fast and continues to improve the Macys business.This quarter sales and earnings are going to be much better than expected and combined with the soon to be released 3 year growth plan by this new CEO soon to be released on Feb 5th I expect a huge jump in this stock.

Ross debt to equity ratio 1.77. Macy debt to equity ratio 2.28. Ross retain earnings about 2.3billion. Macy retain earning is 7 billion. Ross has growing fcf that pass 1.5 billion while macy fcf is around 500mil- 1billion. Macy current prob is that it not growing it earning has more debt to equity that they are currently trying to fix which they have been paying down alot the past few years. It selling/ admin expense is over 90% it should try lower it to 40-30% since it about 2x higher than it competitor. In the end the macy and rost has different comparison.

(My wife is a true blue on-line Macy's customer - she believes they ship faster, have better goods and do a much better job than Amazon or Nordstrom) She said to me, without any inducement, thatNordstrom used to be the store to beat when it came to customer service — Macy's has done exactly that. Their people are more responsive, their products are displayed and described more accurately; (My wife has returned two or three Nordstom on-line items...but never returned any of her Macy's on-line purchases). I don't want this to sound like a big ad for Macy's. I like the company, yes. I think it's earnings were terrific and the sell off today was mostly emotional — not fundamental.

Russia announced their success and plans to innoculate their whole population starting in october thus ending covid in Russia.The USA is second or third in the world behind Russia and China and soon will do the same.Covid again, people forget, is just a mild flu virus that is so mild most Americans get it and don't know they have it because they have no symptoms at all.Its so harmless to most Americans, that it is far widely spread than most realize. In fact as much as 80 million Americans can now have had it and have immunity without knowing it. Antibody tests recently done by several Universities prove that the general population has been vastly exposed to it already and have immunity. In Los Angeles alone the positive tested cases vastly underestimate how widely it has spread.They estimate 20 to 40 times as many people as tested positive actually have had it in Los AngelesThis means in the USA about 5 million tested positive, but the actual number in the USA who have had it and have immunity now is more like 100 million people.Fact is ONLY a tiny portion of the USA population suffer severe symptoms and serious ill effects of the virus.Most of us, who are healthy and strong otherwise have no fear of covid. Its really the most mild flu ever.Case in point: Jack Nickolaus and his wife both in their 80s admitted they both had covid 19 and his wife totally had no symptoms at all. Jack had a mild cold for a few days and that was all and it went away on its own. If an 80 year old couple had such an experience like this we see clearly covid is indeed such a mild fluthat all this closing down of the economy, trillion dollar Hero bills from Congress and mass forciing of businesses to close and go out of business and 54 million unemployed was certainly very judgement on the part of our government.I think we need to vote them out of office.

Apparently Macys sold a building and the top floors of that Macys to the real estate company who built it for 256 million. I would guess that the same would apply to Herald Square. Macys would sell the top of that building and the rights to build there. What kind of price do you think that would fetch? It could approach $1B.

Depending on expected EBITDA trends Macys would appear to be a better buyout potentially at current levels.

Meanwhile we see retailers who posted very good numbers like ANF who go up two dollars in a matter of three days to only go back up 3 dollars over four days, all on no news and it just bounces back and forth with out any logic or reason. It is happening throughout the markets, look at Five Below, after posting their stock tanked in pre-markets, continued down at the open but finished up over six dollars. Today we have Constellation Brands, post good numbers and they go up in pre-market though all over the place, they actually drop a couple of bucks at open and now are up almost ten dollars but have been up as much as 12 dollars today. Tell me, why such wild and illogical movements and please spare me the usual algorithms which are just reacting to certain key words or phrases. If that were the case, the stocks would either rocket up or down without the ridiculous inflection points. These inflection points are meant to trigger sell orders so that the big money boys can catch the passive funds, the small retail investors off guard and then profit as they run up the prices, sure it is computerized trading, but it is coordinated computerized trading accomplished by collusion (and not by the Russians or the Trump campaign).

Personally, I am happy they eliminated Good Will from the books. I never like balance sheets that Good Will on them.

1638,"The recent sell off over the last few days hit all the department stores, not just Macy's. It was caused, IMO, by the advanced retail report for August that estimated that retail sales were up month over month and year over year, with e-commerce up 16% while department store sales were lagging for that partial month. The drop in M stock was another over-reaction by the market, and the shorts, as M's is certainly not a pure department store play with no e-commerce component. Indeed, M's is working hard to make that key adjustment to use its stores in combination with its e-commerce strengths for advantage, and they have over 40 quarters of improving e-commerce sales, which already is representing over 10% of their sales. The August retail report contains some very positive data for retail overall as it is growing at a reasonably healthy pace, which bodes well for all retail sales. Consumers are buying and this is not contracting, it is growing consistently with a continuation of the expansion in the economy. The secular problems that e-commerce causes for department stores can be turned into a strength when properly balanced with a strong e-commerce segment, as seen now by WMT, TGT and COST, who have figured out the formula. For clothing and housewares department stores, there still a big convenience factor for the person that wants to try something on but go back to the store to get a different size or color, or to have a convenient return location rather than just mailing things back. My own personal assessment of Macy's e-commerce activities is that they are doing an increasingly good job at shifting their advertising into that medium and they have very attractive e-commerce offerings. I think M well understands the need to combine their e-commerce in a proper mix with their well located and convenient stores. Each has strengths and M is making important changes in this mix. Over time they morphing into a more balanced retailer and they are benefiting from the secular move into e-commerce for that part of their business.I think the Ms will continue to find advantageous retail opportunities to get the right mix of their strengths, and they will turn the corner on organic profit growth. In the meantime, they have so many other ways to achieve improved profits, that it is extremely likely they will start posting some good numbers against the backdrop of recent weakness, which will make for good comparisons. We will see near term cost cutting combined with near term improvements in inventory management that will have potentially outsized effects with early signs. I continue to believe that regardless of the ultimate outcome, M is currently under an attack that has driven its PPS to undervalued territory, and this is the time to be a buyer. You make the most money by recognizing when something is an opportunity, and I still think the fact that M pays a good dividend is some icing on the cake that helps the long and hurts the short seller.",0.998

Please add onto my guesses if you have anything else. 1. somebody (or more than 1 person) in the accounting department has been sick and not working, particularly if it's somebody high up who does the final combining of the figures and notes 2. I assume with the stores closing 3/18 somebody or several have had plenty of time to take the inventory which didn't need to be rushed as usual (assuming they take an actual inventory at the end of the quarter instead of relying on a computer figure) since they had 42 days through 4/30 to do this leisurely therefore that really can't be the problem 3. They are trying to look at the figures from different locations rather than working in one department the way they usually would and that makes it much more difficult to see what they are doing on different screens and trying to combine things. I'd think it still wouldn't take that much more time though. 4 they (the management) know the results will be mediocre and they want to wait until they have some good news to report at the same time--for example by the end of June we now have some new financing and/or we have new sales figures for May and June which may be getting close to normal etc. so the bad news will be minimized with the good news which they release at the same time Obviously everybody who has mentioned how many shares Yachtman and Blackrock (and all the other institutional holders and mutual funds) own should be trying to contact them (maybe a couple of you could pick a name and try). I think somebody owning 38 million shares might have enough clout to get the president of Macy's to give them the reason(s) why this is being delayed and you could ask them.

The tariff problem will be solved one way or another soon enough. Grabbing a good dividend while you wait for improvements in operating performance makes sense for this retailer. As their 150 store improvement plan brings in more customers, and their new discount programs bring in more customers, M's just needs the right product and price mix and they know how to find that, IMO. In the late stages of the current market rally, this type of value play with a 5 PE, and a 10+% yield, on a very profitable old line company, where the low price is result of a market over-reaction on the down side that brings it to a bottom or near bottom, on a with a company that is making only small sales gains, and temporary profit volatility, seems more sensible than looking for a high priced growth company that will fall sharply at the first sign of a slow down.",0.9915

Once China and US finalize an agreement (inevitable) retail stocks benefit immensely. But here's something else to think about since Macy's ended 2018 with nearly 1.2B of cash on hand why did they decide to invest 1B (yes 1B) into renovating more stores and opening more backstages and blue mercury instead of buying back a massive amount of stocks or even paying down another 1B in debt? EIther they are very stupid or very smart. I'm leaning towards the latter bc they have the results and they see the numbers coming in from Growth50 stores and Backstages / Bluemercury.

The retailers are doing well owing to the full employment economy and U.S. discretionary spending remains strong. This is just what M needs to get its new sales initiatives working on the right basis. They will cut some jobs and reduce costs. They will pay down debt and reduce interest charges. They will buy back stock and lower cost of the dividend. They have new software and better technology to manage inventory at a store level. They are revising their discount programs to make them smarter and better targeted. They are making their stores more attractive to customers which already is a proven way to up their same store sales, and now it will extend to over 50% of their revenue. They are bring in third party vendors to improve margins in their internet sales and increase the catelogue attractiveness to internet buyers, a very good plan that Amazon uses. They are trying more backstage offerings of other brands, and the UPthread idea could also gain more traffic. With costs coming down, internet improving and instore opportunities better controlled with productivity software, they are going to have improving results and the PPS will respond handsomely if even some of this works. The dividend still is near 10% which is another reason to consider holding this stock as they are rewarding shareholders that trying to strengthen the stock value. It is a good plan and it is going to deliver a much better result, IMO. This is a strong department store chain with good properties and good locations in malls. Great buying opportunity with the stock having been dumped and further clobbered by short sellers who have driven PPS down disproportionately to the situation, all due to a single quarter miss. The opportunity here will not last if they get their plan working. The down side risk seems to be limited to me, while the upside seems to be large potentially.

One could sell their real estate and pay off all long term and short term debt and have enough left over to buy all buy back all outstanding debt and take Macys private and still have billions in cash left over. Now that's a cheap stock and an incredible bargain.The reason for this ridiculous under valuation is due to the retail stock sector being temporarily in a bear market caused by a perfect storm of factors that are all disappearing and the sun is starting to shine again with target doubling in price, walmart hitting highs, Rite Aid soaring from $7/share to $24/share after earnings refuting Goldman Sachs sell rating and ridiculous price target of $0.75/share as well as Bbby rising from $7/share to $18/share, then Nordstrom too nearly doubling after earnings refuting those who cry brick and mortar stores are dead. They do this to profit by shorting stocks hoping to capitalize on fear and ignorance. Fact is most annual sales or 80% in 2019 was at brick and mortar stores while online sales remains a minor part of total retail sales. Fact is brick and mortar stores will always be a majority of total sales annually. We are reaching a saturation point where online retailers will soon hit a wall with their share remaining at only 20% of total sales. Fact is most items are only bought at brick and mortar. That will never change. For instance one would never buy a formal dress attire online nor many other items for a host of reasons. Online sales will never replace brick and mortar. In our modern world and in the future retail sales will simply change and instead of going out of business retailers will simply adjust their business to cater to new trends. Macys first instance will not abandon brick and mortar but rather enhance them with online sales. For centuries retailers have closed poor performing stores and moved to better locations. Target and Walmart for instance closed hundreds of stores in 2019 and opened new ones at better locations. Macys likewise is well run and highly profitable with strong annual free cash flows. They are rapidly paying off all debt, while also upgrading their stores and rewarding investors with a safe secure dividend.Soon at this rate they will have no debt at all and as this sector bear market storm is disappearing we will see Macys stock shoot back up to a fair valuation of $75/share and maybe even more soon.Macys management is soon to reveal their exciting plans for growth for the next three years on Feb 5th.Shorts will lose this treacherous game soon and can lose unlimited sums.While longs will continue to be rewarded with a handsome dividend and awesome appreciation and capital gains.",0.9972

2076,"Going from bad to worseFrom 2015 to 2020, Macy's revenue has gone from $28 billion down to $25 billion. Struggling to get visitors into its stores, it has gone on a campaign of shrinking its physical footprint to try to match its scale to actual demand. This was all before the coronavirus outbreak started. Now, with the incredible change in circumstances, it may need to accelerate its plans to become smaller. As of Feb. 1, the company had $685 million in cash and equivalents and a whopping $5.2 billion worth of inventory. The company also tapped its credit facility, borrowing $1.5 billion. The added cash will give it more flexibility to make changes in the near-term. Still, its ability to turn that inventory into cash in the coming weeks and months will be crucial for the company. Otherwise, it may have to take substantial discounting measures if products go out of season, further complicating its troubles. Admittedly, the inventory figure is the norm for Macy's at this time of year. What's different now is that sales are going to be much lower than usual. Even though stores are beginning to reopen, the demand for clothing will likely be lower for at least a few months longer. Many schools will continue with remote learning in the fall, reducing back-to-school shopping. Businesses with employees that are capable of working from home are encouraged to continue operating remotely, similarly reducing the demand for new apparel.Under pressure from the drastic changes stemming from widespread stay-at-home orders, Macy's is moving to adapt. The problem for investors is that moving in haste increases the probability of making a costly mistake. And Macy's massive footprint with 776 locations makes it particularly more exposed to downside risk, because it's more difficult to make changes at such a large scale. What's more, even if it does handle the current pandemic well, it's still going to be competing with a difficult market for brick-and-mortar retailers in the aftermath.",-0.4178

Macy?s plans to reopen all 775 stores within 6-8 weeks after Monday?s 68 retail openings nationwide. 2. Macy?s current priorities is simply ensuring it?s got enough liquidity to navigate an uncertain future( closure of 125 stores within 3 years ) 3. Macy?s has been working with an investment bank Lazard, there is no news on what they are doing but possibly getting bonds up to as much as 5 billion dollars. Macy?s still has 1.5 billion dollars in credit on hand. 4. Macy?s is currently exploring several possible ways to raise money, possibility of bonds backed by some of its real estate and other #$%$ets such as inventory. 5. Macy?s is exploring numerous options to strengthen their capital structure. The downside of all of this?1. 125 stores will be closed in 3 years. 2. Normal sales will be down 20% when reopening.3. They will need to invest more in online advertising and their online services. They will need to spend more time widening their range of products and exclusive products at that. This will cost them the most money in the short term but will make them stronger in the future if this issue arises again. (Cost 750 million dollars.)

2112,"How Macy’s Could Be a Windfall Hidden in Plain Sight Fashion Is Evolving Beyond AppearancesThe fashion industry is reeling as its global supply chains have been disrupted by COVID-19, international tariffs have increased, and geo-political issues have mounted. At the same time, retail consumers have become more educated and concerned about the industry overall finding the heavy pollution resulting from the sourcing of materials, the international manufacture of clothes, the distribution of, what they consider ‘an overabundance of the same, expensive clothes’ to storefronts (both physical and online) that don’t integrate with their own shopping preferences to no longer be relevant to them. For today’s consumers aesthetics are no longer the sole factor driving purchases.Sustainability Is En VogueIncreasingly, consumers want to feel confident that the clothes they purchase are not contributing to global climate change and social inequities. Specifically, the entire process from manufacture, packaging, shipment, pricing, and even marketing of fashion is being scrutinized at higher levels for how well they treat all stakeholders, including employees, the local community, and the environment. Why buy from a company that is a part of the problem, when you can buy local and have a greater, more beneficial impact? Consumers are attracted to brands that are tacking action to address environmental, diversity, and other social initiatives. How well brands are able to commit to these values and incorporate them into all of their messaging will thus determine the future of retail, especially among the largest players.Fashion as a Lifestyle Choice Current ModelFuture ModelBrick & Mortar as a Distribution PointBrick & Mortar as a Media Platform",0.9724

2181,"Among the key things that Ms needs to do to improve its operating results is to get sales rising. One key problem is they have a lot of fixed costs which are rising with inflation, so they need to have growth in sales and good margins to make enough profits to handle these costs. A central issue is that sale growth over the last three years has not been sufficient to keep profits from eroding. They need to do a better job to get sales growth going again.Another way to cut the erosion of profits is to close weaker stores. And they will likely do that. This is a complicated task do to obligations Macy's has to keep stores open, and costs to close them.Another, part of the remedy can be to increase e-commerce and on line sales, which they have been doing in the past very well. Indeed this alone could turn the tide if they gain enough sales. There are special opportunities for Macys to capitalize on that Amazon does not have without stores. It is a convenient place for customers to return merchandise and M needs to make that a reasonably quick and easy thing to do. It brings the customer to the store where they can shop for a better size or different garment and look for other things they need. What starts as an on line sale can promote traffic in various ways.But clearly, as a department store, they need more and better traffic to the stores. IMO, M completely understands the issues associated with inadequate sales growth, and they are making an all out effort to build sales and store traffic by many different changes in their stores and operating practices. Part of the problem is to make the shopping experience better for customers. However there are many elements that must be handled and M has a team that is working on this from all directions.Competition is a big factor and M needs to compete better, which they are trying to do. They really have a lot of good stores that are in good malls but there are weaker ones too. All across the board they face competition, and working out how to be more effective in competing is central to their survival. They need to start picking up some market share, and that is not easy. However, they do have the advantage of size and experience and other stores are failing and going out of business so that is one place to gain some customers. Just do a good job and be one of the survivors; but that is not enough. They need to find things they can excel at. One of those is having the large inventory for the customer to access, see and feel. On line is convenient, but it is not the best way to buy clothes that look good, feel god and fit well. Big stores have inherent advantages if laid out right as COST and WMT and TGT have shown. Once M can get the store formula right, that can help them improve traffic and sales, IMO. They are working hard on that and I think they are likely to continue to improve e-commerce sales, and their 150 stores that have been remodeled giving early indications that sales growth is occurring there, which account for more than 50% of their sales at present. Cost reduction is another part of the solution, especially debt reduction that lowers interest costs, as that falls directly to profit, but cost reduction alone is not a complete solution and sales growth is a ""must do"" for Macys. Better inventory management is possible with more technology which M is trying to implement. This can reduce discounts which are not needed to move merchandise, which heretofore has been handled in a gross regional manner. Using better technology and mining their vast data better for a better understanding of what is happening on the store level can reduce costs and reduce unneeded discounts where merchandise is moving well It can also help then decide where to ship on line orders from more efficiently.Excessive discounts also eats into profit so they need a really good line of merchandise that is sellable without excess discounts and they need a really good understanding of their data to price everything for optimum profits. They implement pre-testing of merchandise and use other ways to get good merchandise at low costs. This is part of their power of being a large buyer. Another part of the job is presenting good merchandise well in the stores, and programs that enhance the appeal of merchandise and increase the average amount their good customers will buy with better inducement, using e-commerce, to advertise it at lower costs. Their SGA has been too high compared to similar stores, so this is another place where cost savings that get to the bottom line are possible. Another potential solution is to reduce the dividend. However, it appears that M views cutting the dividend as a last ditch approach because it holds up the stock value, and that is important too protect. The next few quarters should show they are making inroads on many of these issues, and the stock sentiment will improve, IMO. Once that happens, their PE multiples will jump.",0.9997

They are still selling godiva chocolates and pearls when people want basics that you can get in Target and used to get in Sears. How hard is this??!!

These companies have far worse prospects than Macy's in terms of profitability, real assets, and business model. Their p/b is lower and people think that their real assets are valuable enough to warrant. Macy's is also below p/b at current values with room to run, but I guess the market hasn't caught on yet.I just want to ask, would you feel more comfortable owning stock in Macy's or in any of the three stocks I listed because year to date the market is treating them fairly similarly when I don't find them to be very similar at all.",0.943

2330,"I think many people don't realize that Macy has about 100 fewer stores than a couple years back yet the total sales revenue is doing quite okay given so many store closures. Another thing that doesn't really get talked about is that Macy is spending 1B+ (cap ex) this year and last year to build and grow their blue mercury stores, backstage and growth 50 & growth 100 stores this year. Each upgraded growth 50 store is seeing better comps than the others and cost about 3 million to remodel each one. Last year they did 50, but opened 100 Back Stages. This year they will upgrade 100 stores and open about 45 backstages. Why so fewer Back Stage? That's just the trade off since back stage will have over 200 outlets already they decided to focus back on the main stores with growth 100 investments. The budget is only 1B so they can only do so much a year, plus it took a lot of hard work from management to open and oversee 100 Back Stage last year. Therefore by 2020 Macy will have 150 growth updated stores and over 200 Macy's Backstage. Earnings and Comps appears to be stabilizing and debt has been reduced from 6.5B from 2017 to 4.75B currently. If it wasn't for all the new Cap Ex investments Macys earnings will be much higher. Eventually after all the stores are opened and revenues see more growth Macy's could slow the Cap Ex investments and we can see higher EPS and even share buybacks since the debt ratio is currently at 2.9 EBIDTA without assets sales. They wanna see it between 2.5-2.8 before considering buybacks. Technically all they have to do is repurchase another 165M of debt and the ratio will drop to 2.8 all things being equal. But anyways i thought it's interesting that on April 3rd 2017 Macy was trading for 30 with 6.5B in debt and today Macy is trading for 25 with 4.75B in debt and 1.2B with cash. That 1.2B cash is earmarked for capex through this year but assuming revenue and sales meet guidance (which isn't very strong) Macy should have about 750M to deploy towards debt repurchases and or buybacks in 2019. I feel buybacks at 25 isn't a bad idea around $25 a share since it will eliminate the 6% dividend and lower share counts and Both would have an impact on EPS. At just 4.75B total debt currently Macy can afford to use cash for both debt reduction and buybacks unlike before when they used it all towards debt reduction b/c it was near 7B.. Good luck!",0.962

All in all, the operational headwinds are significant, but there are favorable tailwinds, too. Most of the headwinds can mitigated to a reasonable degree. Malls need Macys more than Macys needs malls. Higher tariffs are partly offset by Chinese makers wanting to retain Macys biz (pricing power) and stronger dollar. If mall traffic is weak, Macys can close stores or reduce lease costs since malls really really need to keep their anchor stores. Management needs to execute on things like inventory mgmt.

As well as the VR initiative for furniture shopping that I'm sure could be expanded upon. Also, the recent acquisition of STORY will present interesting plays on items in the future. Not to mention the initiative they are doing with social platforms to encourage users to share their experience, which is turn promotes their store and products.

They have a large loss but that is mostly from write-downs, not really on cash losses. 2021 they will almost certainly hit $20B. if they just trade at 0.5 times revenue that would put them at roughly $30 a share. (I would think that would only be reached in the summer once it was obvious that they are on track to strong returns, and a path for growth from the $20B was clear for 2022.There seems to be no reason they should not be able to get back to $3.5-$5 a share profit that they saw in 2018 and 2019. Lets say they hit $3 a share with the future looking like $4 a share in 2022, That could drive a 10x multiple. Especially if they can create a story around digital sales.

I clearly remember several years back when Best Buy was trading around 11 dollars!! Let that sink in for a bit. Everyone thought Amazon Amazon Amazon. Somehow people forgot that shopping for electronics is more than just reading Amazon reviewing and clicking. I see the exact same thing with Macy’s. Here’s my prediction: the naysayers/short sellers hope for this to go bankrupt, but in reality Macy’s will make a few jumps to 6, 7, 9 and before you know it to low teens.

The numbers coming out of the sector are all extremely good, guidance has been excellent, consumer confidence is at multi-decade highs, unemployment is at generational lows, consumer debt loading is at multi-year lows, consumers have more money in reserves than they have in years, and enthusiasm for the upcoming Holiday season is indicating record breaking numbers and increases YOY from as low as 4% to as high as 8%. The only ""logical"" reason for the sector dump is a concerted effort by brokerage houses to manipulate the sector and drop the prices to create amazing entry points. Regardless of how analysts and shorts try and convince Main Street that stocks are at ridiculous P/E levels, that is only true of a few high fliers, mainly in the tech sector and that is/has readjusted tremendously over the past month.

The yield is falling as the PPS rises, so today also is the last day to capture the current yield of 8.93 if the PPS keeps rising, which it seems like it will do to me. Do your own due diligence and you will see the dividend is covered by sufficient income to be continued and that M has paid uninterrupted dividends since 2002. Personally, I think the way they plan to use technology will improve their management of inventory and generate added profits, and their third party vendor initiative will enhance their internet catalogue profit and margins. Their exploration of more discount programs in store through Backstage brands at discounts and their use of UPthreads to bring in another class of customer willing to look at used clothing also will broaden their appeal and traffic. I also like their more targeted advertising using technology and their focus on individual store inventory rather than regional focus. They have a great position in the market in malls to sell their products if they can squeeze more margin and profits which technology can help them accomplish; and if they widen out their product offerings successfully that, too, could be a big boost to profits. Even if none of that is accomplished, they are earning enough to keep paying down debt which lowers costs of debt and increases their profits. This is a company that is about to make a big improvement in sentiment and they will sport a much better PE than 5x EPS, which will translate into a higher PPS. There is so much favorable going on that the risk at the current prices is nil and the upside is easily $30/share, IMO. I like the growth stocks, but a balanced portfolio should look at this opportunity closely before you pursue only growth stocks that are selling at very high valuations.

Macy's quarterly dividend has been stalled at $0.3775 since mid-2016.WMT is fairly valued and has remained so while the share price has increased. An investor might buy WMT and put the shares away for a decade with a reasonable expectation that the share price and dividend will continue to increase in proportion to steady increases in revenue. The possible attraction to M is that M has been beaten down, appropriately so, for its failure to deliver on increased sales and increased dividends. The question du jour is whether or not M can, or will, deliver on future results sufficient for the share price to increase by four or five times while the dividend yield drops back to an historic level of two or three percent even while annual increases in the dividend rate resume.Macy's is a cyclical recovery play.",0.9896

I don't know whether or not it will hit signle digits but I'm pretty confident someone is eyeing a big move on M with a 3.8B marketcap. I mean forget fundamentals for a sec and use logic. If M went to 9 its market cap would be 2.7B which means 1 year of dividend would buyback bout 18% of the shares and save it about 85M a year in future dividend payouts.

The Rating Outlook has been revised to Stable from Negative. A full list of ratings is provided at the end of this release.The Outlook revision to Stable reflects Fitch's continued expectation that Macy's can sustain flat to modestly positive comparable store sales (comps) and stabilize annual EBITDA in the $2.5 billion range, similar to the $2.6 billion reported in 2018 which was in line with Fitch's expectation. The company has paid down over $2 billion in debt over the last two years, ending 2018 with adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing rent at 8x) of 2.6x modestly better than expectation. Macy's has committed to using 2019 FCF towards debt reduction and leverage could improve modestly by 0.1x-0.2x over the next 12-24 months.",-0.0702

Then UK parliament will get to work to see if they can finally agree. There are good prospects for a reasonably quick settlement and this can kick start a year end rally. M should do well if the market goes into rally mode.Other catalysts include a trade deal with China which can take some pressure off the risk that costs of goods will rise. Trump needs to get some wins to fight the impeachment problem, and I expect he will sign a phase 1 deal, another market catalyst that can help M, and all retailers.The Fed will meet soon and the odds on bet is they will further drop the interest rates another quarter point. This may be built in largely but it still will help and re-assure the markets. Another, even bigger QE factor is the FED is enlarging its bond holdings. Estimates this can have a large QE effect for the next several months as FED is adding $60B/month.The impeachment issues also are a drag on the market because they create uncertainty. As this political matter progresses, the Republicans probably will side with Trump and it will become clear that the impeachment will not succeed in removing Trump from office. Whatever you think of Trump, that still will remove some uncertainty and allow the market rally to move forward.In addition to the broad forces that will work in Ms favor, you cannot deny that M's has been sold hard for 1 year. The problem is whether you think it is oversold or not. This is pretty clear, IMO, but the shorts of course will argue the other side. One thing that is hard to understand is why the shorts will take the position M's multiple programs to ramp sales, earnings, margins and free cash flow are all going to fail in the face of a potentially good year end selling season. They have the argument that it is a shortened selling period, but that is very weak. The consumer is well employed and in a good position. If the other catalysts mentioned above strike a favorable tone, the consumer will also have the rising market to comfort and help the buying season.We already have seen that TGT, COST, WMT, HD and AMZN can achieve great sales gains. The idea that M, JWM, KSS, and other large, well capitalized department stores cannot figure out the formulas to do the same is bunk.Anyone that studies the initiatives M's has put in place should be encouraged and betting on them to achieve some or all their goals which can translate into a very big turn around in sales, earnings, margins and free cash flow. M's has a genuine chance to be a super performer from these low PPS numbers if it puts together a few quarters showing the market some success. The catalysts are in place for a big change in sentiment on Ms. No one can say how much they will succeed, but the chances are excellent and the risk here is low, IMO. Please do your own due diligence, and whatever you do, ignore the short seller that spue only FUD, as they don't have your best interest. They are trying to raise arguments that cause fear, but as JFK once said, elegantly ""the only thing we have to fear is fear itself"" and this may be an appropriate thing to keep in mind with M if you think it is way oversold.",0.9987

It is going to be hard for the shorts to see the dividend harvesters drive the PPS up, knowing that more shorting the PPS dow1n will only bring more dividend hunters, lol. Shorts are in a ""no win"" box because, now the PPS goes up plus the pay the dividend. The short can race to cover or not, but the last to cover pays the most. Shorting now just does not pay, or make sense. The dividend is in, and the PPS obviously is way too low, plus a year end rally will lift all boats. Just imagine what happens to the shorts if M beats expectations, for example, like TSLA just did, LOL. Credit Suisse made a garbage analysis based on a shortened holiday sales season and weather prediction, with no consideration to the fact that M already completed it's 150 store improvement, so those capx expenses are coming down, it intends to pay down debt, so those interest costs are coming down, and Macy's has a technology plan to increase productivity and save another $400 to $500 Million. Not one word about those savings hitting the bottom line; and, CS failed to even comment on whether Ms other initiaves will grow sales. CS is betting on a bad Xmas sales season, which frankly, is dead wrong. What are the shorts going to do when sales turn up and costs turn down in a year end rally with the M dividend looking like a great chance to get yield from a under priced dividend aristocrat that has not missed a dividend payment since 2002. And, what will the shorts do when Macy's board goes after them with a stock buy back program. Shorts are screwed and the smart ones are already boxed, or covering.

3213,"Retail Stocks That Could Burn Short SellersBy Forbes.. Schaeffer's Investment ResearchSchaeffer's Investment Research, ContributorThe retail sector has found new life going into the 2017 holiday season, helped in part by headlines about record-breaking spending. Take for example the SPDR S&P Retail ETF, which has jumped almost 15% over the past six months. This recent surge could be catching a number of traders off guard, given the elevated short-interest levels seen on a handful of notable retailers, including Macy's, Dillard's, and Nordstrom.Macy's stock bottomed at $17.41 on Nov. 7, a seven-year low. But the shares have bounced back nicely, last seen trading at $25.36, taking back the 200-day moving average in the process. The price action may be partly why the security saw a price-target hike from Susquehanna to $25 from $20 on Tuesday. Still, 10 of 13 analysts recommend just holding or even selling the retailer.Elsewhere, short interest has exploded on the stock, with 70 million shares held by short sellers -- or 23% of the total float -- the most in at least 15 years. Going by M's average daily trading volumes, it would take these bears almost a week to cover their positions.As for Dillard's, the stock was last seen trading at $60.74, as it also enjoys support from the 200-day moving average. The shares have carved out a series of higher lows in recent weeks, and Susquehanna expects the trend to continue. The brokerage firm just raised its price target to $62 from $58.Short interest is elevated on DDS, too. In fact, more than two weeks' worth of buying power is dedicated to short interest, based on average daily volumes. An extended push higher could prompt some of these bears two weeks to cover.Finally, Nordstrom stock has rallied over 23% since its November low, last seen trading at $46.54. Susquehanna just upped its price target to $49 from $43, too, predicting the shares to push through recent resistance in the $48 region.Short sellers are hoping this prediction is wrong, since they control 17.6% of JWN's float. Based on average daily volumes, it would take them more than seven sessions to cover their positions.",0.9979

That being said just keep in mind that these 125 Stores account for only 1.4B or roughly 5% of Macy's total revenue where as the top 150 Growth Stores account for roughly 12.5B or 50% of total sales. Therefore these stores are relatively insignificant to Macy's profitability, in fact i would even say closing these stores would allow Macy's to focus on those more productive stores and expect margins to improve greatly. They won't have to waste time, energy and money on upkeep on those unprofitable stores. It's a huge win and M is expected to save 600M this year alone and 1.5B a year once everything is said and done.

Dillard's is a very similar store with a third of the store fronts and only in 31 states and they earn 5 dollars a share. At the end of the day the old adage of ""if you're not growing you're dying"" becomes counterproductive. Even the likes of Wal-mart have realized that their growth in lieu of profits was counterproductive and have become much more focused on growing in the proper areas. I am much more interested to see the details about the top 150 performing stores that they have already invested substantial funds into renovating. It does not concern me that they closed stores in downtown Seattle, downtown San Fran, downtown Chicago, Macy's has always been a great corporate and community citizen and they choose to work with downtown revitalization programs to keep their storefronts open while these cities and teams tried to bring back their downtown areas, many of these efforts have succeeded, many have not. Fortunately, Macy's has made the difficult decisions to leave very long time leases or ownership positions to focus on storefronts and locations which are growing. I would much prefer they follow the Dillard's model versus the Wal-mart model. That is what eventually took Sears down, they were too slow at adapting to the inevitable -- change. Change can be for the good and it can mean smaller revenues, but for the right reasons, higher profits.",0.9953

I don't think anyone really believes that Macy's will go bankrupt, they still make three bucks a share, they still have billions of real estate. Did they execute poorly this quarter, yes, and they got hammered for it, though they also executed very well the previous quarter and got what, hammered for that as well. It merely suits the desires of those who really control the markets to tank them. They did everything in their power to create fear and chaos leading up to the Christmas holiday to try and mitigate what was on track to be the best holiday season in decades, they succeeded.

3442,Here's my take on what Macy's is going to do with that 5B soon. Keeping in mind M likely has about 500M left of that 685M of cash on hand at end of the year since they haven't been shut too long ago. That being said i think they will refi 1.5B in debt due with the next 3 years so nothing is due fir 5+ years. 500M allocate towards capex this year and 3B will ensure M has plenty of liquidity for 2 years. BUT WAIT. . There 1 more B left how can M put this best to use? I'd say 500M in buybacks could trim 25% of the float is a great use of capital when share prices are so far below book. The extra 500M is just more cushion. And there u go 6B can easily include buybacks...i hope they do it quickly tho.,0.9874

3490,"Amazon is looking to expand its realestate holdings through acquisitions and is holding $27 billion in cash which will be an immense tax liability if not reinvested before year end. It is looking at Macy's as M owns the real estate it's stores are in and it will give Amazon access to clothing lines it currently cannot access, specifically Ralph Lauren (RL), featured prominently at Macy’s stores, or Canada Goose (GOOS), sold at Bloomingdale’s (which Macy’s owns). Look for an announcement before Ocrober ends, perhaps even befor September ends. The Ocrober 2, $7.00 call options are experiencing a volume increase as detailed in an article today. Amazon is also looking at JC Penney but not as good a fit or as beneficial to Amazon as Macys is. JC may be potentially acquired after bankruptcy for pennies on the dollar. Macy's is going to survive. The willingness of banks to finance them through the c19 retail collapse is testimony to that. The primary consideration when loaning money is the ability to repay the loan. Macy's was extended financing because the institutions extending the financing feel Macys has the ability to repay the debt. It is validation of Macy's strength. So if Amazon wants Macy's it will have to pay and better ooner than later. The longer Amazon waits the higher the acquisition cost will be as Macys recovers with the exonomy and at years end the $27 billion of uninvested cash sitting in Amazon's cash accounts will become taxable.

While I will be the first to say that Macy's has been slow on the uptick morphing the company to meet the new realities of e-commerce and a younger generation who may or may not shop at their mom's stores, they have really been unfairly beaten down. I also believe the fact that the beat down is continuing into today when the rest of retail has staged a bit of a recovery is indicative of the big money understanding the composition of the Macy's investors, as I said many older and retired small retail investors. So they know if they can use the shock and awe approach that will shake many of these investors out of the stock as happened yesterday, but they also know that many of those investors have seen big drops and may not have flinched off of their investments. Now if they can continue the drop while other retail improves, that will cause them to question the company and the stock.

The issues that they used were with the exception of the international tourist shopping decline not systemic. There was poor execution by the designers and purchasers, poor inventory mix and poor design aesthetic, this just proves that the markets are being used to promote a greater narrative, that the economy is not strong and that the consumer is weak. The numbers from Capri and KTB as well as Macy's show that revenues are good to very good, how one company or even multiple companies execute is an individual issue not a sector or economic issue. The drop in international tourism sales is to be expected, prior to the recent 25 basis point drop by the Fed, the US was the only economy actually raising rates, therefore the dollar became as President Trump said, too strong.",0.9721

I would love to hear an analyst call BS and say purely that Macy's was over-punished in the past by rhetoric of them not being able to adapt to changing climates, the nonsense of cutting the dividend, and garbage of being compared to companies going out of business. The FACTS are the Macy's had a great quarter, and they are adapting on multiple fronts. ""For the second quarter, comparable sales were up 0.5% on an owned plus licensed basis, but when adjusted for the Friends and Family shift from the second quarter to the first, comparable sales were up 2.9% on an owned plus licensed basis for the quarter.""IMO -The truth for the sell off was that large MM sold at the top to collect a nice gain so they could shift their profits somewhere else. The sell-off more than likely spooked a lot of people and also probably triggered some stop quotes, which over sold the heck out of this thing (RSI). The sell off was over done and we found a floor at the 100 day MA. I think this is a nice entry point for the next crawl up, and we will eventually get back to where we were.

This in turns allow the big money boys to drive the prices down even further. The news media blows up the fact that people are worried, this in turn creates the perception that maybe the economy really isn't that strong and maybe we might lose our jobs, so maybe we shouldn't spend as much money on Christmas.

3675,"Broad market rally today, Friday, with DJI up .56%, the NSDQ up .70% and the S&P500 up .4%, and the S&P500 hit an intraday all time high. Personally, I think their is very strong odds in favor of a year end rally, unlike last year when the market suffered a sharp correction. I won't go into all the reasons again, but my analysis is that, if there is a rally, it is going to be up about 10% from here. So, as a speculative thought piece, which one should take with a grain of salt, since this sort of thing is just one scenario, I offer the view that M will participate with its PPS moving up in that hypothetical rally. So, how much might it move up if there is a 10% rally in the broad averages from here.In the rally today, M was up 1.23% as it closely followed the retail group represented by XRT which was up 1.07%. As you guys know I contend M is oversold and undervalued, and heavily manipulated by the short interest. So, suppose these relationships hold for such a rally. M is part of the S&P500 which rse .41% today while M rose 1.23%, or 2.86 times the amount the S&P500 rose on a day it hit a all time high. Using this sample as a talking point, that could imply that a 10% rise in the S&P500 in a year end rally could translate into a 28.6% rise in M, just going on the broad market as a catalyst for M's PPS move. Today's closing price for M is $15.58, so applying a possible 28.6% rise, that would yield a PPS for M after such a rally of about $20.03. In other words, M would close the upside gap around $18-$19 and tack on another dollar. That is a nice return, should it come to pass, especially while you earn a 9.69% dividend (which is the theoretical yield based on today's close.)Now, it happens that the M's board has just today, after the close, declared the next quarterly dividend of $37.75 payable to those owning the stock on Dec 13, as I have been contending they would do. So add that to the approximately $4.50 that I have estimated M will return in improved PPS. Very nice.Then try to figure out if M will beat expectations in the next quarterly announcement, if it will pay down the debt, improve earnings, sales, margins or free cash flow. Anything that changes the sentiment on Ms will likely double (or more) these estimates, IMO.Have a good weekend, and do your due diligence and buy M before it runs.",0.9971

The company had 130,000 employees and earned annual revenue of $24.8 billion as of 2017.Macy's has conducted the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City since 1924 and has sponsored the city's annual Fourth of July fireworks display since 1976.

He successfully stabilized sales, even improving sales and EBITA, net earnings and last year was a great year for Macys. The current CEO also expanded its successful Blue Mercury business to near 200 locations and opened new Macys in better locations and closed poor performing stores in undesirable locations and he wisely slowly closed them as their leases expired so as not to take a hit for breaking leases. A wise retail CEO constantly evaluates all his store locations and closes poor performers and opens new ones at better locations. Retailers have been doing this for hundreds of years. Why is it that when Macys decided to close a mere 30 stores it is big news but Walmart and Target closed HUNDREDS Of stores last year as they do regularly.

3880,"Two weekends ago, I wrote my thoughts on GME and why it was undervalued at $35/share. Then last weekend, I did a follow-up commentary to explain 5 reasons why GME was still undervalued at $65/share and was going to go triple digits. Well, we all know how that turned out. Today I would like to highlight Macy’s (M) and explain why it is undervalued at $15/share.Macy’s is a department store operator with a market cap of $4.7B. If you look at its business the four years prior to 2020, it was fairly stable with revenues during that 4 year period ranging from $25.3-25.9B with EBITDA greater than $2.1B for each year during that period. They were aggressively deleveraging during this period having reduced debt from $7.6B to $4.2B (these number exclude capital leases). Then in 2020, the COVID crisis occurred and Macy’s business suffered mightily as stores were closed due to local restrictions. Management took a number of actions such as raising additional cash, suspending the dividend, cutting CAPEX, closing unprofitable stores, reducing inventory and cutting SG&A. In 2020, sales will likely end up being down about 30% to $17.8B with EBITDA being slightly positive (~$50M). But I would argue that 2020 will be the trough in revenues and earnings for Macy’s. As we move into 2021 and the pandemic mitigates, people will return to shopping in stores and Macy’s sales will start to show Y/Y positive comps as they progress through the year. Current average analyst expectations for 2021 call for M to make $0.65/share.However, I believe that Wall Street is way too bearish on this company. Currently 6 analysts rate Macy’s as a sell with one brave analyst going positive on the company in December with a Buy rating. But if you look at the last two earnings releases, Macy’s blew away analyst’s weak expectations by wide margins with upside surprises of $0.96/share in Q2 and $0.60/share in Q3. With this bearish slant, I believe M will blow away expectations again in Q4. The average analyst expectation only calls for earnings of $0.04/share in the holiday quarter. But I project they will make just shy of $1/share (ex. items) assuming sales come in about $6.7B. Part of the reason for the bearish stance is many of these analyst’s clients are short Macy’s stock.One of the biggest arguments shorts make is the Macy’s in too indebted with high interest debt. But at the end of Q3, M had $1.55B in cash on the balance sheet and had net debt of only $3.8B. The cash level will only improve coming out of the holiday quarter where EBITDA will be greater than $700M. When revenues return to normalized levels, the debt level is <2x EBITDA. With the cash on the balance sheet, they have ample liquidity to cover interest payments of $80M/quarter. Also, no significant debt maturities are coming due in the next couple years that are not already covered by existing cash and future cash flows. Some of M’s debt is secure by their real estate holdings which is valued at double the current market cap of the company.When I look at how they compare against competitors, their stock price currently is priced at a discount. Macy’s sells for a P/S of 0.24 compared with Kohl’s (0.42), Dillard’s (0.43) or Nordstrom’s (0.51). One could argue that share price should be selling for around $30/share to have comparable valuations. But I would argue that Macy’s should have a higher multiple due to their e-Commerce business which made up 38% of sales in the most recent quarter growing at a 27% Y/Y clip. Macy’s is currently the 10th largest e-Commerce retailer in the US (Amazon is #1 and sports a 4.5 P/S). If I look at those on the list that are slightly bigger players, all are brick & mortars and sport much higher P/S ratios, #7 Best Buy (0.62), #8 Target (1.04) and #9 Costco (0.91). If valued with a similar P/S ratio, Macy’s should sell for $38-65/share.Part of the reason Macy’s share price is depressed is because it is heavily shorted. Currently over 28% of the float is short the stock. The shorts are unjustifiable bearish on a company that is undervalued compared to its peer even though has a greater e-Commerce presence and will be returning to profitability in 2021 post COVID. But I think other players in the market will exploit this heavily shorted situation in the near term by pushing the shares higher. Heavy buying of Feb. 19 calls would suggest the price will be pushed higher ahead of the company’s earnings release which will likely happen late in February. If Q4 earnings exceed analyst expectations by a large margin as I expect, we could see a short squeeze due to the heavy short interest.We will see what happens with Macy’s this month and longer term. My contention is it is worth a lot more than $15/share, more realistically it is worth $30-40/share, which is why I am long.",0.9932

Anyone that follows analysts will never make real money as they are ALWAYS LAGGING the market. TJX has sales of $42b and market cap of $65b. Macy’s has sales of $24b and market cap of $3b. Once they turn around their sales trends, and they will, their market cap will be at least $25b... so price will equate to $75 plus. Analysts are brain dead and are rarely right.

3932,"Here are a few reasons why I think Macy's will survive and flourish in the long term (or get bought by a giant e-commerce like Amazon): Macy's serves a market segment that isn't served by any other retailer. Think about all the young folks shopping for prom dresses, suites, makeup, wedding gifts, shoes, brand clothing, etc. that are a few notches higher than Target, but not as expensive some boutique stores. For all the stuff I mentioned above, Macy's is like a natural go-to place. Some other high-end retailers have already gone bankrupt (Neiman Marcus for example). JCP is already a goner. Macys' has far less competition now than it did a year ago. I think there is always need for a retailer like Macy's (not too expensive, and not too ""ordinary"" like Target/Ross/Marshalls/TJmax, etc.) for makeup, brand name clothing, and shoes. To serve this segment, Macy's is already there. Either it survives as a business, or perhaps get bought out by Amazon (or some other giant). The important point is there is demand for the kinds of stuff that Macy's sells, and no other retailer quite fit that bill. BTW, today's drop was on very low volume. Nothing to worry about. I know it seems like the end of the world as if COVID will never disappear, but fear not, things will come back to normal, and soon enough there will be a vaccine. Macy's will go up and people will start shopping. You cannot shut down an entire country for years. Mark this post, Macy's will pull through this.",0.9956

Wow, a nearly ten percent yield, the stock is going into its strong quarter, everything is pointing to a strong ""Santee Claus"" rally both in the markets and in retail sales. On-line sales dropped for the first time EVER in October, meanwhile we already are seeing very good numbers from retailers and fashion houses. Carters had great numbers last week and they fall right into the demographic that shops in Macy's. Huge short positions as the Gnome mentions they are naked shorts. Nearly a buck thirty off of 52 week low, but over 50% down from 52 week high, so upside potential is much greater than downside. Secured dividend was the move that the board needed to take, now the likes of J are saying they should raise it after saying they would cut it for about six months now. If a trade deal comes down the pipeline, the markets will explode, S and P over 4000 is a distinct possibility and retail and fashion will explode and shorts will go down in flames and they know. That is why they are upping their game now. Guess what, no dividend cut Gnome and J and our new shorts sneaking in under new aliases.",0.9913

There is no need to discuss next logical moves for this company or for that matter any company under the auspices of helping share holders or even the overall markets. Everything that is happening in the markets has been scripted but in such a way that there is no linkage or even trends to allow a small investor to make intelligent investing decisions. Case in point, Macy's report crashed the stock for several days, Nordstorm's comes out with a similarly weak and unimpressive report, they dropped a fraction of the fall that Macy's had and it started to recover almost immediately. Yesterday we saw Signet report and the stock losses a quarter of its value and is still weak today, today Tiffany comes out with a similarly weak report and poor guidance and the stock goes up. The same is true throughout retail and for that matter every sector in the market. Bed, Bath and Beyond has a lack luster report, after multiple downward revisions and their stock pops.

4210,"""Retail sales in August were stronger than expected, consumer sentiment also came in solid."" (Quote From Barrons) IMO, This climate is just right for Macy's new initiatives to work to improve traffic for the holiday season. With the widely observed trend towards lower priced value stocks away from the higher priced growth stocks, it is harder to find one more fitting than M with a solid $25 B in sales year after year, a high sustainable dividend well over 8% (at the current price, but that won't last long if the PPS keeps rising), consistently large earnings per share between $3 and $4, and possibly higher if their current plans work, and good free cash flow to reduce debt, which cuts cost substantially and enables higher profits (something they have been doing every year lately), and with over 40 quarters of improvement in their internet parts of the sales platform which is a key metric for this Amazon age (plus they have started an Amazon type initiative to get high margin third party vendors added to their internet offerings for more diverse products and addition internet income). They also are working on more ways to reach out to their communities and bring more customers into the stores by a major, now compete program to upgrade the key stores that account for 50% of their total sales (which they already know is working to improve comparative store sales), and they a opening more Backstage sections which brings in other bargain offers, plus now they are experimenting with a new trend towards offering pre worn close at a large discount for those that want a deal a well known brands. So much going on, and they still plan to buy back stock to further reduce the cost of dividends and keep them as an important part of shareholder appeal (and M has already become a steady dividend payer that has not missed a dividend since 2002 so we can expect this will continue unabated). For a stock that fell from last years $40 PPs on on a bad quarter, this is now a ""value stock"" with a good risk reward ratio and in step with the current market rotation. Please do your own reviews and due diligence, but IMO it is a strong buy.",0.9988

How the markets react with all of the stupidity that is associated with Corona virus are irrelevant. When the uber wealthy want to tank the markets, they will succeed, they own 80% of the world's wealth. If you want to see an activist investor, great, what are they going to do? Demand the company be put up for sale, okay, assume best case, fifty percent premium, that puts the acquisition price at 17, do you really believe that is a fair valuation for the company? Also, the company does seem to be making moves, even the announcement of the new line up from Bernstein, they are looking at and introducing omni channel marketing/sales, she is a very big Insta-gram influencer, that is the wave of the future for retailers. So overall, a very good move, probably need to bring on about seven or eight others, pick the top three or four after a one or two year period and dump the rest. May even need to cycle through different influencers. I don't think it would be prudent to invest the huge sums of money that Coty did to acquire a controlling position in Kylie Jenner's cosmetics company. I saw that move as a fourth and goal from the twenty yard line with ten seconds left in the game by Coty. I see our position as more like third and ten on the 30 with two minutes to go, need to expand their social media face, but do so with a eye to the future not out of desparation. I think Coty overpaid by at least fifty percent, though who knows, maybe it pays off, but usually the pioneers die.

4229,"M no longer have a debt issue in my opinion, having paid down 2.5B in the past 2 years. It now has 4.75B in debt and 1.2B in cash which they choose to use to renovate stores and open more Backstages. They could have chosen to eliminate even more debt or use it to buyback stocks. The debt is low enough that anyone can reasonably see that even if M stagnants or even continues to slows a bit the debt will continue to get lower. M can also as a last result choose to eliminate dividends (ignoring stock prices) and pay off that debt even quicker or accelerate asset sales again. That won't happen bc M's debt is now reasonably low enough and M is still making twice the amount it pays out in dividends. That being said M should be at the very least be a $30 stock and still paying over 5% dividend. It makes no sense for M to be trading at $24 priced as if it's going out of business within the next few years. That's just not the case. M real estate far exceeds it's enterprise value at these levels. With just 4.75B in debt and 1.2B in cash and making $3 a share a year and paying $1.51 a share in dividends plus some prized real estate assets i don't reasonably see how M can even go backrupt. M could decide to use 1.2B in cash now to pay down another 1B in debt and also eliminating dividends and using all profits to pay debt could make M debt free in about 3 years. I just don't see M deteriorating that quickly, as a matter of fact they look like stabilizing if anything. Then when debt is paid off you are left w a profitable company that has 0 debt and 15B+ in real estate value. AT 15B marketcap and 0 debt M is abiut a $50 stock folks.

So while it is now apparent, the Democrats have come to the blaring conclusion that they only have one way of defeating Trump in 2020, a major recession. So the liberal Wall Street boys (who give 3 dollars to liberal candidates for every one dollar to a conservative), the uber wealthy (look at Forbes list of top 50 billionaires, other than the Koch brothers who hate Trump, all are liberal), the news media (do I really need to explain that one), and the financial banks (mostly run by liberals) analysts will do whatever necessary to make that a reality.

If Jack Nickolaus and his wife being in their 80s who just had it said his wife had no symptoms at all and he only had a mild cold, sore throat for a few days before totally recovering with no medical assistance needed, then how much of a threat is it to healthy Americans who are much younger?The answer is Covid on threat to most Americans, only the weakest and oldest like those in assisted living facilities. When NY had its highest deaths most or 60% came from assisted living facilities.They would have died from one thing or another anyways.My family and I wont be taking the new Covid vaccine when it comes out as we are healthy and covid is no threat to our health at all.This covid scare nonsense will all be over soon.

He stated that Macy’s is understaffing stores and losing sales. I saw 7 behind the counters, a couple might have been managers. And I liked their new layout over the past. While looking at kitchen merchandise, a clerk even asked me if I needed help. There was plenty of staff everywhere.

Strong fundamentals, debt reduction that yields cost reductions, better use of technology that yields higher productivity and margin increase, better stores that account for 50% of sales, better e-commerce app, better offerings with third party sellers developing, strong dividend that M will continue, big improvements in inventory management with shift to store level, better programs on shipping that reduce shipping costs, cost cutting announcement coming.

The market cap for ESRT is $5billion. Which makes M's real estate at Herald Square probably worth well over $1billion, perhaps closer to $2billion.

4466,"My Visit to Herald SquareI took a tour of Macys' flagship store. The Christmas windows are as wonderful as ever. The main floor was a bustling, vibrant showcase. Visually it is very stimulating, edging on bedlam. There were many shoppers on a Friday night. Every major high-end brand has a sign, a kiosk, a little shop of its own - Coach, Vuitton, Tag Heuer, an entire Apple Store, etc ad infinitum. Everything is brightly lit, full of video and color, and of course, there is another glazing of Christmas decor on top of it all. The second and third floors were brightly lit and sharp-looking. Again, major brands had their own little sections all around. In fact, many brands such as North Face have more than one mini-store in the store.Some of the older sections, on upper floors, have scarcely changed. I easily recognized the counter where I bought my first Braun electric razor many decades ago. It still has Braun appliances stacked all around. The idea of ""destination shopping"" is in evidence, but not yet fully developed. You can take cooking lessons there! There are many places to eat and drink, including a gelato shop. The children's floor even has a McDonalds. Know that each floor of Herald Square has more retail space than my entire local mall. In a few short hours, I didn't see everything. Conclusions: the Christmas season looks to be going well. Throngs of energetic young salespeople were selling to throngs of shoppers on the main floor. All your favorite brands are available for purchase. But some areas, on the upper floors, were quite quiet. Redecoration and redesign proceed apace, but large areas remain untouched.",0.9921

The dividend probably is safe, and they even might do some stock repurchasing too if they think the PPS is too low. If M continues the dividend, gets costs down, pays down the debt - a lot of iffs, I would think the stock is way oversold. Just keeping the current dividend going should make this an attractive income play; and the forward PE is very low right now. I wonder how the Christmas season sales will go with employment being low and the consumer spending apparently strong. There is potential here for a nice turn around from these levels. Obviously, the PPS might go lower if Trump keeps piling on the tariffs and that raises costs, but, on the other hand, it could get a nice boost if Trump and China agree to roll back some of the threatened tariffs over the weekend. Hard to predict the near term, but I think M will get some cost reductions and the profits will come back up. You have to remember that sales increased year over year and the factors that hurt profits can be changed. M has a growing on line presence and a lot experience in their business. Will management improve the profit picture this Christmas? I don't know but, this is a very out of favor stock right now and things could change. I think the institutions will stop selling soon since the PPS is in a very realistic place right now; and then, in a few weeks it could see a nice bounce from here.",0.9932
