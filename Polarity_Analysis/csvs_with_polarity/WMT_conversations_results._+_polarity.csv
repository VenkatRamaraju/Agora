4,"Still Short a lot of shares of WMT. Still think there is a good chance this will turn around and fall down once the regular session starts. Running with a 10% Bracketed, Conditional OCO Cover order. So, if WMT should rally strong and hits $152.73, or, my preferred option, collapses down to $124.97, all of my shares will be immediately Covered for either a huge profit or a huge loss. Either way, I get out and move on to the next one. Which will most likely be a Sell Short of TJX, they report earnings pre-market tomorrow and stock price should collapse in direct response. Most likely neither 10% move will hit, in which case I plan to stay Short WMT until the early-mid afternoon. See what happens... :-) Good Luck Folks!",0.9609

Mayor Ted Wheeler said during a news conference, according to the Associated Press.?I say to them today, ?Stop you are not helping, you are hurting black people,? added Gordly, the first Black woman to be elected to the Oregon State Senate.The Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse was the site of nightly clashes between rioters and police last spring and the violence has again ramped up in recent weeks. Federal officers were stationed outside the building for much of the summer but were removed at the behest of local and state officials. Wheeler was forced to move out of his Portland apartment building after rioters set fire to the building?s lobby over the summer.The Department of Justice has reportedly paid more than $1.5 million to repair the damage done to the courthouse in the months of unrest, according to the Oregonian. City police spent almost $8 million responding to the riots, making over 900 arrests throughout 120 consecutive days of unrest.Fencing that surrounded the building was removed last week, but was later reinstalled on Sunday after protestors set fires, smashed windows and tagged the federal courthouse with spray paint.The fence went back up at the tail end of another destructive week for the city: rioters broke windows and tagged buildings downtown with anti-government and anti-police sentiments on Thursday.

Kohls went from paying 2.82 a share in a yearly dividend and cut that to zero. They recently reinstated the dividend but at 1.00 per share in a yearly dividend. WMT should have suspended theirs also but when you have the Walton's controlling the company because they have so many shares, I suspect the CEO is nothing but their puppet and if he had even mentioned suspending the dividend he most likely would have been gone immediately. That is why you will never have a really good CEO running WMT because any really good CEO would never take a job like the WMT CEO job where they would basically be a CEO puppet because they will run their company properly and smartly. In the past year, WMT stock price has increased 30% while KSS stock price has increased 325%.

351,"My next Pure Earnings Short Sell play is going to be WMT. Later today I will be Selling Short a lot of WMT shares, specifically to hold through her earnings release scheduled for pre-market tomorrow? I expect weak and disappointing EPS/Revenue/Guidance, to result in a sell-off tomorrow. I am not expecting a huge drop in share price, but I think 3-6% is likely, and it could be more if there is an actual miss of consensus estimates on either EPS or Revenue, along with lowered Guidance, which I think is more likely than not. Why did I choose WMT as the single BEST Pure Earnings Short Sell trade of the day? Here is my analysis:1: Stock is significantly over-valued. I judge current Fair Value at $125. 2: Bullish analysts have helped drive the share price up despite lack of underlying financial strength.3: Overall financials are simply average, nothing stands out, nothing to justify the high P/E Ratio. 4: Jim Walton himself, and other family members, have been selling hundreds of millions of dollars worth of shares in recent months. 5: Company is very heavily dependent upon its retail stores for sales and revenue, more so than other retail giants. Example: WMT has approximately 11,400 retail stores. Target has 1,897. 6: Because WMT caters to the lowest socio-economic class in america, it will remain dependent upon foot traffic, more so than all other retail giants. Many of its customers do not own real computers, only cell phones, which makes online shopping more difficult and cumbersome. 7: Wage increases, lack of quality workers, and inflation are already and will continue to put heavy pressure on profit margins, most especially given the company dependency on retail stores and foot traffic. I think all of these factors will begin to put pressure on the stock price as of tomorrow, with the release of earnings and an update of forward Guidance. I think the odds of WMT moving higher in price tomorrow are very low, making this an outstanding Pure Earnings Short Sell play. I am NOT expecting a huge win of 10-25% price collapse here. But the Risk/Reward ratio of going Short is just really excellent, even if the win only ends up being in the 3-6% range, which I think is most likely.",0.9949

The one they are closing is Arvest and since Arvest is owned by a Walton, WMT could easily get out of the lease.

People are spending on groceries what they used to spend going out to eat. I know groceries are a low margin item and expenses will be way up, but the market will like the revenue number because it will mean there is such a great cash flow. One store here is starting to get back to normal. Instead of only one big door open they have the others and you can basically shop as you always did. I know I am suffering withdrawal from not going in the store so when my new pond pump is delivered to the store, I am going to go do ""major shopping"". I think most women are in the same camp. Even if you don't need clothes, that never stopped a woman from buying something new to wear. Anyway, WMT is going to survive and I am certainly not ever selling any of my shares. This Pandemic will have brought more shoppers to WMT.

There is not a lot of profit in giving these vaccines and when they go to where the recipients are instead of the recipients coming to them they probably lose money doing it but in a time of great need, they stepped up to the plate anyway and did what was right. I hope all these seniors appreciate what they've done and reciprocate by giving them their business, both prescription and otherwise. CVS and Walmart in our area didn't go out and do that.

489,"The post position draws for the Kentucky Derby have been made. My pick, ROCK YOUR WORLD starting from the 15 post position and is the second favorite on the morning line at 5-1. Essential Quality is the morning line favorite at 2-1 and will be right next door, breaking from the 14 post position. I would have rather had a post of 9 or 10 but 15 is just fine with the very long run to the first turn and it allows the jockey to pick the spot he would like to be in and it sure beats the 1 or 2 post position where it is so easy to get pinched in in the Kentucky Derby. I still think that ROCK YOUR WORLD will end up at 7-2 or 4-1 odds but you never know. The horse is not getting nearly the respect he deserves from all the pundits. I think he is a great horse and could easily turn into a super horse. In my opinion, he is a better horse than Essential Quality, the favorite. The only negatives if you have to search for any is he's inexperienced with only three races under his belt and he was still green in his last race and the other being the trainer who is John Sherriffs who is a very good trainer but has had a really hard time producing winners when he ships his horses outside of California but he did finally win the Breeders Cup Classic so maybe that will break his bad shipping record. As I said, ROCK YOUR WORLD WAS still green in his last race and in fact changed leads three times in the stretch which is unheard of but he still ran a stellar race going away at the end. Ideally I would have liked him to have one more race under his belt going into the derby but it is what it is. The fact that he ran so green last race yet still was very impressive is why I think this horse could be a super horse. Changing leads is something that trainers teach horses. The idea is that on the front and back stretch you lead with your right leg and in the turns you lead with your left leg. This helps preserve the horses energy. Hopefully they've been able to work with him and teach him the proper way since his last race. Some horses just won't do it though. There have been a few really great horses in the past that refused to change leads their entire career yet turned out to be great champions. Anyway, I'm putting big bucks on this horse and am hoping for a price like his morning line of 5-1. That would be an amazing gift wrapped up with a giant bow. Wish us luck.",0.9996

Investopedia...... So, corporations then pay a tax based on that profit. and often theywill pay a dividend & the dividend is not a 'cost' to a company, "" it is a distribution from profits to stakeholders for providing capital."" ditto for taxes which are in reality also a "".. not a cost to a company. It is a distribution out of profits. That puts tax in the same category as a dividend - it is a return to the stakeholders in the enterprise. This reflects the fact that companies do not make profit merely by using investors' capital. They also use the societies in which they operate, whether that is the physical infrastructure provided by the state, the people the state has educated, or the legal infrastructure that allows companies to protect their property rights. Tax is the return due on this investment by society from which companies benefit."" Richard Murphy, economist & professor",0.9695

Since I live in Rogers, AR, (where the first store was), I would drive past it and the parking lot was always full, and I told my husband we should buy the stock and he said it was too high. In those days it would trade in the 30's and rise up to about 60 and then split. Well, after saying that for about 2 years, he finally gave in and we bought some shares and in future years added as we had money. We were poor in those days but he had a gov. job and I taught school. WMT was next to a grocery store and I would shop in the grocery store (because wmt didn't have groceries then) and then I would go to WMT. We also had another discount store called Gibson's down the street and I would sometimes go there, but Gibson''s eventually closed up and after we bought WMT stock, I would always buy everything I could from there. We had a baby and a 4 year old so I could find lots of items I needed at WMT. The rest is history. WMT goes to the grave with us now. Our cost basis is too low to make selling an option. It will still be the best thing I ever bought. It just keeps on giving. The first store has now moved down the street quite a few blocks and is a supercenter and the old store number 1 is a flea market. The number 2 store is in Harrison, AR, and it is a very busy store, too. When I am going camping in that area, we always stop in there.

I quit betting any tracks in Kentucky but I'm going to make an exception and make a big bet his year because it is not very often that I get really excited about a Derby horse but I am this year. In recent history there were only two horses that I was really excited about and made big bets on. That was Big Brown in 2008 and California Chrome in 2014. I've found another one to get really excited about. My pick this year for a big bet is ROCK YOUR WORLD. They brought him along slowly and I like that and he looks like the real deal and a super horse plus he has everything you could ask for. He has great cruising speed, he is bred for distance and he is a push button horse where all you have to do is ask him in the stretch and he finds another gear. He has the stamina for the 1-1/4 mile because he is out of the sire Candy Ride and him dam is out of Empire Maker. The only horse I can see that might worry me is Concert Tour who will be running next Saturday in the Arkansas Derby. He has been impressive but he has to prove to me to still be improving in that race and I doubt he will do enough to change my mind. The only other possible super horse I saw this year was Life Is Good and he got injured and will need minor surgery so his is out of the Derby. Essential Quality was and still may be the favorite to win but believe me, he is not in the same class as Rock Your World but I'm hoping he will stay the favorite so our price will be higher. So get ready to make your bets and I will let you know if anything happens Saturday in the Arkansas Derby that will change my mind. That is the last major prep race before the Derby. One other thing is that Rock Your World ran his first two races on turf and the last race on dirt and like his daddy Candy Ride, it looks like he can and loves to run on anything and I have no worry if the track ends up sloppy or muddy because being a chip off the old block, I'm sure he can run on anything, just like his daddy who puts out of lot of horses who are great off track horses.",0.9996

All it will take is ONE sign of weakness, be it poor EPS, poor Revenue, or poor Guidance, and I see WMT taking a plunge of 3-6% tomorrow. Of course if the earning release is poor on multiple levels, we could see a much more severe price correction. The point is, I think this is a very safe and conservative Short Sell play, offering a 75-80% chance of success, meaning I Cover tomorrow with some type of profit. Good Luck!",0.9366

That is flat scary. I have said before that we have quit buying stocks until something is settled about the stepped up basis. But if the stepped up basis goes away, I figure the bank account accountability will also be done. BECAUSE, people will be trying to squirrel away some of their assets. I have said before that we get about 105k a year in dividends, well, that will not stay in our brokerage accounts. I will have it transferred into checking and then I will go draw it out in cash and distribute it to my children and grandchildren and instruct them not to deposit it, but to use it to pay for their daily living and let their income stay in the bank. My kids all have a safe too, so what they don't use just squirrel it away. We can hope that these events don't happen and I will also start giving away 15k a year and my husband will do the same to each relative so that when we expire, the gains won't be taxed and the kids can live off the income they produce. I am paranoid on this subject. So sorry if I irritate people on the board. But when you get old and the rules of the game change towards the end of the game, it is devastating to your plan for your children and grandchildren. I can tell how much we have in the market on line, because you are anonymous but when you hope to pass on 5.6 million and now realize most of it will be taxed because of socialists, it is disturbing to say the least.

By bullets? By bombs? By nooses? No, by requiring a free ID to secure the vote. Let me say that again: by requiring a free ID to secure the vote. How absolutely preposterous.Am I to believe that black Americans who have overcome the atrocities of slavery, who were victorious in the civil rights movement, and now sit in the highest levels of this government could not figure out how to get a free ID to secure their votes? That they need to be coddled by politicians because they don’t think we can figure out how to make our voices heard?Are you kidding me? The notion that people must be protected from a free ID to secure their votes is not just insane—it is insulting.And let me tell you something about this. This doesn’t have anything to do with justice, this has everything to do with power.Just a few days ago, the vice president went to the very place that I mentioned, the Woolworth counter in Greensboro, but you know who wasn’t there, you know who wasn’t invited? My good friend, Clarence Henderson, who is a civil rights icon. He sat at that counter and endured the suffering and pain to make sure that black voices were heard. And why was he left out? Because he’s of a different political persuasion.You might ask why this is so, and I’ll tell you plainly. The goal of some individuals in government is not to hear the voices of black Americans at all, it’s to hear the voices that fit their narratives and ultimately help keep power with one group. And that’s what this all is all about, it’s about power.Just look at HR 1. It’s despicable. The entire thing is designed to keep one party in power and ensure they stay there indefinitely. And how do they plan to do that? By taking away the rights of states given by the Constitution to govern their own elections, to mandate a partisan wish list that comes down from that federal government.Some of these items include using government dollars to fund campaigns in order to give an advantage to one party; mandating that felons are allowed to vote, including illegal immigrants on voter rolls; and of course, trying to ban states from having voter ID.The last thing I’ll say is this, many people know that I’m a strong proponent of the Second Amendment, and I always will be. I believe that the right to keep and bear arms should always be available to law-abiding citizens, but the first line of defense in maintaining the integrity of the Second Amendment is having an ID to show when requiring that ID when you purchase that firearm.In the same way, I believe that voter ID is our first line of defense for protecting the integrity of the right to vote. And that’s what this should be about. It should be about integrity, not power. Thank you.”",0.9991

HERE....................On another note, if anyone has a college student about to graduate with a business major or someone graduating with a masters, this area has the vendors who serve WMT.

Once you get a job with a vendor-- like Colgate, PG, Clorox, and a gazillion others and have been there a short while, the head hunters start calling you to get you to transfer to another vendor and the salary will always be at least 10k higher and sometimes much higher.--- But you don't want to change too many times or you get to be known as a job hopper. An example-- I have a very close relative who started with one company and stayed quite a few years and worked up to VP of one area of the company and when some changes were coming a headhunter called and she was offered a job at another with 50k to change. That person retired at 49 and has a nice pension. Also, this area is offering 10k and a bicycle to people to move here. I can't explain that. It is a mystery to me, but the 10k is paid out in a monthly thing after you show your lease or your mortgage. You have to be accepted for that, but I have no clue about it. I am only mentioning that because some college students graduate and spend time looking for a job and get frustrated.

Without Obamacare, people with pre-existing conditions will have no insurance or the only insurance that would be available to them would be insurance that 95% of Americans could not afford to pay for. To add to the disaster that it would be, there are now over 10 million Americans that have contracted Covid19 and that number may well double or more. Those people and any of you that are unlucky enough to catch it will now have pre-existing conditions as far as health insurers are concerned. According to the Mayo Clinic, the long term effects of some people who have had the virus are heart problems, lung problem, brain problems, blood clots, PTSD and they admit that there could well be other problems that we as of yet don't know about. Health insurers won't want anything to do with these people. Republicans will sometimes say they are in favor of no one being denied insurance because they have a pre-existing condition but they never will commit to limiting the amount insurance companies can charge those people with pre-existing conditions and leave that up to the health insurers. So when an insurance company doesn't want to cover someone because they are a risk, all they have to do is charge someone 3,000 per month for insurance or 4,000 or 5,000 or whatever.

The whole thing was basically being run by the national guard except for the people administering the shots and the people in the observation area where you go for 15 minutes after you get the shot and those people looks for people with symptoms and go around asking people if they are experiencing any side affects. Except for those two areas, the whole thing was run by the national guard from guiding people where to park to telling them when they should enter the building to carrying in more boxes of vaccine when needed from a large supply that was stored outside by the entrance door to making sure everyone entering had masks and the proper paper work to manning all the stations that you go to where they would again scan your paperwork and tell you where to proceed to next. A couple things I wanted to say about the military working there. There seemed to be way more military people there than was needed but better too many than not enough. I interacted with probably ten to twelve of these military people and I want to say that every one of these people were extremely nice and friendly and very helpful. They did a fantastic job of running the show and it was very organized and I tip my hat to them for the job that they did. Glad to see our military is in such good hands. One more thing is the side affects from the vaccine. You hear a lot about the side affects but after almost 24 hours, all we have is a slightly sore arm when moved in the wrong position but very mild pain and I know a lot of people that have gotten the vaccine and the only side affects we've heard of are sore arms. I didn't see anyone in the observation area with any side affects when we were there. I know some people have some rather strong side affects from the vaccine but from what I can tell, it is pretty rare so don't let the fear of side affects stop you from getting the vaccine so we can all do our part to help put an end to it and get all our lives back to normal.",0.9985

Suddenly, in the afternoon session on Wednesday, before the House Intelligence Committee, Robert Mueller sharpened up his answers and we learned many details on the actual ratfcking that we didn’t know before. We also learned that the president*’s having been compromised by his dealings with Russia is not yet out of the question.

The Background: Arizona passed an election integrity law prohibiting outside private funding for their elections, thereby banning billionaires from influencing Arizonan politics. In 2020, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and his wife Priscilla Chan, spent nearly half a billion dollars in various states to fund election efforts. They spent at least $5 million in the state of Arizona. Democrats in Arizona, such as State Senator Juan Mendez (D-Tempe), claim that their state needs outside funding to run elections. Mendez stated, “It’s easy to make a boogeyman out of billionaires. … But...our elections are so underfunded we’ve got counties out there asking for money to do voter outreach.” However, this leaves room for outside influences, such as wealthy billionaires, to unfairly influence the political trajectory of a state.Rep. Jake Hoffman (R-AZ) stated, “The passage and signing of House Bill 2569 makes Arizona the first in the nation to fully ban billionaires from influencing the administration and management of Arizona elections.” Heritage Action Director Jessica Anderson stated, “Arizonans deserve an election process free from outside influence and partisan funding — by banning corporate and private funding for election operations, this law will safeguard that system.”",0.9685

Disney Plus is worth at least 3 billion USD (Profit after revenue). So I would suggest the group bid of 20 to 30 billion USD is completely reasonable as long as Walmart/Microsoft have content already lined up.

With all the mass shootings in the US in recent weeks, months, years, do we make it harder to purchase a weapon or what? That hasn't worked for Mexico. My husband and I live there every winter. Americans are told not to visit Mexico because of all the violence. Mexico recorded 29,168 homicides in 2017. It's nearly impossible to buy a gun LEGALLY in Mexico, yet more people have been killed by guns than ever. How does that make sense? My thoughts? Laws are for law abiding citizens, that's the problem.The ONE and ONLY gun shop in all of Mexico is behind a fortress-like wall on a heavily guarded military base.To enter the Directorate of Arms and Munitions Sales, customers must undergo months of background checks — six documents are required — and then be frisked by uniformed soldiers. Like the 2nd Amendment in the United States, Mexico’s Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms, but it also stipulates that federal law “will determine the cases, conditions, requirements and places” of gun ownership. Each day that ONE and ONLY army gun store sells on average just 38 firearms to civilians, while an estimated 580 weapons are smuggled into Mexico from the United States.My thoughts, no matter how many laws the US makes, remember, laws are for law abiding citizens.

HERE.......................Now that the stimulus is passed, all Democrats eyes are salivating on how much they can raise taxes on anyone who has done well and worked hard to give it to those who prefer not to work and rely on mailbox money (and you know who they are). I remember when Obamacare was passed, my son and daughter-in-law made huge salaries working for their companies (they were both VP's for Fortune 500 companies and both had a master's degree to help them get to that spot) and when they picked up their taxes from the accountant, they were sick. Obamacare cost them a fortune to pay for those who don't like to work. My son-in-law's clinic also had a few tales about people coming in (that were young) and didn't have a job, but they had Obamacare and wanted to know what all could they get for free. They couple I am talking about had just taken off about 4 days to go to a music concert someplace. Who knows how they paid for that. So, now with the Democrats in power again, we are going to soak those who have worked hard and do well to support the slugs. Disgusting to me to say the least. If you don't educate yourself and don't get a skill, you are the problem. Anyway, my son and daughter-in-law decided to give up their very profitable jobs because they had saved a lot and invested wisely and retired because why give so much to the government to support those who don't care to work hard and get somewhere in life.",0.9911

If you don't have a portfolio, you will never have wealth unless you inherit it, win the lottery, or buy real estate and wait for appreciation but with real estate you almost have to sell the whole thing to get money out. With stocks, you can sell a few shares at a time. I have taught my grandchildren well on how to invest. One will never forget one lesson. He was trying to win a stock picking contest at school and was in 2nd place, and I told him we had to buy the high fliers and it wasn't good investing, but to win the contest we were taking chances. Well, after looking in IBD and researching some, we picked a Chinese stock. The thing went up like a rocket and then Muddy Waters guy came on CNBC and told why he was shorting it and the rest is history. The contest finished with him way down close to the bottom. It was a great lesson in buying what you know at affordable prices. You grow wealthy slowly. That same grandson will graduate in May with a degree in computer stuff-- software engineer and has a job offer with a signing bonus and he has a portfolio already of almost 50k with money from summer jobs and he has part of that in a Roth.

3469,"“In the beginning of March, April, we saw a tremendous outbound migration. About over 400,000 people left Manhattan, 40% of the occupants, essentially,” Jonathan Miller, CEO of appraisal firm Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers & Consultants, which prepared the report for New York City residential brokerage Douglas Elliman, told Yahoo Finance. Renters in Manhattan “became first-time buyers, they lived with relatives, they rented — they did anything but come into the city,” he said. As landlords scrambled to recover losses, empty apartment listings poured on real estate sites like Zillow. In July, there were 21.6% more apartments on the market from only a month prior in June — and 121% more compared to July 2019. “Right now, we have the highest amount of vacancy in at least the 14 years of history I have on this metric in the city,” said Miller, who said that though more renters signed leases in July compared to June, there were 57% fewer leases signed than in July 2019.Low demand has driven rent prices down 7.6%",0.7902

Fogarty, USA TODAY 2004In a bid to boost minority homeownership, President Bush will ask Congress for authority to eliminate the down-payment requirement for Federal Housing Administration loans.In announcing the plan Monday at a home builders show in Las Vegas, Federal Housing Commissioner John Weicher called the proposal the ""most significant FHA initiative in more than a decade."" It would lead to 150,000 first-time owners annually, he said.Nothing-down options are available on the private mortgage market, but, in general, they require the borrower to have pristine credit. Bush's proposed change would extend the nothing-down option to borrowers with blemished credit.The FHA isn't a direct lender, but guarantees loan payments for mortgages on moderately priced owner-occupied property. The FHA guarantee now permits private lenders to finance as much as 97% of the purchase price of a home for millions of low- and middle-income borrowers.In the proposal soon to be delivered to Congress, Bush would allow the FHA to guarantee loans for the full purchase price of the home, plus down-payment costs.

The data suggest that both medical and non-medical facemasks are ineffective to block human-to-human transmission of viral and infectious disease such SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, supporting against the usage of facemasks. Wearing facemasks has been demonstrated to have substantial adverse physiological and psychological effects. These include hypoxia, hypercapnia, shortness of breath, increased acidity and toxicity, activation of fear and stress response, rise in stress hormones, immunosuppression, fatigue, headaches, decline in cognitive performance, predisposition for viral and infectious illnesses, chronic stress, anxiety and depression. Long-term consequences of wearing facemask can cause health deterioration, developing and progression of chronic diseases and premature death.
