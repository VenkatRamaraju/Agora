At least not like it's being portrayed here. My opinion, it creates somewhat of a facade. EPS will LOOK better because there will be less shares. The market cap will remain the same. Dividends will be greater on shares held, only the investor will have less shares, so the end result (yield) will remain the same.

133,"Reverse Split Advantages for GEThe move wouldn’t directly change the value of the company or an investor’s position, but it would shrink the number of shares outstanding to about 1.1 billion.In theory, a company’s share price in and of itself doesn’t matter—its total value can be divided by any number of shares.But some investors avoid shares below certain thresholds, and some stock exchanges require companies to keep share prices above certain levels: $1 on the Nasdaq, for example. Some institutional investors won’t invest in companies with stock prices below certain levels.Practically speaking, investors often seem to see higher-priced shares as more attractive—and companies with prices below certain thresholds, like $10 or $1, as shakier. In the market, of course, perception matters.",0.9899

146,"Haven't looked at GE for 6 months and I see it has risen to nosebleed altitude.With the National debt now at 108% of GDP, it can never be paid off , because if you even took 10% of the GDP out of the economy per year to pay it off over 10 years, the economy would implode. In fact they have been borrowing more to support the economy. The inexorable rise in the debt is shown here:https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/government-debt-to-gdpThe only solution is to inflate it away which means letting the buying power of the dollar tank.By contrast the debt to GDP ratios of most countries is far lower: Russia 14% ; Sweden 35% Germany 49% etc. France is 116% so forget that! Japan 237% forget that!You need to not hold dollars or yen but be invested in productive capacity that will hold its value. Also, a significant part of your investment should be outside the US and I have liked Sweden and done well in Swedish stocks traded in the Nasdaq Stockholm for the last 30 years precisely due to their low national debt.

156,"The comments from Dragos are the best I have received on the board. I was thinking of just leaving this board - too many hecklers and uninformed postings. But it is refreshing to have a serious discussion, so here is my answer...Nelson Peltz, head of T Rowe Price and a very shrew and ruthless investor, was Larry Culp's roommate in College (my memory). He knew Culp well and had admired the Danaher progress and turn around for 15 years starting around 2000. Nelson Peltz's fund T Rowe Price has the largest GE Position today at 7.6% with 9 billion shares. The next largest GE stockholder is Vangard at 6.94 % and then Fidelity at 4.3% and finally Blackrock at 4%.Not one of these three funds would touch GE with a stick if they were not rock hard solid in support. All are the best shrewdist investors in the stock market.The story is that when times at GE were so bad - Peltz locked himself into a room for a weekend and thought long and hard about GE. He decided to gamble and increase his GE investment, adding to the extremely higher quantity one owned now. Ed Gardner on the GE Board is the second top person at T Rowe Price. Your comments on Culp refusing at first and then coming on the GE Board and only agreeing when he had full support is the same one I know. They had to pay Culp a lot of money to intice him ($240 million challenge he will meet), since he was retired from Danafer and teaching business at Harvard and enjoying the less pressured life. Culp was admired in 2015 and well acknowledged and certainly had lots od Danafer money (stocks, options, and pay) over 15 years.He saw something clearly in the GE future and he is playing it out. I think the Biopharma sale was incredibly clever. The GECAS will also be incredibly clever. The reverse 8:1 split will clean up a real price problem. Do not expect dividends soon, and the mergers will be smaller and slower and better thought out with some of the finest minds looking at them.I have watched GE since 1970's and never bought. It was way overpriced for me and not run well under Jack Welch. Reminded me of Rudy Gulianti. I never bought GE but I watched for ""someday"" maybe....But when I saw the $5.98 price last August-September I could not resist. At first it was a struggle but I bought a very large position and knew the vaccine would change everything. It has. I did not know that much abut Culp except his gamble for $16.64 stock price to get his $240 million bonus - but once I watched him and looked back at his history, I knew very few could do what he is doing. It is remarkable. I admire a CEO that can drive up stock prices by achievements.It is offensive to see posters on this board shooting off what they know little about. Anti comments like reverse stock splits and Culp's large payment and all that junk is just demeaning. I won't go into that part but I can tell you if they knew the deep roots GE has worldwide they would also stand in awe. They are everywhere and in everything. They built 37% general aviation engines and 27% military engines and produced 66% of all jet engines on this planet. Incredible position. Amazing....Like you I am wondering on why GE was factoring because they should have been cash strong by now. I am totally in favor of stopping factoring and it is my take that the financial numbers coming out are way undervalued while Culp and team go deeper into the restructuring of General Electric.I am not a cheerleader. I am simply a realist that has a lot at stake. One click and I could sell all my position (stock and call options) and be retired for life over their progress so far.

But by the Q4 results you can bank on it that GE stock will definitely be far higher than it is todayFor the Q1 pricing I thing $15 a share is extremely likely….But here is what you need to think about going forward….if you believe all the GE News of breakthrough medical scanning devices (MRI, sonic, kidney detectors, etc)If you believe all the news that GE is rebuilding power plants using much more environmentally sensitive equipment (Pueblo, Nepal, Rocky Reach Dam, Washington State) and other places If you believe that GE has lead US new renewables for the past 2 years and is the winner in Oklahoma, Martha’s Vineyard, New Jersey, Dogger Bank, Spain, Turkey, Viet Nam) and other placesIf you believe that GE Offshore is leading and Vestas and Siemens are only announcing but GE is actually installing large Offshore Wind turbines in many places (Dogger, Martha’s Vineyard, New Jersey, Denmark), andIf you believe that GE will get a decent part of the new Biden environmental energy money to enlarge their future profits, andIf you believe that the US licensing Wind turbines will now be expedited and fossil fuels will be de-emphasized, andIf you believe aviation is rapidly coming back fast and toward past numbers and is now at least at 60% of normal - but headed to maybe 80% of normal by the end of this year, andIf you believe that the airlines are buyig new planed using the new GE 9X engines (Max, Southwest Airlines 100 plane order, Alaska Airlines 23 plane order) and more, andIf you thing divesting GE Capital of GECAS to AerCap was a smart deal, and If you think reducing the GE payroll in 2 years from 330,000 to 150,000 employees, andIf you think taking debt over the past 2 years from $120 billion headed to $25 billion by another year or so, andIf you think funding the GE Pension from 70% two years ago to at least 82% presently, andIf you think energizing the remaining work force with new enthusiasm and better work results will make a difference …. And lastlyIf you believe Larry Culp holds his cards close to the vest and traditionally announces better results than they predicted This is an exercise in patience – which most people have little of todayWhat is important is you look at the almost daily announcements on new contracts, technology, changers in the actual company for the better, and all that.You must see clearly that there is no logical reason that GE will not advance this year.

258,"THE “BOARD SHOULD BE SHOT”: LARRY CULP’S PANDEMIC-YEAR STOCK DEAL IS PUTTING GE IN THE HOT SEATWhen Equilar, the executive compensation experts, published its annual list in April of CEOs of public companies with the highest compensation for 2020, there was a surprising name at the top of the list: Larry Culp, the chairman and CEO of GE. Equilar listed Culp’s compensation at about $72.7 million, up 208% from the year before. Equilar’s calculation appeared to include the value of $57.1 million for a contingent stock grant that the GE board of directors awarded Culp last August. That stock grant has turned out to be worth a lot more than $57.1 million. Four months later, in December, the GE stock price rose sufficiently from August for Culp to get an award of about 4.65 million shares, now worth about $60.5 million. Then, on May 7, as a result of a further rise in GE’s stock, Culp received an additional approximately 4.65 million GE shares, worth another roughly $60.5 million. For those keeping score, that’s some $120 million worth of GE stock for Culp since August. What’s more, the stock has barely budged since Culp took over GE in October 2018, when it was around $12.40 per share. Nowadays, the stock is around $13 a share, or up about 5%, at a time when the Dow Jones Industrial Average, of which GE was once the longest-tenured component, has risen some 28%.

(NYSE:GE) announced on Wednesday its partnership with Ares Management Corporation (NYSE:ARES) has been updated to include a 302MW agreement with Lincoln Land Wind. The deal, which will be completed by year-end 2021, includes 107 GE 2.82-127 turbines and a 20-year full-service agreement.Over the past 12 months, General Electric and Ares Management have announced over 800MW together as the companies work to transition toward sustainable and renewable energy.Also on Wednesday, Barclays raised its price target on General Electric to $16 and maintained an overweight rating.General Electric’s stock had a 136% meteoric rise between October 2020 and March 2021 and has since traded sideways in consolidation. General Electric’s daily trading range is tightening, however, and could be getting ready for another big move.The GE Chart: Over the course of the last two months, General Electric’s daily trading range has become smaller and on Thursday GE only fluctuated 19 cents – between $12.92 and $13.11. GE has been trading in a sideways channel above a support level at $12.90 and below a resistance level at $13.79GE's stock is being held down by both the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA) and the 21-day EMA. The eight-day EMA is also trending slightly below the 21-day EMA which is bearish. GE is trading well above the 200-day simple moving average, however, which indicates overall sentiment in the stock is bullish.Bulls want to see GE's stock regain the eight-day and 21-day EMAs as support. If GE can pop over its EMAs, it has room to move back up to the $13.80 level. If it could regain that level as support it could move toward the $15 mark which is resistance from back in 2018.Bears want to see the eight-day and 21-day EMAs continue to push GE's stock down until it loses support at $12.90.

387,"Something the market seems to be overlooking is that GE was expected to sell the leasing unit for about $30 billion with terms unknown (maybe deferred). So, an okay to moderate deal was priced into the stock. However, what was announced this morning was a significantly better deal. The leasing unit was sold at around $50 billion in value -- $26 billion in cash, upfront (which is a lot better than $30 on ""terms""), and the rest in stock in the new company.GE stock should be up by at least a dollar a share based on that news, maybe $1.50 at least during the day, with a close at $15. This drop has all to do with the reverse split which demonstrates how retail investors don't like that move. I think it's wrong but it's not $1.80 per current share wrong. Institutions are smart enough to know this and I suspect they are buying and will continue to buy because this is a short term opportunity to get the shares on sale. Plus, the leasing co sale was far better than expected.I'm going out on a limb here and calling the stock to rally back and close the week at $15 or better.Go, GE!Good luck, longs.",0.9882

425,"A REVERSE SPLIT = A REVERSAL OF FORTUNEA reverse split is a sign of a shrinking company. Eight to nine billion shares is way to much for the much smaller GE of the future. It has been my experience that in the vast majority of cases where the company has instituted a reverse split the stock declined before the reverse split and for some time after the reverse split. In many cases, the post reverse split shares declined by as much as 70% to 80%. Also, companies that declared reverse splits often register shelf offering to raise capital at the new higher price thus diluting the effect of the reverse split . GE HAS MASSIVE DEBT AND IS MOST LIKELY THE REASON FOR THE REVERSE SPLIT! Many companies that declare reverse splits declare chapter 11 because of the onerous pressures that required management to declare a reverse split in the first place. It is my experience that at the very best it takes a company many years to recover from a reverse split. A reverse split company is more likely to file chapter 11 than it is to survive and in my view GE is no exception.IN MY OPINION A REVERSE SPLIT IS ""NEVER"" A GOOD THING FOR SHAREHOLDERS!!!",0.9227

429,"This is a story about GE, That doesn't talk about shr. price ,dividend,or earnings.this is the story about GE ENGINES.Part 1From the turbosupercharger to the world's most powerful commercial jet engine, GE's history of powering the world's aircraft features more than 100 years of innovation.GE Aviation: Powering a Century of FlightWhen the United States entered World War I in 1917, the U.S. government searched for a company to develop the first airplane engine ""booster"" for the fledgling U.S. aviation industry. This booster, or turbosupercharger, installed on a piston engine, used the engine's exhaust gases to drive an air compressor to boost power at higher altitude.GE accepted the challenge first, but another team also requested the chance to develop the turbosupercharger. Contracts were awarded in what was the first military aircraft engine competition in the U.S. Under wartime secrecy, both companies tested and developed various designs until the Army called for a test demonstration.In the bitter atmosphere of Pikes Peak, 14,000 feet above sea level, GE demonstrated a 350-horsepower, turbosupercharged Liberty aircraft engine and entered the business of making airplanes fly higher, faster and with more efficiency than ever before. That mountaintop test of the first turbosupercharger landed GE's first aviation-related government contract and paved the way for GE to become a world leader in jet engines.For more than two decades, GE produced turbosuperchargers that enabled aircraft, including many in service during World War II, to fly higher, with heavier payloads. The company's expertise in turbines and turbosuperchargers figured into the U.S. Army Air Force's decision to select GE to develop the nation's first jet engine.Since then, the aircraft engines division of GE Aviation has scored many firsts. Among them: America's first jet engine, the first turbojet engines to power flights at two and three times the speed of sound, and the world's first high bypass turbofan engine to enter service.Today, GE Aviation is a global provider of engines, systems, and services, with revenues exceeding $30 billion. As a leader in aviation technology, GE Aviation continues to design, develop and manufacture jet engines, components and integrated systems for military, commercial and business and general aircraft as well as aero-derivative gas turbines for marine applications. In addition, GE Aviation is the world's leading integrated engine maintenance resource.GE Builds America's First Jet EngineBecause principles and challenges in turbosuperchargers apply to gas turbines as well, GE was a logical choice to build America's first jet engine.In 1941, the U.S. Army Air Corps picked GE's Lynn, Massachusetts, plant to build a jet engine based on the design of Britain's Sir Frank Whittle. Six months later, on April 18, 1942, GE engineers successfully ran the I-A engine.In October 1942, at Muroc Dry Lake, California, two I-A engines powered the historic first flight of a Bell XP-59A Airacomet aircraft, launching the United States into the Jet Age. The thrust rating of the I-A was 1,250 pounds; the thrust rating of the GE90-115B is more than 90 times as great at 115,000 pounds.The I-A engine incorporated a centrifugal-flow compressor, as did the increasingly more powerful engines developed by GE during the next two years, culminating in the J33 engine, which was rated at 4,000 pounds of thrust. The J33 powered the U.S. Army Air Corps' first operational jet fighter, the P-80 Shooting Star, to a world's speed record of 620 miles per hour in 1947. Before the end of that year, a GE J35 engine powered a Douglas D-558-1 Skystreak to a record-breaking 650 miles per hour. The J35 was the first GE turbojet engine to incorporate an axial-flow compressor--the type of compressor used in all GE engines since then.However, the Air Corps, concerned about disrupting supplies of turbosuperchargers, placed production of GE's jet engines with other manufacturers. GE then set about designing another. The resulting J47 put GE back in the business of building jet engines. But demand for the J47 to power almost all the new front-line military aircraft, particularly the F-86 Sabre Jet, meant the Lynn plant could not keep up. GE needed a second factory.GE selected a federally owned plant near Cincinnati, Ohio, where Wright Aeronautical piston engines had been produced during World War II. GE formally opened the plant on February 28, 1949, with the second J47 production line, to complement the original line at Lynn. Later, the plant would be known as Evendale and would become GE Aviation's world headquarters.With the Korean War boosting demand, the J47 became the world's most produced gas turbine. More than 35,000 J47 engines were delivered by the end of the 1950s. That engine scored two major firsts: it was the first turbojet certified for civil use by the U.S. Civil Aeronautics Administration- and the first to use an elec",0.9989

Reverse splits are for businesses cleaning up problems which GE had plenty thus the reason for Culp, cash flow improvement, sale of assets, reduction/restructuring of debt, etc. I hope it works since I bought at $31 so I will need GE to hit $248 to get my money back. And I suffered the reduction of dividend to .01 per quarter. To say this reverse split will be good progress for current long-term shareholders in the red (probably most) is delusional. But the reverse split is a done deal. Culp would not let the item be on the docket for voting if it was not already pre-approved by the Institutional holders (the majority). I am fairly confident that I will write off my GE losses prior to full recovery from post-split stock appreciation, but such is the world of investment.

The new Wrong. GE owned 66% - BH stockholders owned 34% The BHGE benefits went down severely and quickly. BHGE company was a wild bet that oil would go up to $60 a barrel and all would be good.The deal was severely criticized at that time by many. The BH stock was $33 on October 2016. GE stock was at $22.3. John Flaherty came in replacing Jeff Immelt. Immelt had been there for 15 years doing 2-3 deals mergers per year - many losers.Frankly no serious stockholder would have stuck it out. Things went south. Lots of problems in 2018 and 2019. Flaherty got fired in the fall of 2018. Culp was hired. In Q4 2019 GE reported a $2.2 billion loss on just the Baker Hughes deal. The declining 25 cents per quarter rich dividend went to 1 cent a share. GE sold in Q2 2019 more Baker stock. That sale added another $7 billion loss. So far a total loss of $9.2 billion on the BHGE deal. Another problem was the GE recorded wildly wrong goodwill on their statement. In 2018 they claimed $52 billion goodwill, 47% of which was the BHGE ownership. Wrong again. GE was desperate and faced collapse.The Baker deal was just the last of many failed deals. Culp has changed that and under-reported his successes. He is seriously reducing and removing all the bad parts of GE. The AERCAP deal was exceptional and sharply contrasted the failed GEBH 2017 deal. Culp should take the company back to its past successes if: 1) the ECONOMY rebounds (air travel mostly)2) the DOUBTERS JUST EVAPORATE (a lot of them playing on this board)3) TIME heals GE and all its worth returns.4) RENEWABLES contribute mightedly as it now seems to be unstoppable5) most optimistic things happen like renewing the GRID (GE has 1/3rd of the Grid using their equipment)6) Culp is LEFT ALONE to make sensible, strategic deals.

With that will come more travel and a boost to GEs aviation. GE has a lot of potential to be a very big winner this year. Proven CEO, Name recognition, still attractive stock price for the retail investor. Not many companies out there that are this large with an entry price below just above $10/share.

Having one ten dollar bill or ten one dollar bills is exactly the same thing - ten dollars... A reverse split lessens the shares available, but they become 8 times more valuable in price..When GE cuts the outstanding shares to 1/8th - there will only be 1.1 billion shares out now. It gets rid of a lot of dollar stock buyers who now have to spend $100 instead of $12.50 buying GE.That moves the kind of people who buy General Electric into a much higher class of investor who have serious money with serious commitments. There will be a lot less day trading and far lower volume daily. That is terrific because 5-6% stock price moves are a real ouch. Today the stock moved almost 3% and nothing was actually happening. We really need to wait 2 weeks for Q1 earnings.People spending $100 a share on GE have more money to spend. It eliminates the one or two or three shares buyer at $12.50 a share.I voted for the RS gladly. All the bigger investors will definitely support the reverse split - so nothing on this board can really change the obvious outlook.In a year look back and if GE was headed to $20 - it will be $160 instead. It does not change the direction of the stock - just the amount of shares out.Reverse splits DO NOT CHANGE THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUE of the company.Performance does - not stock price.It is simply a cleaning up of the stock.I believe it actually will move the GE stock price up - just like Apple at $20 (now $126) has done or Costco at $40 (now $350) has done over the years.",0.9968

Or that GE has its hands in 50% of all the power on this planet!O that the Martin Marietta F35 state of the art military airplane relies on the GE advanced engines for huge design advances.Or that we have GE generator power plants in submarines and helicopters.Or that only Seimens and GE are the only serious competitors considered by the bigger hospitals when buying an MRI scanner.Or that I learned GE made made a zillion ventilators during the pandemic.Or that GE sells to every airline on this planet and is located in over 130 countries.GE is probably also is in touch with the same 130 countries on their power and electricity uses.These same 130 countries are buying wind and will be going to GE when it comes to offshore wine turbines.And even more astonishing to me is the 80 countries GE has manufacturing plants located in and it has offices here too. In many ways GE reminds me of the US Government. It is there a lot of places and it is more free from local politics. hey cannot afford to be taking sides on anything except to get the sales. But those countries also cannot afford to ignore GE. This is not a Nike Shoe or an AMC Movie Chain or a Disney - all companies that are in your life but none offering environment and health solutions.So when I hear a Stephen Tusa, or a John Inch, or a Chuck Watkins passing off as analysts - I am in awe of their complete stupidity. They bash GE. They say the stock is way too much. They are waiting for a ""hail Mary"" pass.GE is the 17th largest US Industrial company. The top 8 are all car companies. Three are electronics firms like Apple. The remaining 6 are Industrial companies and GE is the largest of these. GE is not broke. It has $45 BILLION in cash.. It could raise bushels of money if it wanted. And sure it has debt.. Sure in the past It has used its assets foolishly. Sure It has used factoring as a financial crutch.Sure it supported a GE Capital division that still has usefulness - but it is unwinding.General Electric is cutting overhead. It has shed 150,000 employees. They are closing redundant plants.And what does big mean. A $20 billion company is considered huge. The stock market has thousands of these companies for buying stock in. GE is 5 times larger. Any company with just RENEWABLES ($20 billion) or MEDICAL ($20 billion) or AVIATION ($32 billion and it will be back to $400 billion), or POWER ($20 billion) would by itself be vastly important.

GE will receive $24 billion in cash and stock that will give it about a 46% stake in the combined company.The company plans to use proceeds to reduce its debt load by about $30 billion, part of a multi-year effort to slash $70 billion of debt from its balance sheet. It is the latest and among the most dramatic steps GE is taking to reshape and slim down the now struggling company.GECAS, which buys aircraft and leases them to airlines and other operators, had been providing most of the revenue for the GE Capital unit. But sales fell about 20% last year as the Covid-19 pandemic caused a plunge in air travel and massive losses across the airline industry. GECAS' cash-starved airline customers paid only about 84% of the unit's invoices in 2020. It resulted in a $786 million loss for 2020 after a $1 billion profit in 2019.",-0.5966

Fourth-quarter Healthcare results were excellent, with revenues up 6% year-over-year (YoY), operating margins up 3% to 20% and strong FCF conversion. The Power and Renewables segment improved margins due to strength from gas plant services. With flight traffic increasing, Aviation appears likely to begin a multi-year recovery in the second half of this year. GE also swapped its aircraft leasing operations to AerCap for a 46% stake in the combined company, intelligently wrapping up its previously troubled GE Capital financing operations and further decreasing overall leverage.

This would enable utilities and industries to accelerate their reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, while facilitating their ability to plan, as well as operate and maintain their networks thanks to standardized services and the use of the same auxiliary equipment. For almost half a century, SF6 gas has been the norm in the electrical power transmission and distribution industry due to its unique physical properties. It is, however a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming if leaked. For this reason, GE and Hitachi ABB Power Grids have been investing in the development of better alternatives to SF6. ""Utilities are becoming increasingly aware of their environmental footprint and the impact it has on their communities and the world around them. Today’s landmark agreement reinforces our commitment to help our customers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions,"" said Heiner Markhoff, CEO of GE’s Grid Solutions.

It was not a disaster like Pratt Whitney. They are emerging in Aviation fully whole and to be feared by rivals.They did incredible progress in wind and totally upset Vesres and Siemens. Both are now playing catch-up.They still have 50% of the world power generators and they are the firm. Allen to build war torn Iraque.They are incredible in body monitor equipment like MRI, sonic tracking g, body function monitors in hospitals, and a whole lot more in medical.All we hear is too much debt. I do not think they have too much debt and they are handling it well and reducingb debt as quick as possible.We keep being jabbed with lack of profits, but everyone with a shred of common sense can clearly see that is coming in the next 24 months.Pensions, dividends, and GE Capital have been hammered to death.All of these are being handled well and reduced systematically.Talk like $5 a share is babble- PURE AND SIMPLE BY ANALYSTS THAT ARE RIDICULOUS.So if you look today at GE compared to a year ago in April, it has come so far.What is now needed is patience.The risk that GE won't go back to a much more profitable worldwide essential manufacturing company is a foregone c I nclusion.Shaking the lingering doubters will take time to heal - but heal it will.",-0.4214

The loan for the North Sea project was provided by BNP PARIBAS Asset Management.The magnetic modules are for GEs Haliade X wind turbines. These are the largest available and will be placed in three wind parks off the North Eastern coast of England on the Dogger Bank.When fully operational, these wind parks will generate 3.6 gigawatts of electricity which is enough to power 4.8 million homes in England. The parks are expected to become operational in the course of 2023.Michiel Slinkert, managing partner at Caple, said: This type of financing requires a bespoke solution and cannot be provided by the main clearing banks.As an alternative financing specialist we were able, together with our corporate finance partner De Beemt Corporate Finance, to tailor an attractive financing structure.Jointly we managed to create significant added value to the funding. We are proud to have been able to contribute to this important sustainable energy project with a large impact.The contract with GE Renewable Energy represents an important increase in production for Bakker Magnetics.The company is a global technical leader in design and assembly of magnets for wind turbines.The magnetic modules are collared between the blades of the turbines and the casing and create a magnetic field which on movement generates electricity. The principle is identical to that of a bicycle dynamo but on a far larger scale.Geert-Jan Bakker, CEO at Bakker Magnetics, said: The main challenge lies in the assembly of the modules.Each module contains 147 magnets in different shapes and forms and North and South polarities. It is a substantial and challenging project for us but it is also an international recognition that we have been involved in the realisation of the largest offshore wind park in the world.The Haliade X is a direct drive wind turbine. With 12 MW capacity it is one of the largest on earth.Haliades blades measure 107 meters and its 600 ton turbine assembly is positioned at a height of approximately 135 meters more than a 30 to 35 storey building. 2021 Global Data Point.",0.9939

The CF6 family grew to include the CF6-50, CF6-80A, CF6-80C2 and CF6-80E1. In the 1980s, the CF6 family of engines emerged as the most popular engines powering wide-body aircraft, including the Boeing 747 and 767, the Airbus A300, A310, A330 and the McDonnell Douglas MD-11.The CF6, in service since 1971, continues to add to its impressive record of flight hours, more than any other commercial aircraft engine ever accumulated. To put that in perspective, it is the equivalent of one engine running 24 hours a day, 365 days a year for more than 26,000 years.The CF6-80C2 engine, which entered service in 1985, has set new standards of reliability in commercial service and has been instrumental in the rise of GE as a leading supplier of large commercial engines.Perhaps the greatest compliment afforded the CF6-80C2 was the U.S. government's selecting the engine to power the U.S. president's 747 aircraft, Air Force One.The CF6 engine family, in service since 1971, continues to add to its impressive record of flight hours, more than any other high-thrust commercial jet engine ever accumulated.

Although it may be a good business move for not only the company, but in the long run the regular investor as well, they should have rode the GREAT news of the AerCap Deal at least until next earnings report. In my opinion, GE share price would have at least rose to 17-18$ by then, no? I’ve been with GE since 2012 and have bought shares at 30$ and as low as 6.50$. I believe in this Company and I am very excited what Culp is doing to simplify GE’s model, lower its debt, and look after their employees and their customers. Future earnings and revenue should greatly sharpen as time transpires. We just need to be patient and it will happen, especially with energy efficiency talks growing rapidly and GE leading the way with wind turbines off shore in the U.K., no? Until public opinion grows extremely bullish (another 3-4 mo or so), the share price will gradually climb until it finally explodes to what it should be worth with their prevailing winds.

1447,"The Real Growth Potential In General Electric is Wind Power Wind Power – The Real Secret is that General Electric leads the field.In 2020 the three wind turbine manufacturers ONLY generated 1/3rd of what the world will absolutely need added every year through 2030. Wind cost is now down to 4 cents per KW and that is very competitive.Or simply said: If General Electric sold $15 billion of RENEWABLES in 2020 – it will have to sell $45 billion of RENEWABLES by 2030 just to supply it’s 1/3rd of the demand (upcoming needs).It is not unreasonable to view the RENEWABLE division of GE as possibly selling $60 billion per year by 2030.Looking clearly at scale - It is more likely that General Electric will grow far faster than Vestas or Siemans. GE is 5 times larger in sales, has contacts in over 130 countries, manufactures and employs in numerous countries, has total access to unlimited working capital and can easily finance unlimited sales. It has incredible research and technology, and GE leads the field in OFFSHORE wind with its monster Haliade 13GW turbine. They are installing hundreds of them right now in New Jersey, Massachusettes, Turkey, England, Netherlands, Maryland and other places. The other two firms are projecting competitive turbines in 24 to 36 months - but so far it is all hype - not real. + + +WHO CAN SUPPLY?There are only 3 players - General Electric, Vestas, and Seimens.In 2020 the three companies installed ONLY 34GW (gigawatts) of wind power worldwide..General Electric – 13.5GW; Vestas 12.4GW; Siemens – 7.65GW Total of the three was 33.24GW But in 10 years the demand for wind will be for 200GW (gigawatts) TOTAL WIND POWER EACH YEAR ....The three firms must definitely add a cumulative total of 125GW NEW WIND POWER generated each year - triple or even quadruple what they are doing now.And profits will definitely follow. If there is a scarcity of manufacturing, the prices charged will move up.The profit spread will increase for all three firms. And it will be far above the 9% Vestas tried to produce in 2020. Think a lot more like 15%.+ + +So I know a lot of people are living for the Q1 2021 results in 2 weeks – but the real picture is Culp is playing a much longer game plan that just a quarter of numbers. His plan has to be to take RENEWABLES to a larger size than Aviation is in normal times. And as I showed you earlier, scarce products makes for higher returns. Don't think just of 9% or 15% net. It can be a lot more.And don’t forget the 20 year maintenance contracts with an additional 20% of built in net profits.That isn’t even figured into this.",0.9981

Fourth-quarter Healthcare results were excellent, with revenues up 6% year-over-year (YoY), operating margins up 3% to 20% and strong FCF conversion. The Power and Renewables segment improved margins due to strength from gas plant services. With flight traffic increasing, Aviation appears likely to begin a multi-year recovery in the second half of this year. GE also swapped its aircraft leasing operations to AerCap for a 46% stake in the combined company, intelligently wrapping up its previously troubled GE Capital financing operations and further decreasing overall leverage.

1752,"Recently Daniel told me CFM made more jet engines than GE. Not true....I thought it would be helpful to give him and others the actual background.In 1970 representatives of Safron (France) visited GE in Boston and had drinks at the Ritz Carlton.They said 'Lets get together and develop a new turbofan engine in the 20,000 pound thrust class to compete in the new developing jet liner industry.""GE had the technology and manufacturing in the deal. The production was set up in Cincinatti.It took 4 years, a lot of France and US government involvement for and against the partnership - but the deal finalized in 1974.By 1985 the fully developed engine had become so powerful that the engine was the best in the industry -powering over time the McDonald Douglas DC-8, Boeing KC135, Boeing 737, and Airbus A320. The very successful partnership lasted for the next 36 years. The deal was set to expire in 2012.In 2008 the partnership was extended until 2040. Pratt and Whitney was the main competitor. Rolls was a distant third. Neither could really compete. Pratt had 23% market share and Rolls 12%. GE had and still has 66% market share. I think it will actually grow more with the new GE 9X engine. The newest GE 9X engine has just been certified worldwide in December. It will be even more efficient (at least 10% less fuel and better design) and is coming on production soon. That is not a CFM product - just GE.The CFM partnership developed the LEAP engine, which originally had no users yet. Over time it became a very successful engine. CFM has delivered 30,700 engines to 570 different operators. For example, in 209 CFM delivered 2127 engines, of which 1736 were LEAP. 123 engines were CFM56's. The LEAP engine is recognized as the most reliable in the industry. The service turn around time between flights is 25 minutes. The engine reliability is 99.98% safe. The LEAP engine is the backbone of both the Boeing and Airbus fleets. The only serious attempt to copy was China, but they gave up and buy from CFM engines now. The demand is so strong that, for example, in February Scandinavian Airways bought 35 Airbus A320's with all the engines being LEAP. That order was for $2.9 billion, and a goodly part of that was for the jet engines. (I have heard it can be 1/3rd of the plane price - not sure).This is part of why I say on the board that GE is an ESSENTIAL SUPPLIER to the airlines. Lacking GE the airlines would have to fall back on Pratt and Pratt has less thrust (under 20,000 ponds today for GE, less reliability, and is losing market share (GE has made serious inroads to Airbus this past year).",0.999

In the mean time GE has the potential to keep moving up if the environment in reference to the covid virus improves, GE will definitely ripe big benefits from that. In my opinion in the event of a reverse split on the near future, the share prize would be around 14 to 16 per share, A RS for GE would work definitely a great choice for the company since that would allow only just over 1 billion total shares to be available to share holders, which in turn would give GE a much better control and when they start paying dividends again would be a much smaller crowd.

2001,"Here is my takeaway from the GE Earnings Call Transcript.I and any serious person doing analysis came away confused with the contradictory comments.I am waiting for the 10K report filed with the SEC to see the actual numbers.But here is my take after reading and re-reading a printed cop of the Transcript.1) The Transcript certainly optimistic going forward.The obvious tone is that the long time frame you look forward - the better the numbers.That is great. I also think the longer term is very positive and I see a lot of 2021, 2022, and 2023 upside.2) The discussion was heavy on ""factoring"". I own a good size corporation and have for decades. We are profitable and have not factored in decades. We self-finance from our past and current profits. That means the firm appears to be hungry for immediate cash. You wouldn't think a company claiming they have access to $45 billion in cash assets would need to factor and pay a middleman - so this is confusing and contradictory information.What is true, however, is the company is presently selling $80 billion a year. They now say they were spending $4 billion to $5 billion a year factoring. That would mean over 2.3% of all the money they take in is spent on interest every month. If you sell $6 billion for a month and pay $260 million ($800 million for the quarter) to factor - It certainly looks to me like they spending 2.3% of their profits were used paying lenders to factor. (probably selling commercial paper short term)Factoring is a new issue. It is so muddy that no serious analysis can be made. They are now claiming eliminating factoring will save $4 billion to $5 billion a year. It was not showing in the past 10k reports so I cannot know what they spent last year on factoring.The good news is this elimination of factoring has to flow to the bottom line.2) On the first few comments they made they restated correctly that they are booking a ""one time lost"" from the GECAS deal of $3 billion. That was announced previously on March 10th. Yesterday on slide 8 they said the amount was a $2.8 billion write-off. This write-off has to show up in the 10K filing for Q1. If that is correct, they just took and immediate write-off. That is a deduct from profits as an offset loss. That $2.8 billion in this Q1 write-off means the real Free Cash Flow for all of 2021 should have been an adjusted $5.5 to $7.5 billion. That would explain their only projecting the $2.5 to $4.5 billion profit for 2021. Not one analyst jumped on this very large offset against profits. But that is HUGE. Steven Tusa did touch it and I suspect this will be his next big thing. But if it is done- it is of no importance after this year.That write-off would really explain all the optimistic comments of reduced factor costs, reduced payroll, reduced overhead, increased margins, and more. It still isn't enough offset being projected because if they are doing all that saving. That means the numbers are too low. I think they are understating things considerably to have better results in a future quarter. It is ""fudging"" their comments - waiting to later announce better results.Lastly, I believe the entire disruption to Aviation and the world over Covid is rapidly evaporating and by the end of this year. Normalcy will be returning. Anything that returns the world to what it was in the start of 2020 will be positive.Final summation is that after the Q1 results were announced - I am sure management is understating the benefits from environment positioning. GE will obviously garner lot of benefits from the planet focusing on reducing environmental pollution. Every single area of General Electric is razor focused and positioned to benefit from adding to reducing climate change.",0.9952

Fourth-quarter Healthcare results were excellent, with revenues up 6% year-over-year (YoY), operating margins up 3% to 20% and strong FCF conversion. The Power and Renewables segment improved margins due to strength from gas plant services. With flight traffic increasing, Aviation appears likely to begin a multi-year recovery in the second half of this year. GE also swapped its aircraft leasing operations to AerCap for a 46% stake in the combined company, intelligently wrapping up its previously troubled GE Capital financing operations and further decreasing overall leverage. We continue to be impressed by the turnaround work of CEO Larry Culp, and the stock remains discounted against the quality of the three core business segments.""",0.9916

I t has too much debt for AERCAP and AERCAP is too small for that sort of deal in the middle of a pandemic and a slow-down aircraft leasing industry. Their sales in 2020 were under-performing and poor..More importantly, someone on this thread said that the GECAS-AERCAP dela would erase $25 billion or 1/4th of the GE Capitalization. Totally wrong.GECAS may be valued at $30 to $40 billion, but it only generates $5 billion per year at GE Capital and it doesn't seem to make money. It is also about 1/2 of the total GE Capital holdings of around $10 billion.And another analyst (CFRA Research) falsely said that by selling GECAS and BIOPHRMA - General Electric was getting rid of the crown jewels. They said the RENEWABLES AND POWER divisions were losers.Wrong. RENEWABLES AND POWER are the new horizon for General Electric. Both have a ton of growth and promise. While they have not made a lot of profit in the past - they can make a lot of profit going forward.GECAS at $5 billion yearly sales and BIOPHARMA t $3 billion yearly sales are just 8% sales of the $100 billion General Electric was recording in 2018. And the large growth of RENEWABLES from $8 billion sales in 2018 to $15 billion sales in 2020 and probably approaching $20 billion sales in 2021 more that offset the GECAS AND BIOPHARMA loss of sales volume.I think GE RENEWABLES will soon be clocking 8% bottom line of $1.6 billion Free Cash Flow in 2021. And remember - GE has not said it was selling GECAS. It is entering into a strengthening deal to change the GE Balance sheet. That is magic in the account industry of how giant industrial companies wring out the best numbers.Look for Larry Culp to squeeze every drop of profit and balance sheet readjustment that is possible going forward while keeping the four crown jewels of the present General Electric.And for serious investors and stockholder - what could be better for the stock than profits going forward, debt erased, and improve balance sheet in the near future ....",0.9982

This stock was split several times over the years (traditional split) without giving any real thought to the bloated share count it was creating. The financial crisis required more dilution and the shares count grew terribly out of control.We know the goal of improving cash flow and the need to raise cash. So buying back shares is not anything that could be considered. Reverse stock split is the only way to bring this back in line.I know many have the reaction (myself included) to paint reverse splits as a negative and desperate move by a company. That is the more traditional use of a reverse split. That is not what this is looking to do. I see this as a strategic move that accomplishes a big big objective without having an impact on the balance sheet.The 8 or 9 to 1 reverse split with take the company from 8.8 billion shares outstanding to .9 to 1.1 billion shares....Without doing the math for you, let me suggest doing this to see the impact... I took a look at Honeywell focusing on these three areas...Shares Outstanding695.5MEPS (TTM, GAAP)6.71P/E Ratio (TTM, GAAP)31.65xSource is TD Ameritrade Summary Page for HoneywellDo the 8 or 9 to 1 reverse split on GE's data to get these numbers....Then extrapolate GE's stock price from there....you will be pleasantly surprised at what you see....Now go look at Honeywells stock price.

2222,"Two points(RS and CEO revised bonus) are really concerned by everybody. I fully understand the concerns. I feel the two points does affect the short term views of GE. This has led recent consolidation from $14.42 to $13.5. However, These two negative points don’t change the long term view. The following is my reasonand understanding of the two concerning points:The first point: the reverse split. I personally view: GE Doesn’t need to do reverse split. Historical data shows only the companies in bad shape did reverse split to boost price to avoid delisting or sugar coding to attract institutional investors. No institutions buy a stock because of high stock prices. They buy because the company is good, not because of high price. All companies having high stock price have never because of reverse split. Not sure which wall street consultant provided the idea. GE should fire the consultant. Sugar coding only means the management didn’t have confidence to take the company to much higher price so that it requires the reverse split. Talking about institutional investors, GE has never short of institutional investors. GE is a stock always having high institutional conviction. It has 63% institutional investors right now. Thus, the reason for attracting institutional investors really doesn’t hold. It clearly the reverse split has created a bad impression in short term which led more than one month of price consolidation. If without the news, GE’s price could reach $16 because of the momentum building up in March. The damage has already done. That being said, After the investors are getting use to it and understand the reverse split only affected short term perceptions, GE is still the same GE; i.e, the outlook and earnings are the key of the future for every company. The second point: is the board revised the bonus of CEO from the option price of $31 to $16. $31 was reasonable price target for the CEO to achieve since GE’s price was at $18 range when he joined the company. Board lowered the price target from $31 to $16 is really too easy to achieve. The $16 is lower than the time when he joined GE. If GE’s price reach $16, he would get $230 million and $31 would get almost $.5 billion to $1 billion. This is not fair to employees and shareholders. After ceo joint GE the stock price dropped from $18 to $6 because of COVID-1, that should not be an excuse to lower his goal to from $31 to $16. He deserves the bonus of $230 million if he can Bring back the stock price to $31 which was $13 higher than the price when joined the company. $31 is a reason target which requires the CEO to work hard to make the company better. GE’s union has raised up the concern also. But it will be hard to unwind the signed contract since the board was behind it.The two points do worry the investors a little bit and raise some red light. Why the board of GE didn’t raise up the concerns?These points upset many shareholders, including me. But these don’t change the positive outlook of the company. The question remains is do you believe the GE positive outlook? I do. With COVID-19 situation is getting better, the GE’s business will get better. This is a large probability. In today’s overvalued market, GE is the fewer undervalued companies in future’s market. This is the reason I like GE.",0.9885

No sure why healthcare have also disappointing results. 3. Cash flow: negative $860 million which better than last year. The outflow was mainly from aviation. 4. Outlook for 2021: profit $.15 to $.25 and cash flow to be positive between $2.5 to $4.5 billion. If aviation will recover better than expected, the earnings and cash flow will be at the high end side. 5. Discontinue to use Facting accounting next quarter.GE is still in very early stage of recovery. What the management did was to make the company leaner and thinner and straightening accounting report. They did it. Can they grow the company? Nobody can answer the question. But one thing is clear and sure: GE is the market leader in each of its business sectors. Their business were affected by COVID-19. It will return to normal in near future. This will be sure thing. As the ceo said: “It is not if, it is when.”Some investors are thinking GE will increase dividend and buy back stock. Don’t expect They will do this until 2023 when GE is fully recovered. Remember they just cut the cost and still have negative cash flow. There are a lot debt to be paid. As the management said, the debt will be cut to $40 billion by the year end of 2021.￼With knowing these facts, it is important to set our expectation and don’t over hype as a shareholder or trader.

Last year OFFSHORE installed 5 GW, mostly General Electric. Going forward the need will triple yearly.With 751 GW of wind power capacity ONSHORE and OFFSHORE already installed, the wind industry has generated nearly 1.2 million jobs globally to date. (International Renewable Energy Agency)As of 2020, there were approximately 550,000 wind energy workers in China, 260,00 in Brazil, 115,000 in the US and 63,000 in India, according to a global survey by GWEC Market Intelligence. The additional 470 GW forecasted wind capacity will create more than 3.3 million direct jobs worldwide.On TV this morning Exxon said there is no way they can move into Wind or Solar.

The reverse split definitely makes perfect sense to almost everyone. Everyone got it . Onto another even more interesting thought....Culp had two goals. The Board granted him a bonus to be paid in stock in 2024 if he stayed and the stock hit certain prices.If the stock hit $25.12 a share - he would get 9,872,611 shares (worth $248 million)If the stock hit $33.34 a share - he would get 13,797240 shares (worth $460 million)Then they dropped the goal down to half, but kept the shares awarded the same. So it mostly is the price he has to reach - not the amount of shares awarded which would remain constant.I am excited because that means Larry Culp will have the get the price up to either $25.12 or $33.34 a share lasting for a month in the next 34 months.He said today - but nobody really heard it - that in 2023 Renewables is on track to have $3 billion free cash flow. As I said in an earlier post, it is mathematically possible for GE to move to that $31 price in the next 2 years. Aviation $6.8 billion FCF, Medical 3 billion FCF, Renewables $3 billion FCF, and Power $3 billion FCF = $16 billion FCF. $16 billion x 23 times = $36.80 stok price.I am even more sure since yesterday that it will happen now!written by:Gene (not the ""G"", ""GE to 0"" or ""Gregg"" who is also posting under the same sign)",0.9957

If they were broken up, the government would step in and monitor or control any asset sale.Just their military activity is about $15 billion for the Department of Defense.

It is important for GE to stay above 50 days moving average in near term. GE needs to stay above $13.18 next few days and move back to $13.5 areas to maintain bullish pattern.That being said, GE’s long term bullish pattern still looks great and fundamental also supports the long term bullish pattern.Thus, we, as long term investors, can try to accumulate more shares when the short term bears pushed the price lower.I just opened several limited orders @$13, $12.75 and $12.5 to buy.

2417,"Lots of bullpucky going on with the ""EXPERTS""Motley Fools Lee Samaha took a spin on GE using a terrible comparisonWho cares about comparing market cap plus debt (EV formulas) to get a comparison figure looking at competitors in the four areas GE is excelling on. All of the competitors do NOT CLOSELY have comparable size or scale.... Kind of like turning a power boat around compared to turning the Queen Mary. Completely different things! And counting the tires on the car and adding them us is about as foolish as adding capitalization to debt to get a EV figure. Who cares????The facts are:GE is a work in progress. Added to that change in the General Electric fundamental direction we have just passed through the eye of the needle as 12 months on corona lock down should pulverize most businesses.It did not pulverize General Electric. How much strength they show....But here is the real comparison....Use free Cash Flow. Everyone seems to thing dollars in pockets matters and planning, investment, research, and future are drags on the basic company. Do not believe that FCF is the real test - but lets look at FCF....Aviation will return to the 2019 FCFof $6.8 billion and not too long from now.Healthcare will maintain their 2020 FCF of $3 billion.Renewables is the question mark. If you take a potential 5% profit on $15 billion sales you get $750 million.That number could be larger if they reach 8% profit like Vestas has on perhaps a $20 billion sales this year which is possible with GE sales pouring in. That number of 8% x $20 billion would then be FCF $1.6 billion. Renewables are the real wildcard.Power is the next wild card. GE has a lot of customers all over the world not abandoning their existing power grid. GE in 2017 had FCF of 1.95 billion. A loss in 2018 and a modest FCF $386 million in 2019 were not good things. Last year after selling off coal, power division was only able to squeeze out FCF of $274 million. Lets see if Culp with his newer energy efficient products can push GE Power to new heights.So the second huge question mark on where power will land in 2021. Because I have total faith - I place my money on a really solid GE turnaround. GE has larger sales in all segments. GE has deeper pockets. GE has more talent. GE is better situated worldwide to reach key buyers in all segments. GE is in a rebuilding phase coming out of the pandemic.What that all translates to is a 2021 FCF that may reach $1 a share or a $20 a share stock price. That is calculated at 20 times earning. For the more speculative crowd, that number could reasonably reach 25 times earnings or $25 a share.Watch out!!2022 will be a bombshell. It isn't too far off for serious investors. GE could easily return to FCF over $13 billion and $1.50 a share. That would make the $30 price very believeable. And the stock price can possibly much higher. I wonder how 2023 will look? beyond awesome?GE is headed right and all the experts with all their figures cannot tell you more.Using oddball formulas like EV (market cap plus debt) is a real distraction from real actual and potential numbers. Either you believe in GE and the chances made to get them to reach new levels - or you are speculating the best is now and the future is much slower.I prefer the glass half full - not half empty.",0.9989

Culp plans to sell part or all of the 111 million AerCap shares.Couldn't wait for the small 100 share investor to evaporate. That is causing a 5%-10% swingin the daily stock moves - up and down. Just look at today with 135 million shares sold in 90 minutes and a 94 point downward market swing. Pure FEAR.For real investors all the above could not matter less.Fundamental GE business is firmly rooted on the 4 divisions (Aviation, Renewables, Health, Power).All of these divisions have great market position. Each division exceeds $20 billion in sales (Aviation closer to $35 billion). Each could really contribute to FCF going forward if you do not measure in 202 quarters and instead measure in a couple of years. Most of these divisions if they were standing alone would dwarf most other companies on the stock exchange in pure sales volume.... Profits will follow. Obviously measured in days as a person owning GE is a ridiculously poor bet. Long term - awesome!Once again you are seeing analysts shout obvious sightly thought out opinions. They continue to show poor judgement. Some say better place to invest exists (bitcoin, Tesla, AMC, Gamestock for example). Wouldn't trade one GE share for any of these outright gambles. Some say GE is in trouble. Ridiculous! At $70 billion gross 2021 sales and $45 billion in the bank for use any way they seek to use it - GE is in exceptional condition to take a severe upward trek!Some analysts say too G has too much debt but ignore the $70 billion paid back against the earlier total. Culp is delivering and the company has managed lots of serious debt replacement in the past 24 months.Some say the firm (GE) is selling off the parts and there will be nothing left. Any serious fool can see that there will be 4 firmly exceptional divisions going forward. All will be future profitable divisions of GE. Any and all will dominate in their markets - including Power which owns 50% of the world market and has new low pollution generators to replace older models.....And some analysts cannot understand that taking the stock up 8 clicks(8-1 Reverse split) comes closer to $104 a share - joining other important stocks. A stock rolling in the mud at $6 to $13 is not very exciting for serious investors. And has anyone thought about FCF of $10 billion (totally possible in just Aviation and Health not counting Renewable and Power results) )with only 1 billion in outstanding stock makes earnings much more exciting going forward. At 20 times earnings- the stock would be trading at $200. At 25 times earnings the stock would be trading at $250. Doesn't that excite anyone or are we in a sea of fools?So let the stock tank today and recover tomorrow. At 135 million shares traded in 90 minutes - there is genuine panic in the market.

2498,"Two excellent questions are posted today on the GE Board.The first is about the reverse stock split.Generally, when the number of outstanding shares changes - it signals a way to pay down debt.Think of the United States Treasury. They are broke but they keep issuing bonds to pay debt. At that pace they will never catch up.Looking back to 2010 General Electric in 2010 had 11 issued million issued shares. In 2016 General Electric had just 10 million outstanding shares.In 2018 as Culp came in. Flaherty had been buying back stock and he spent a fortune (probably spent $20 billion to buy back 1.4 billion shares) reducing outstanding shares to 8.6 million outstanding shares.In order to pay some kind of dividend, in 2018 General Electric gave a weird stock split. For every 100 shares you could now have 104 shares - a sort of dividend.The stock price during these last eleven years is even more up and down. Dec 2010 - $13.40; Dec 2012 - $16.50; Dec 2014 - $21.53; Dec 2016 - $28.24; Dec 2018 - $6.82; Dec 2019 - $10.96; and Dec 2020 - $11.08.And along came the virus/pandemic and it was a real game changer for General Electric. Gone was the $6.6 billion profit cash cow in their Aviation that kept the price around supported at around $12. The rest of the company was bleeding to death, except medical. By 2018 GE Management knew they were in deep trouble. The 2010 stock was at $13.40 and had sunk to $6.82. It was precariously low. That was the time EVERY GENERAL ELECTRIC STOCKHOLDER should not have slept nights.The 2018 really low earnings (loss, not profit) could NEVER keep supporting a generous dividend, a pension fund, over $130 billion interest paying off debt, 330,000 employees on the payroll, and way too many outstanding shares at 8.8 billion.Talk of breaking up the company was a real possibility.To do a turnaround of such a giant company - the first and most important thing is to change the Board of Directors. They did that and the new Board fired Flanerty and brought in Larry Culp. That was a full size gamble. Other than Culp's 15 years excellent performance at Danafar - he was jumping into a 5 times bigger world wide very scattered and diversified company in a total mess. Few would accept such a challenge. Culp did NOT do this for the money. He saw something others could not see.... A path to righting the ship.It took Culps first 18 months to just stop the company from crashing up and down. We now know in hindsight the decisions he made were excellent Forget the Steve Tusa and John Inch and the Chuck Watkins or any other analyst. All they want to do is look bacwards and criticize. They simply have it all wrong. The past nine months Culp has started a very solid recovery plan. I doubt we will ever see anything as bad as the past 10 years. I expect to see the going forward to be so much progress that it will be written up in years future as a study on what not to do and what to do.Now for the 8:1 Reverse Stock Split.Culp and the Board agree the best thing to stabilize the stock is to reduce the outstanding stock shares. It has zero to do with a failing company.They know this huge stock overhang is dangerous. Any good manager knows that taking an 8 times stock reduction will better match the upcoming price. It allows the company to look wealthier at $100 a share instead of $13 a share. It gets rid of a lot of small investors and even halts the many short sellers. GE is #16 in size as an industrial company. You wouldn't know it by the stock price. GE going forward will join the ranks of many other giant industrial firms like Honeywell, 3 M, Raytheon, Catapillar, and Boeing. As long as they are not diluting the existing stockholder base - it is a very clean and clever plan.A lot of the today GE investors keep saying the 8:1 Reverse Split show weakness and announces GE is a loser. Nothing could be further from the truth. You don't see the 1,740 funds holding 60% of the stock selling off. They know that the reverse split will be better going forward. The higher the stock price is - the more prestige there is. Think of Berkshire Hathaway where most people could only buy a share or possibly two.On to the second point that the $230 million bonus is unfair. Fact: Culp will not collect it until he leaves the company and then after 2025 and then only will it be in treasury stock which will not affect any stockholder. The reduction from $32 to $16.64 is fine with me. I have no concern on rewarding him since $220 million compared to the many $billions coming up is going to look like ""chump change"" in the rear-view mirror.The many hecklers on the Board are simply treating this as a PlayStation fun arcade game and they goad and they cajole and they tell dumb jokes and they ridicule. They mean nothing. They certainly contribute even less. But it is a free country. Anyone can be up there polluting this serious informative Board ....",0.9997

Technical program traders saw the pattern breaking down 10-moving average also joined to short the stock.If you listen to the conference call, all are positive news. I am gain more confidence after I saw the GE’s price movement quickly moved from $12 to $14.5 last week. It made me believe GE is alive again. GE could reach $16 due to the trend momentum if the company didn’t announce the reverse split. This has temporarily caused the up trend to trade sideways in short term.

2713,"Wind Power – The Real Secret is that General Electric leads the fieldIn 2020 wind turbine manufacturers generated 1/3rd of what the world will absolutely need in 2030.That means that all three firms need to triple their manufacturing production during the next 10 years.We need to add 1,250GW over the 10 years or 125GW added every year.Therefore worldwide wind manufacturers need to go from 60GW in 2020 to $125GW new wind power in 10 years (2030).That means we need to triple the wind power generated.+ + +Or simply said, if General Electric sold $15 billion of RENEWABLES in 2020 – it will have to sell $45 billion of RENEWABLES by 2020 just to supply it’s 1/3rd of the upcoming needs.In 2020 the three companies installed 34GW of wind power worldwide (gigawatts).General Electric – 13.5GW; Vestas 12.4GW; Siemens – 7.65GW Total 33.24GW Simply on scale - It is more likely that General Electric will grow far faster than Ventas or Siemans.So the RENEWABLE part of GE could top $60 billion per year or $600 billion in the 10 years upcoming.And if there is a scarcity of manufacturing, the prices charge will move up and the profit spread will increase.Who can supply??The hard reality is that outside China, there are only 3 wind turbine manufactures. (excludes Goldsmith Envision, Ming Yang, Shanghai Electric, all only in and supplying China) + + +Here are some boring but essential figures to look at:To support these present and future wind needs taken from leading Renewable sources – they stateTotal existing ONSHORE wind is 650GW.Total ONSHORE wind in 2030 needs to be 1,787GW.That is an ONSHORE wind increase of 117GW a year or 1,170GW needed in the next 10 years + + +Total OFFSHORE wind in 2020 is 35GWTotal OFFSHORE wind in 2030 needs to be 213GWThat is an OFFSORE wind increase of 117GW a year or 1,170GW needed in the next 10 years + + +The combined OFFSHORE and ONSHORE wind increase by 2030 is200GW a year or 2,000GW more wind needed.So I know a lot of people are living for the Q1 2021 results in 2 weeks – but the real picture is that Culp is playing a much longer game plan that just a quarter of numbers. His plan has to be to take RENEWABLES to a larger size than Aviation is in normal times.

Private retailers also will benefit once it’s done ! The communication around the RS should definitely improve ! So the underlying facts and motivation for the RS are understandable...GLTA",0.9886

2750,"I am asked how GE stock could get $30 or $40 a shareIt is simply tied to profit x 23 times - give or take.I think Aviation will return quickly to the $6.5 billion FCF. 17% is already assured with military existing sales and not a worry for GE in volume and profits.I know Medical is hovering at $2.6 billion FCF and should rise to $3 billion in the near future.The secret sauce is Renewables. Barrons just projected in 2024 a $3 billion FCF General Electric Renewables - but I think there is a lot of wiggle room on this area.The one area GE is new in and has an unlimited ability to expand and is also totally dominant is wind power. That market is exploding and there are only 3 real companies to supply. Vestas and Siemens are smaller and restricted by resources - money, manufacturing plants, people, and marketing contacts.GE is the really only firm worldwide ready to take on the wind turbine offshore scale coming up in the next 24 months and profits will obviously follow. Not just the 8% net profit talked about by Vestas last winter in their results - but with the 20 year service contracts that GE is collecting, net profits should climb to at least a 15% profit. Remember GE has lead in wind turbines the USA for the past 2 years, installing more ONSHORE wind farms than anyone. Siemens is simply not selling anything in the USA. All those General Electric wind turbine sales have contracts for 20 year service attached. In aircraft that add-on represents is a 20% profit, but to be reasonable I have used a 15% markup.In many ways wind is a lot like aviation. Sell the razors cheap and then profit mightily on the refill blades.Also the selling to a very established wind farm operator builds future sales bridges going forward. More wind farm sales, more relationships in the future.Lastly we have not added the $1 billion FCF for Power that is coming. That is more uncertain but has a lot of possibilities. We did not mention digital or GE Capital - each supposed to move to profits in 2021.So if you add Aviation $6.5 billion, and Medical $3 billion, and Renewables $3 billion and Power $1 billion you get a total of $13.5 billion profit in the near future once things normalize.A conservative 23 times $13.5 billion makes a stock price of $31.50 a share.But that ratio may be low, or the profits may be low, or time will just allow that number to grow.So I am not hallucogenic when I say that General Electric stock price more likely than not will reach a price of $30 or $40 as share in the next couple of years. I certainly am not a cheerleader. I am a REALIST.The upside is terrific and the downside is nil.",0.9992

So buy now at $13.50. Gets to $16 (which seems extremely unlikely). RS, plunges 15% (likely much more over weeks?). We're back at equivalent to 13.50 (but actually $108).

Plenty of people lost their shirts and more on this company and now they want to take away their monetary leverage of regaining some of their losses. Yes GE has jettisoned some of its losing divisions, but it is still a risky company, but we were their Cheer Leaders. But at $100 a share GE will lose a lot of its following. The enthusiasm for holding the stock will mostly be gone. Mutual Funds and Hedges will have to support it. But GE won't stay at $100 -$114 a share. Its not just a Mathematical Equation.

Sure, initially your post-split financial position is the same but if you are at a current loss which many current stockholders are, it takes huge upticks in stock price to recover those losses (ie. $8 to recover $1). A case in point is C which reversed split about 15 years ago at about $4.50 (10 for 1). Today C is at $72 or $7.20 pre-split price. So not even a double after 15 years. Maybe GE could participate in a GME-like rally but consider that a GE pre-split cost-basis of $30 to today's market price of $13ish means GE must go up $136 from $104 post-split in order to break-even.

The 400k homes and businesses are they all converting from natural gas to electric to heat their homes in the Massachusetts winters? You’re telling me all the ultra rich in Nantucket are going to convert their homes from gas heat to electric heat? Really. If not what’s the use of windmills?

He is a practitioner ""lean and mean"".Over the years Culp has engineered at least 20 acquisitions successfully. All have turned out profitably....He has also sold a number of divisions - each time profitably.He developed special systems for motivating and getting the most from his employees.That system was patterned after the Japanese work style.It was so successful in steamlining the company, that EVERY acquisition turned profitable and successful.After he left Danaher in 2015, he went on to teach at Harvard.He ws one of the most sought after speakers and sought after classes on campus.In 2018 he joined the GE Board. He was recruited to take GE to an entirely new plateau.GE is 5 times larger than Danaher but it is the same puzzle - just bigger and far more complex.There is no doubt where GE is headed. It is on a trajectory to soar.For any serious INVESTOR wanting to make ten to fifteen times their investment over the next years - it is a brain dead decision to buy GE. What is happening is obvious. GE is simply following the very successful Culp playbook.",0.983

It would also discourage day traders participation by loosing more of emotional retail investors and related stock volatility. The Retail fleeing will make room for lower stock price and ""noise free"" entree of additional institutional interest - this remains to be seen over time.I do not think Larry Culp would consider reverse split unless better days are coming up and unless he was advised to do so by institutional investors and analysts.I like the overall GE turnaround based on adaptability and futuristic plans.

2918,"GE has been trading sidelines for almost 2 months between $12 and $14. It’s daily trading range is tightening, however, and could be getting ready for another big move.Recently, most of GE Analysts have raised Their Earnings, Cash Flow Forecasts, but the price of GE stays at $13 to $13.5.The GE Chart: Over the course of the last two months, General Electric’s daily trading range has become smaller recently. The bears tried to push it under $13 several times, but failed. GE has been trading in a sideways channel above a support level at $12.90 and below a resistance level at $13.79Currently, GE's stock is still being held down by both the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA) and the 21-day EMA. The eight-day EMA is also trending slightly below the 21-day EMA which is bearish. This is the reason why the bears tried to push GE lower. They hope GE lose support if they can bring it down under $12.8. They didn’t remember GE is trading well above the 200-day simple moving average, however, which indicates overall sentiment in the stock is bullish. Longs realize the long term bright side so they use temporary￼ bearish pattern created by the bears as an opportunity to accumulate GE stock. Thus, the bears failed to take down GE price since great underline buying are waiting to buy for the desired limited price. Unfortunately, GE was in the trading range $12.8 to $13.6.￼ ￼Bulls want to see GE's stock regain the eight-day and 21-day EMAs as support. If GE can pop over its EMAs, it has room to move back up to the $13.80 level. If it could regain that level as support it could move toward the $15 mark which is resistance from back in 2018.Bears want to see the eight-day and 21-day EMAs continue to push GE's stock down until it loses support at $12.90. If the stock falls below that they hope GE will fall to $12.23. The chance for that happen is slim unless indexes crashed. Thus, I placed limited order to buy at $12.98, $12.83 and $12.75. Could GE breakout the trading range between $12.9 and $13.6 next week? I personally think it is over due for the breakout. If not next week, maybe the week after!",0.9976

The company wants to bring that $70 billion figure down by about 35% to $45 billion by 2023, largely by cutting its roughly $43 billion in borrowings nearly in half.If the company is successful, that should bring its net debt down to about 2.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), compared to net debt of about 6 times EBITDA today.Happe said the company has ""multiple paths"" to reach its goal, including proceeds from its many divestitures and expected growth in free cash flow. GE will also own about 46% of AerCap after the deal closes, subject to a lockup of up to 15 months. Happe said that the company is likely to monetize that stake ""when the cycle recovers"" for airlines post-pandemic.General Electric is in the middle of a multiyear turnaround. The company is currently worth about one-sixth of its $600 billion market cap at the turn of the century, weighed down by its massive debt load and some market-topping acquisitions.The new GE will be smaller and more focused on aviation, healthcare, power, and renewables, with most of its financing and debt tied to those industrial businesses.Happe said that she expects current-quarter cash flow for GE to be ""meaningfully improved"" from the first quarter of 2020, a key metric analysts have been following in tracking the turnaround.",0.8894

Culp becoming CEO of GE after the fantastic performance at Danaher, you missed a funny and real part of that story :when he took over DHR at 39 he took over a so called mini-GE at the time as DHR was a small conglomerate with a Market cap of 20B while GE Market cap was 400B ... and by 2018 DHR was close to 200B and GE down to under 100B and decided GE and Culp was the most promising of all i ever new and luckily as real estate was a sellers market i sold two homes and averages down buying GE 2022 options striking as 7, 10, 12 and 15 starting when GE was at 11 on the way down to 6, but i never wavered as my family recommended i see a head doctorall and all Culp so far did a lot more than i ever dreamed at GE just to mention a few :- cut dividend- sold bio-pharma for a price over WS valuation- cut employees numbers by half by getting rid of BKR- refinanced all debt due '21 - '25 to '23 and over- waved salary 2020 and asked all management to take a 50% cut (great management example)- etc, etcthe only thing to worry me is agreeing with your concern about fuzzy Q1 2021 report especially selling receivables and cutting earnings by about 2%, are they desperate for cash ? if you get any more details about this issue please post it, i am learning a lot from you (i did only one thing all my life, designed nuclear power plants, so i am intensively learning about stocks and follow you closely)much appreciate any comments about above",0.9962

3183,"More false news by analysts that cant read the GE financials....It gets tiring to look at FAKE NEWS. All that untrue reporting gets old.It is wearying to see a financial person stripping all the footnotes from a financial report and claiming it changes the results by $7.6 billion less profit for General Electric.. That accounting method reminds me of my wife. She can remember the current debt we have but she never counts the stock I own. She never counts our paid up house value. She discounts all the property I own. She never counts any of my assets. Using that formula she has me always broke. That is a ridiculous way to count.... The 3 credit bureaus use the exact same logic. They tell me when I charge a card- not what I have behind that charge as assets. To them I am always overspent - but it is untrue.In corporate America I have seen the footnote used dozens of times. It is a necessary thing to explain why something was done and why it was legal and fair.Today the GE headline news was written by a Forbes using a thing called Robo-Analyst by Hunter Anderson.He claims he read all 110 pages of the GE 10k filing for end of 2020 and he says the footnotes are hiding real losses of 7.8 billion.I also have read and studied all the 110 pages of the 2020 GE 10-k. I completely disagree with the Anderson conclusion....A footnote in their most recent 10k only EXPLAINS any CHARGE .... The final numbers are what is reported to all OF US and they are what you would rely on....Their auditors would never allow ""sham"" charges because that would be illegal and be fraud....In corporate financials I want to see what they spent on so I can see if it will reoccur again. MOST OF THE FOOTNOTES ARE ONE TIME EXPENSES. They re there to tell me times will be better going ahead. I gladly read them and wish they were even more detailed - but they never are. What I do know is the real profits. The future going forward is found in the actual income statement numbers under income, expenses, and profit (most people love to call it free cash flow). The footnotes depress the FCF and the actual profit to REDUCE INCOME TXES among other reasons. So the take away is you just have to watch carefully what you read. I am only interested in the results that will continue over the next 3 years and could care less on the write offs last year. 2020 was a dog year for GE and a lot of others....In most of Anderson's statements he claims GE deducted costs which depresses earnings. Businesses does that to reduce taxes. It is smart and legal. Deducting more costs does not raise earnings. It simply explains why GE would have had more profit.Reading footnotes lets me decide if that expense will actually reduce earnings and increase your costs. It is totally judgement call. What I like about it is that it tells me the worse scenario and I can decide for myself what an ""impairment charge"" or ""restructure charge"" will be. In all cases it is a deduction - not an overstated profit of income.Things like closing plants, paying severance pays to ex employees, research, paying into the pension fund, paying off some of the GE Capital debt, changing the upcoming tax charges to meet the new expected results, paying off the SEC Wells settlement - all legitimate EXPENSES THAT REDUCE PROFITS -not add to them.As I said months ago, if I was Larry Culp I would put as much old garbage on the financial statements I could to get rid of the past and get ready for the future. It is old garbage. All of 2020 was a write off year to gt ready for an awesome upcoming 24 months. Here is just one glaring excellent example of a write off was in 2020. GE wrote off the $500 million GE spent on developing the offshore wind turbine they installed in Rotherdam. That 13gw wind turbine required lots of research. GE reported all the development costs for offshore wind turbines in 2020 against the 2020 Renewables income. They reported a division loss that year. If they had not spent the research money - they would have come close to even.I prefer the expense because it catapulted GE Wind into the lead. Nobody has touched them and I doubt they ever will. The real clincher is the demand for wind is so great and growing so fast that all three companies are in huge demand. So look carefully at what is real and close your eyes on what is untrue. I have zero trust in any analyst reporting on facts. They really just have ""hunches"" and nothing behind their hunches....",0.9993

3269,"Freight Of The World: Global Cargo Airline Picks GE Engines To Power New Boeing 747 Jetsby The GE Aviation BlogThe global freight carrier Atlas Air Worldwide said on Tuesday a quartet of new Boeing 747-8 freighters it ordered from Boeing in January will be powered by GE jet engines. The deal, which includes engines and overhaul services, is valued at $800 million at list price over the life of the 20-year maintenance contract.“The 747-8F powered with GEnx engines gives us the best and most versatile widebody freighter in the market,” said John W. Dietrich, Atlas Air Worldwide president and chief executive officer. “Our partnership with GE Aviation supports our longstanding focus on leading edge technology. We look forward to continuing to provide world-class service to our customers.”Atlas is the world’s largest operator of Boeing 747 freighter aircraft, with 53 of them in its fleet. The Boeing 747-8 is the latest and the most advanced version of the Boeing 747, also known as the Jumbo Jet, which helped redefine air travel over the last half-century.Above: A GEnx-2B engine at GE Aviation's test center in Peebles, Ohio. Image credit: GE Aviation. Top image: An Atlas Air Boeing 747-8. A new deal between GE and Atlas Air includes engines and overhaul services, is valued at $800 million at list price over the life of the 20-year maintenance contract. Image credit: Atlas Air.Each of the new planes carries four GEnx-2B jet engines, a close relative of the efficient engines that power another advanced Boeing jet, the 787 Dreamliner. Atlas said its new planes will have 20% higher payload capacity and 16% lower fuel consumption than the previous version, the 747-400.Airlines and other GE customers have ordered more than 2,500 GEnx engines since they entered service early in the last decade, making it the fastest-selling, high-thrust engine in GE’s history.The engine owes its popularity, in part, to advanced technologies and materials that helped it achieve the highest reliability and utilization, lowest fuel burn and longest range capable of any engine in its thrust class, according to GE. For example, the GEnx is the world’s first commercial engine with both a carbon fiber composite front fan case and fan blades. The material — which GE first used for fan blades on the GE90 engine — helps make the fan module lighter and corrosion-resistant, simplify maintenance, and improve reliability. GE Aviation has also developed a 3D-printed component for the engine that helps to further reduce its weight. The GEnx is also the quietest engine GE produces.“The GEnx-2B engines have proven their reliability and durability since entering service almost a decade ago, and GE Aviation is committed to providing full support for these engines long into the future,” said Jason Tonich, vice president and general manager of global sales and marketing at GE Aviation.",0.9988

Revenue slid 12% to $17.12 billion, while the Street was looking for $17.48 billion.""We are improving our cash performance and profitability with Industrial free cash flow growth of $1.7 billion year-over-year, excluding biopharma, and organic margin expansion across all segments, except aviation,"" said Chief Executive H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. ""This continued progress sets us up well to deliver on our 2021 commitments.""Aviation segment revenue dropped 28% from a year ago to $4.99 billion, as orders fell amid ""ongoing pandemic-related challenges,"" the company said. Revenue in healthcare fell 9% to $4.31 billion, although the company said the segment rose 7% organically with some medical procedures returning to pre-pandemic levels.GE's power segment saw revenue slide 3% to $3.92 billion while orders were down 12% amid declines in the gas power and power portfolios businesses, although gas turbine orders were up by nine year-on-year to 18. Revenue in renewable energy rose 2% to $3.25 billion as onshore and offshore wind orders increased.Culp said the deal to combine its GE Capital Aviation Services plane-leasing business to AerCap, announced in the March quarter, will give it cash and a ""meaningful equity stake for further upside and flexibility as the aviation industry recovers."" When the deal was announced last month, GE said it would get about $24 billion in cash and shares that represent about 46% ownership in the joint company.""We are shifting more toward offense and capturing opportunities in the energy transition, precision health, and future of flight,"" Culp said Tuesday. ""I am confident we are well positioned to drive profitable growth, achieving high single digit free cash flow margins over time and creating long-term value for shareholders.""GE reiterated guidance for adjusted EPS of $0.15 to $0.25 for 2021 and industrial revenue growth in the low single-digit range on an organic basis.

The amazing thing about the transaction is it pretty much leaves GECAS and GEs ability to generate cash flow from it the same. GE is getting 46% of a company, AER, that earns right now roughly $1 Billion per year. I tried to do some research on GECAS and the last thing I found was from 2018 when they said they earned roughly 1 billion. Assume that 1 billion carries to the new entity which would get AERs profit to 2 billion so GE will still be earning roughly 1 billion from it's 46% stake in AER and will have reduced its debt by $24 billion. This appears to be a rather ingenious transaction for GE.Also, Tusa is a liar. He said this adds 21 billion of debt to industrial GE. As the GE board member said yesterday GE Capital has 10 billion in cash which also comes over so the net debt is already down to 11 billion and then they will also own half of a company with a 15 billion market cap.

Even if GE just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem.

If sustained, GE will be able to afford a dividend rise.Is that what's going on here? Because if it isn't, the argument that shares of GE are becoming overvalued and its nearing time to sell becomes stronger if its shares are really trading within the vertical range they have since 2018. No dividend increase, is a sell signal.

3668,"What GE really needs to do to accelerate its growth rate and strengthen its technology leadership in the entire tech sector is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for GE (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if GE just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

3889,I’m reading a LOT of hoping on this board. A lot of I’m hoping GE will beat tomorrow. I hope this goes to $20. Ect.... The thing is there’s a big difference between hoping for something and the reality. GE will go higher but it won’t be tomorrow. What’s going to drive this stock up is AVIATION!! Not healthcare and certainly not the hopey changey thing about Windmills and the “green” deal. That’s pure pipe dream. Unless aviation moves higher and more IMPORTANTLY that the outlook for aviation improves this year this stock is dead in the water. I just don’t see aviation making a comeback in 2021. Look at Alcoa they mine aluminum and they see that being down this year. That’s an important driver as airplane structures are mainly aluminum. Don’t believe me yet? Look at Arconic. They specialize in making airline parts and they are getting hammered too after a big run up last year. As I’ve said before almost every company that has reported so far has gotten hammered. GE will be no different. Will GE survive? Yes! But that doesn’t mean that this stock is moving north anytime soon. If you didn’t have the China Virus last year I would bet this would be trading in the 17 - 22 range. But here we are. HOPING to get above $11 again.,0.9959

That is not the case now.But there are still short trades with computer programs making lightening in and out minute by minute decisions.These are different because the bet is huge, the risk is low, and they are fairly safe bets on small changes. These will not really affect the GE stock moves if you look at it long term.2) The GE stock has heated up over the past 3 weeks moving from a low around $10.50 to $13. This move is really not supported by earnings or earnings rumor. It is based on the long term belief in Larry Culp, the effect the vaccine is making on the pandemic, the belief that within 6 months things will return to a better place, and the obvious new energy GE has shown on Renewables,improved carbon emmiting generator products in power, their new super sensitive scanning MRI and monitoring equipment (supposedly a game changer)the new 9X turbo jet engine that has passed government certification and approval All these and more giving GE dominance in the very environmental sensitive energy market.and you can add a 3rd thing3) GE has taken all the fat out of their game.Reduced employment from over 330,00 to 160,000 closed numerous redundant manufacturing plantsreduced the pension obligation to under 20% and around only $20 billion unfunded - possibly lowerreduced the GE Capital portfolio from a bloated $5 billion a while ago to around $10 billionimproved the GE Capital portfolio financing only top quality things they mostly make and sellgetting the long term life insurance annuity portfolio under control and reducing exposurereducing the overall corporate debt to a very manageable $20 billion or near thatLeaving the $8 billion in Baker Tool 33% ownership as an unused equitybeing savvy enough to keep the dividend a one centbeing also intelligent not to go out on a buying spree or spending their cash on stock buybackSo a long term investment in GE is a bet on old fashioned common sense.General Electric has made all the right moves to move back to a very high price based on a much better Free Cash Flow.It is mostly a matter of time - not if but whenAs an investor, I have the patience to wait for the results.",0.9917

How many orders does Boeing have? I?ll wait for that answer. But the new administration! The Green New Deal! Yes yes yes that?s the ticket you say! All the off shore windmills oh yes that?s going to drive GE to new heights! Let?s just see how fast ANY of that gets done. If there?s one thing Democrats and Republicans can agree on is that the Federal government is as quick to change as the Private sector.....NOT! Now don?t get me wrong, GE isn?t going to file for BK protection nor is it going to $4 like #$%$ says. But we?re sitting pretty high in the market right now and the policy changes being implemented are going to have a ripple effect theough the economy.

This stock is set to hit $20 this year, because it is built on fundamentals and a ever-improving balance sheet. finally, dont believe any of the clowns that say Culp's bonus share-price target wont also be altered by a reverse split. If he receives a bonus at achieving $25/share and we do the 1-to-8 split, then his new bonus target is $200/share. Do not listen to these clowns on this board.

Don't forget the little mom & pop, us little retail investors who are adding MILLIONS of shares to our humble investments.. Toosa is putting JPM or their clients on the hook to deliver $$30+ BILLION worth of shares, perhaps that is why Toosa aka Markapolos desperately threw the whole kitchen sink at GE multiple times. All said and done, when dust settles, someone, collective group are on the hook to deliver those HUGE number of shares. I believe Toosa's unprecedented foolish ego put our dear JPM's & Clients' huge amount of resources on the hook, in danger, and it's many times BIGGER disaster than the ""JPM London Whale $6 BILLION LOSS"", GOOGLE about it.. I LOVE JPM as I LOVE GE, both are American, contributing in very important matters. But GE stands tall over JPM as the PRICELESS CROWN-JEWEL of America, none can fill GE shoes, hardly competition ever existed. JPM, AAPL, GOOG, AMZN etc can NOOT claim this, because they have 1000s of copy cats, GE near monopoly.. I humbly suggested our dear JPM to replace Toosa before he and his buddies cause further damage to HUGE RESOURCES of JPM & Clients, and their reputation..#2 PRICELESS GE CROWN-JEWEL of America. For USA/World, it is absolutely imperative, absolutely must to have GE PRODUCTS & SERVICES, FED-$DOLLAR to function and grow World Commerce/Economy GDP. Not even AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, lol NFLX, JPM, WMT, none can claim that enviable position except GE, and US Gov-FED $$DOLLAR.. Even AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, JPM, WMT, OIL & Gas have MILLIONS of copy cats, lessor quality, but others can do the job AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, JPM, WMT doing.. Just think, study GE products and you will quickly know what I am referring to. Aviation-Engines, GE Healthcare chips, softwares, critical emergency-room machines, from big MRI, X-Ray, CT-Scanners to tinny hand held devises that count your heart-beats, pulses, while you or your dearest ones clinging to last ray of hope to be alive and saved.

Sorry for long note but hopefully this will help those who are on the fence. I worked at GE back in the 90s as a young lad and learned so much about management from the great Jack. Great company to work for back then. My division got sold off for pennies because we were not #1 or #2 in the industry and holy cow he threw us out like trash but he meant what he said, no BS. Tons of integrity and self empowerment. Some of the smartest people I ever worked with at GE. Enough of background so u know I am not pulling this out of my butt. GE under crushing debt and if rates rise it will be hammer time. Larry is a great turnaround CEO only if he can monetize the existing business. No doubt he will make the company leaner and more efficient but that won't be enough. He has to raise revenue. Ok, can he raise revenue in jet engines, healthcare and power. 3 core business. Jet Engines: business travel, core part of airlines is not coming back ever as virtual tech improves, unless u believe ecommerce will slow down and more malls will pop up.Healthcare: Very possible but only if they innovate. They stop innovating long time ago... e.g., MRI is dying tech. I can't believe we still use that old tech... We put a man on the moon and that's the best we can do? when was the last time u got an MRI and doctor said, wow that was helpful. every time I get it, the doctor doesn't even look at it. u get the point... lots of old tech at GE. Power: This could be a possibility. As demand for electricity increases via EVs and bitcoin mining (j/k) they can supply electricity via nuclear power plant unless Tesla innovates faster via solar renewables. We had nuclear power and the liberals said no. very expensive... nothing like natural gas. Bottom Line. The turn around of this company is not just about ""cleaning up the mess"". It is about competing with their disrupters. This is where Cathie Wood is right (I don't own a single share of her ETF). GE could be obsolete in 10 years. Can Larry turn GE into an innovation company like it once was, remember this was the company of Edison... OMG. I am gonna say NO because all the young bright minds don't want to work for GE. I love GE, that's my generation Apple. But to young kids they would rather work for amazon or tesla etc... GE doesn't have the same pop like it once did so it will lose out on talent acquisition and there lies the death of this company. Btw, this applies to all legacy companies but they just don't have a mountain of debt like GE so they will last another 30 years vs GE only 5 years and then done. I am making broad statements here with some exaggeration to make the point... u can hopefully piece this together.

More than enough cash cushion. The redemption will improve GECC's profit by $444 million annually. Historically, 5% Pref Stock payments have been recorded on GECC's income statement within a line item called ""Other Continuing Operations"". The redemption also makes it very possible GECC breaks even / profitable in 2021, meaning GECC no longer is a negative value, but its $13.5B equity contributes to GE's enterprise value as LTC liabilities have been contained / funded over past 24 months and GECC's cash balances of $15B are sizeable and separate from GE Industrial's $20B cash balance post 5% Pref redemption. Finally, the 5% Pref Stock redemption improves GE Industrial's Debt to Ebitda ratio by 0.5 point to , much closer to the 2.5-to-1.0 target, which should be 3.0-to-1.0 this year and achieved mid-2022.",0.9077

The merger is expected to create a stronger, more diversified transportation and logistics company.Raymond T. Betler, president and CEO of Wabtec, said: “The DOJ’s decision to close its review of the pending merger marks a significant milestone for our customers, employees, and shareholders. By bringing together GE Transportation, a global digital industrial leader and supplier to the rail, mining, marine, stationary power and drilling industries, with Wabtec’s broad range of freight, transit and electronics solutions, we will have the capability and expertise to invent smarter ways to move and improve the world.”The transaction, which will position Wabtec as a Fortune 500 company with operations in more than 50 countries, is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2019, subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions. Once the transaction is completed, the combined company is expected to have significantly expanded margins, a highly attractive profile based on an improved business mix, expanded global reach, and faster innovation in key growth areas.",0.9938

There are $1.3 billion non recurring charges last year now going to the GE bottom line.3) pensions: every 1/4% (quarter point) upward inflation interest improves GE pension fund by 2.4 billion.

Since we see interest rates moving upward - every point would benefit GE $10 billion or about another 10% in their pension obligation.

He understates.He veers to giving clear and honest statements.The ""experts"" are selling themselves as ""experts"".They shoot with hardly any facts That is because they can not be called out.Neither you or I can reach them so they can hide ad after say they were wrong or surprised or even worse - claim they knew.I think Culp knows a lot more than the ""experts"". I project he will get closer to $3 billion profit in the 4th quarter 2020.If that was just $3 billion FCF for the 4th quarter - it would be no news.But Culp also told us the 2021 year they would be profitable all quarters.Simple math would take the FCF for 2021 to around $10 billion .At 20 times per share or a multiplier of $1.10 per share profit for 2021- the stock would be least at a $20 price.It is fashionable to under-estimate the number and then act surprised when the company exceeds the 9 cents a share on Tuesday.In this case the public already knows what the number will be ($2.5 billion) or maybe even more.So Tuesday either General Electric matches the estimated $783,000 profit predicted by ""experts"", and we find Culp is a basket case and does not know what the numbers he promised are actually supposed to be.Or Culp told us the profit was going to be at least $2.5 billionMy money is on Culp.

5144,"Here s the psychology of buying stocksHave you ever looked into the fresh shallow water in a clear pool or stream and seen a school of fish swimming in mass.The second one fish senses anything wrong - the whole school swims as fast A POSSIBLE AWAY FROM THE DANGER.After 10 minutes pass and the school of fish feel safer, they will return and go on with their own world.So this pattern is exactly how stock trades. All stock sales (buying or selling) are motivated by either greed or fear.Like the fish, the moment a group hears something to fear- they dump stock and head to a safe place like money on the sidelines.But it is always inevitable that after a short while, perhaps after a few trading sessions, the greed takes over and a lot of people buy stocks. The reason the above is so important is the understanding on how stocks move up and down.Nhat no stock can keep moving in an upward direction. At some point it becomes overpriced and people start to sell. The real result is the stock moves up and down dozens of cycles each day.It takes time to get accustomed to a higher price for any stock. A buyer is weighing the price against the higher greed price. As the stock drops, the buyer is consumed with greed and buys. But the stock also moves the other way.So when I hear someone want a stock to move a point in a day for a $13 stock - that is very unusual. I thing a 5% move in any stock in any day is far more that I want to see. And it is mostly true that few stocks can support 4 or 5 upward sessions without dropping back to a lower level before they move u again.GE hs risen in the past 26 weeks from $6 to $13. That is more than doubled ans there is not actual higher earnings to support the move.There is a lot of buzz that the stock is moving up to at last $20 a share so the last couple of dollars stock price movement is mostly the belief that better times are coming up.Nothing wrong with hope as long as you don't get consumed that GE will be $13.50 next week, $14 the following week, and then be at $15 by the mid April.It takes time and a balance emotional investor to ride a rising stock and ""know when to hold and when to fold"".For now GE is a ""hold"" - but t some time in the distant future it will reach a point where it will be a ""fold them"".Greed and fear always dictate the situation.",0.9973

5377,"What GE really needs to do to accelerate its growth rate and strengthen its technology leadership in the entire tech sector is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for GE (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if GE just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem.

How much have you made or lost or even better3. What fundamentals and or beliefs are you trading on...They simply ignore the questions I suspect because the answers are1. They are not holding a position...they are just angry they lost money on GE a long time ago or are disgruntled ex employees2. They have not lost any money because they do not currently hold a position3. They will not answer this because there is not a single fundamental pointing towards a lower price. They believe that because GE was bad 2 years ago it is still bad. And one time in history has nothing to do with nowI am trading on the following fundamentals1. FCF and profitability is dramatically improving2. The company has resolved the largest liabilities and although there are a few unresolved issues...they are not significant3. Culp has focused on and prioritized the best opportunities and executed4. Covid numbers are dramatically decreasing and travel is going to be a huge upside for GE5. Culp keeps under promising and over delivering6. Even large droves of millennial investors are recognizing the upside opportunity and are coming to the table7. Institutional investors will start jumping back in as the fundamentals continue to improve8.

5563,So i've sadly been involved with many reverse split companies and the stats are mind numbingly bad. Typically they go down in price till the reverse split then continue down afterwards. You have to keep buying without looking at the dwindling account till one day the price moves decisively back up and then you can get out with your shirt still on. But only if you keep averaging down and they dont go BK. This said reverse splits are typically reserved for companies with shares below a buck and in a struggling or very competitive environment. Then or of course theres corrupt management. Example Look at FCEL energy two 1 for 12 reverse splits in the last i think 4 years. Sure it popped up to 30 per share recently now back to 16.50. If you bought 100 shares in 1992 when the company first started they were trading at 207.00 per share. You held thats 20.700 invested. Two one for twelve splits now you got 4.16 shares. Ill let you do the math but it over 5000 per share for you to break even. My advice is to wait till after the split and wait more till after it tanks further then consider a long position or avoid this issue all together.If you have strong conviction just make sure you keep adding if your in love here. Full disclosure I hold no position in GE and after this blunder would only play the volatility through options. I took the time to to post this because of my experience with reverse splits. For a time it seemed like I was cursed and every stock I bought would would announce a reverse split then go bankrupt. Most recent example CHK a 1 for 200 RS. Yeah I was in that one to.I hope all make money here.Cheers,0.9961

5686,Guys Very soon Revese split will be Called OFF and you know what will happen Price will be 90 Without even revers split.,0.4354
5687,So i've sadly been involved with many reverse split companies and the stats are mind numbingly bad. Typically they go down in price till the reverse split then continue down afterwards. You have to keep buying without looking at the dwindling account till one day the price moves decisively back up and then you can get out with your shirt still on. But only if you keep averaging down and they dont go BK. This said reverse splits are typically reserved for companies with shares below a buck and in a struggling or very competitive environment. Then or of course theres corrupt management. Example Look at FCEL energy two 1 for 12 reverse splits in the last i think 4 years. Sure it popped up to 30 per share recently now back to 16.50. If you bought 100 shares in 1992 when the company first started they were trading at 207.00 per share. You held thats 20.700 invested. Two one for twelve splits now you got 4.16 shares. Ill let you do the math but it over 5000 per share for you to break even. My advice is to wait till after the split and wait more till after it tanks further then consider a long position or avoid this issue all together.If you have strong conviction just make sure you keep adding if your in love here. Full disclosure I hold no position in GE and after this blunder would only play the volatility through options. I took the time to to post this because of my experience with reverse splits. For a time it seemed like I was cursed and every stock I bought would would announce a reverse split then go bankrupt. Most recent example CHK a 1 for 200 RS. Yeah I was in that one to. I hope all make money here. Cheers,0.9965

Another elite company that provides tuition reimbursement is Mattress Firm.If I were a present day high school graduate... Who cares about $15.00 per hour flipping burgers or picking up trash in a Food Lion parking lot. A good percentage of parents have not invested in 529 plans; nor have they put back for education.When I went to work for GE back in the day; I had $300.00 to begin my education. GE provided some flexibility in my schedule as long as I worked my 40 hours and my portion of required overtime. GE took care of the rest of my tuition as long as there was a Grade C or above. HATS off to GE for helping me develop my career via tuition reimbursement. I wouldn't have pursued a post high school graduation without it.EVEN IF YOU GET A $15.00 MINIMUM WAGE; you will only be satisfied for a short time.

Moreover, its efforts are on track to reduce the exposure to the GE Capital business. For 2021, it anticipates adjusted earnings per share of 15-25 cents. Industrial organic revenues are predicted to increase in low-single digits in the year, while adjusted organic margin is expected to expand 250 basis points.

6491,"Here is something to watch carefully.With the news just announced that General Electric was moving half the GE Capital sales for 2020 to AerCap of Ireland, it may remove $4 billion of GE Capital sales on a $10 billion total volume in 2020.And it would also remove the GE loss on their balance sheet of $785 million on the $1.8 billion loss for GE capital in 2020.It would also remove GE borrowing $5 billion to support GE Capital (GECAS is their leasing aircraft portfolio in General Electric).What does all this mean.. Unless you really understand GE Capital as a stand alone unit - it is impossible to understand the effect on General Electric.But there are three things known for sure..... It will cut the GE debt by at least $5 billion. It will cut the inter-company loans between GE and GE Capital which has always been totally confusing.and It will definitely remove as much as $1.8 billion loss in 2020 from the FCF on the GE balance sheet.It is a lot of Harry Houdini I am sure - but to the analysts and the public anything to make the GE balance sheet simpler and anything to remove a negative FCF from the GE Capital division is positive for the GE price.And don't expect any help from the Stephen Tusa JP Morgan bear who is predicting a $5 stock or any other analyst. They a pathetic. All they can scream is too much debt, too little Free Cash Flow, not diversified enough since they have sold off lots and shrunk the company, and now Tusa's ridiculous statement that he is worried about a totally acceptable 81% pension funding. I am convinced they have never read the 10K quarterly filings. One lady analyst in December even said on The Street on TV that trying t understand GE financials is just too complicated for her. She doesn't read them!That is the poor quality you are relying on to handle your money and your investments. Pitiful..The next question will be the new Free Cash Flow number for 2021 and how the Wednesday March 10th conference will present their projectionsPerhaps the announcement a month ago the the FCF would be $2.5 to $4.5 billion was accurate then.But does that mean the next Culp prediction this week will now be adding the $1.8 billion GE Capital loss into his thinking and therefore making the new FCF now a $4.5 to $6.5 billion for this year?Remember when you are working with a $75 billion sales for 2020 company that was recently $100 billion in yearly sales in 2018 - it takes very little to return the company to over a dollar a share profit. Part is actual earning and part is just plain how you report the sales and costs. I business we call it the cut line or how the results for the quarter and year re accounted for.Add to that the potential for upward pricing Renewables, and power, and the normal understatement by Culp in predicting results - this could be a game changer. It could put the profit FCF potentially at maybe $7 billion or more and that would mean around $0.80 a share.At 8o cents a share - and using the very conservative 20 times earnings would translate into $16 a share and at 25 times earning it would easily come in at $20 stock price sometime mid 2021.So the AerCap announcement is really a dynamite blast if it means what I think it means.Culp is removing losers from his balance sheet and that makes the stock power upward.So this deal is very mysterious but it appears to move GE into a far better space with GE capital and GECAS - their airplane leasing division. It remove the 1,600 aircraft presently financed by GE on their balance sheet.",0.9973

6540,"A Little Common Sense is needed now....Lets take a look at General Electric Free Cash Flow for the past 5 yearsThere a basically 4 areas of FCF that GE can make a real profit.It need to make $8.8 billion of 2021 to be at $1 a share profit which would translate into a $20 stock at a 20 times earnings pe ratioAviation FCF has hovered at around $5.34 billion (2016), $5.34 billion (2017), $6.46 billion (1918), $6.82 billion (2019, and $2.44 billion (2020).Health FCF has hovered at around $3.10 billion (2016), $3.48 billion (2017), $3.7 billion (2018), $3.9 billion (2019) and was only $3.1 billion (after Bio Pharma sale in 2020)Renewables FCF has hovered at around $631 million (2016), $583 million (2017), $287 million (2018), $-666 loss (2019), and $-715 loss (2020) Power has hovered at around $4.19 billion (2016), $1.95 billion (2017), (-808 million (loss 2018), $386 million (2019), and $274 million (2020)Something to consider. Renewables had losses in 2018and 2019 when they were spending $500 million creating and improving in their wind turbines in their plants. They have perfected the radical game changing Halaide 13W and installed a test model in Rotherdam. If they had not spent that $500 million money their figures would be close to a break even. For my part - I am all for the expense if it leads to progress and profit.The point of all the above is to see that s the world returns to pre pandemic it is not a far reach for GE to achieve their $8.8 billion FCF this year in 2021 and the stock to return to $20 a share.You can add to that three things.Payroll was halved, GE now tops anyone in renewables and there fore will be profitable going forward at perhaps 5% to 8%, and Aviation has a lot of existing and very stable military and commercial engine service contracts to keep them profitable - not to mention Rolls Royce and Pratt & Whitney are seriously wounded financially and reputation going forward.Also three other important changes are the reduction of long term debt, the taking control of GE Capital and reducing that independent part of the company's exposure, and also important definitely getting a reduction on paying into their pension fund more money to get them at least 81% funded.And lastly the management change has given General Electric a whole new culture and direction. Culp underpromises and over performs. I love the surprises that proel the stock up a point or more.What can anyone subtract from the above numbrs and direction to prove to me that GE's future is not only a $20 stock - but more likely in 2022 a $30 stock as they improve their Free Cash Flow.",0.9924

With billions of shares in a shrinking company and the stock so low in price, now is the best time to buy back like 250 million shares at a minimum.

In addition, the total order backlog for the division stands at approximately $18 billion. This is comprised of 1,800 new locomotives orders and modernization of 1,000 locomotives. As a result, we expect the Transportation EBITDA to come in at around $1.05 billion in 2018.

A strong GE has great benefit to the American economy and can be of great benefit to American citizens as an employer. Welch and Immelt and many like them in corporate America think too much about how to gather wealth from stock options on the backs of shareholders and not enough about how to build shareholder equity and buy their shares on the open market the way common shareholders do. The best run publicly traded companies in America limit the use of stock options as a form of compensation, limit dilution of common shareholders, limit the need for share buybacks of the share dilution caused by issuing shares for stock options, and grow shareholder equity and the ability to pay a dividend with growing positive cash flow. The excessive use of stock options in publicly traded companies concentrates wealth into the executives who have the power to reward themselves in that way, dilutes common shareholders, and robs shareholders of the opportunity for a dividend or reinvestment by the use of cash to buy back the shares they issued to themselves to overcompensate themselves for no productive difference or better performance; furthermore, this bad widespread practice incentivizes risks that do not justify the rewards for shareholders and are only justified by the recipients of stock options.",0.9954

Then hits again and bounces up again.An that is the pattern f fear and greed.None of the past 2 days trading means anything because there is nothing fundamental involved.General Electric is the same company it was on Monday. The same!JB Morgan analyst Steven Tusa is an idiot and Ed Miller of Train Capital who on the GE board basically said so.Steven Tusa spins the story that GE stock will be $5 - the great MYTH the same way Trump says the election was stolen and he won - the GREAT STEAL. Both are fabrications looking for fools....Yes the last $20 billion of GE Capital will be debt on the company books directly now. But there is also a $21 billion asset in the AerCap stock - the 111 million shares of AerCap stock owned by GE. The change in the financials is zero. Zero. Zero.Steven Tusa says GE will be 8 times indebted in capital debt to capital assets.. That is simply a lie.GE Capital is $115 billion. GE debt shoud now be around $25 billion left after the AerCap deal and they are heading to 2.5:1 - debt to profit ratio.That means if GE returns to $10 billion FCF in 2022 and owed $25 bilion in debt - that is a true 2.5:1 debt of profit ratio.But never forget that GE has uncommitted with assets unused. Tthe Baker stock is sellable at $7 billion.The AerCap stock will be sellable at about $21 billion. And there is still on standby $45 billion cash against their $70 billion debt.So play with your numbers, throw a fit, sell and scream, but nothing will changeSame for the 8:1 reverse split. Everyone is in a ""tizzy"" for nothing. General Electric will be the same the day after the split happens.And that split will definitely be for the best as we get rid of all the Robinhood traders.Today the volume was just under 300 million shares traded.I never thought the e were that many buyers of GE stock. That today volume represents 1/25th of all GE stock traded today.Since over 60% is locked up in long term funds pension and hedge fund holdings - it really unveils how many day traders and unsophisticated trders are out there.

I have to say Culp doing a great job and in time I believe with a small raise in dividend and a few less shares we will see the teens again...... But Now is the time for share buy back not when its more money, look at the last buy back, lets not wait till its too high again !!!

Then Assistant U.S. Attorney General Demers noted at that time, “The indictment alleges a textbook example of the Chinese government’s strategy to rob American companies of their intellectual property and to replicate their products in Communist Chinese factories, enabling Communist Chinese companies to replace the American company first in the Chinese market and later worldwide.”Looking back a bit further, yet contemporaneous with the activities of Ng, we see that in October 2018, Chinese Ministry of State Security officer was arrested in Belgium and then subsequently extradited to the United States for his part in targeting and attempting to steal trade secrets and intellectual property from GE aviation.ALARM BELLS FOR COMPANIESWhile it is heartening to note the three separate efforts to steal General Electric’s technologies resulted in indictments, alarm bells should be sounding for every defense contractor regardless of sector.The alarm?
