0,Just imagine what this company could have been. It's not just about what you lost but what you could have made. Before they did the APC deal they had a pristine balance sheet and was deservedly proud of it. Proclaiming that they wanted to keep it that way and promised to look after the hefty 5% dividend. Promised they would take care of shareholders. Never do anything to jeopardize the balance sheet. Promise. Then what do the idiot CEO do? Exactly what they had been promising not to do. Destroy the balance sheet with a completely misguided buyout of APC. Yet after all of this the CEO remains.,0.9587
1,"Carl Icahn knows he is going to jail or worse and is getting ready to bail to his bunker along with every other mill/billionaire pedodevilworshiper on the planet. Quantum financial reset in progress and gitmo is overflowing. Fed is toast, 1 for 1 cash exchange but all dealers and trafficers will be wiped out, watch them resign and run. Who has resigned recently? Mainstream will not report it.",0.0249
2,"Everyone keeps mentioning the debt incurred with the Anadarko purchase. While the timing was not good, OXY picked up a significant asset with huge revenue potential. OXY could also do a capital raise on the open market by selling additional stock, which could be justified based off total combined asset values. This would result in share dilution, but they could potentially pay off all outstanding debt and at the same time keep their assets intact and not be forced to sell them off.",0.9406

7,The biggest problem for shareholders is the complete flip from low debt and being able to pay dividends even in low oil price environment to this big acquisition and huge debt.

9,"This is Lehman of oil, they got nobody to blame than themselves with that acquisition. Once Icahn bails on the commons at small loss, you will know its over before it’s officially over. Buffet will get stock quarterly and unload at his 10% premiums adding to dilution. Oil is not moving in time to save them. Even in a $30 oil environment with this balance sheet it’s just prolonging the end. What else do they have to do to signify they are toast, they crushed the payroll, cancelled the dividend and yes it will be fully cancelled by q3. I think the CEO is working for free at this point. Once this tests 9$ again it’s not hitting double digits again.",-0.2329

14,"Just some musings; Oil production has been in a massive decline for 3 months. OPEC+ has reduced production by 'Professed 9.7mb. U.S. production has dropped by nearly 3 million barrels. SA dropped another 1 million for a short time. All domestic producers have ground Capex to near $0. They also are projecting that Capex stays down for an extended time, at least a year. Not one, not 5, but nearly All domestic producers. To add to this, Bankers are wary of issuing cheap debt for oil. Its going to be much higher interest rates, and difficult to run through the hoops. This has already happened. Banks will NOT save the smaller producers so that they can 'Ride' out the storm. This in turn will continue the pressure of BK. Now, here's the Nugget;The 'Bigs' might acquire these BK wells, but they aren't going to reopen them any time soon. Money is not cheap right now. And there is a reason these firms went BK, relative high cost of production. This is going to change the landscape of domestic oil IMO. There is going to be a lot of long term shut ins. The 'Bigs' just wont reopen them until profitable. $50-$60/oil. (IMO this is sustained in 12 months, no later). By then, the consumption machine will have cleared its tailpipes and the reality of consumption going into summer '21 will be upon the world. But, production will be lagging. Maybe not by much at that time, but the drawdowns will create enormous pricing support.This brings me to OXY, who knows what they sell off. Who knows how much dilution will become reality. But, OXY is Much larger today, and even after divestment of assets, than they were a year ago. $60/SP a year ago will most likely be here again in 1 year. And with $100 oil, and rising, $80 OXY is a reasonable target.Just a thought.",0.972
15,"Here's a puzzle for all of you, whether long or short:OXY January 2022 $22.50 calls closed at $5.07 each. Bid $4.50; offered $5.50.Now how much would a July 2027 $22 call -- reflecting another 5.5 years of possible stock movement -- be worth today, given the implied vol above? Here's a hint: the value rises with the time frame.Think about it, because I think I just got a very nice present courtesy of Carl Icahn. Indeed I'll buy more Monday morning, just to let him know I like presents like this.",0.9821
16,"I don’t care where oil is at, oxy will not move up unless they work on their debt especially the 2021 debt I don’t know how much is due. If that happens and they pay 2021 debt this will easily be a $20 stock. Until then $13-16 range.",-0.1827

In short they're producing more product for less capex..... efficiency is improving partially due to better results from synergies after the anadarko deal.,0.9407
20,"Don't forget about Libyas oil blockade...""Libya's port blockade is set to keep the North African country's oil off the market until at least the fourth quarter of 2020, which, as devastating as it will be for Libyan oil revenues, could help reduce the expected global production glut by 65 percent, Rystad Energy said on Friday.""""With no immediate return of Libyan oil on the market, the expected global production surplus later this year could be just 58.6 million barrels or about one-third of Rystad Energy's previous forecast.""",0.5614

Whether this relative newfound strength in price of OXY shares has merit or not only time will tell. I still believe WTI is destined to trade at $70 in the near future and that OXY may reach $38- $40 per share when that happens, but I also believe that for OXY to really become an investment grade company, regardless of the going price of WTI it is imperative that it lower its debt load by about 30% during 2021. Failing to do that I believe OXY will be sentenced by the marketplace to trade rangebound between $22 to $30 per share. I also believe that as long as WTI stays above $60 the current OXY share price below $30 makes it an attractive candidate to be taken over by one of the major oil companies.",0.9629

Icahn's position is interesting but again, I think with his board access he's protected unlike common shareholders. I have 0 doubt OXY as a company will survive and thrive, but I do have significant doubt that they won't wipe out common shareholders along the way. Even though oil futures are recovering, there's significant challenge to the current cash flow. Huge volatility isn't much better than low prices for a company. Hedges included, $30 is still sustenance level - and OXY isn't lean enough for sustenance only.With the entire market on steroids, I just see no benefits to long term gambling on the stock.

Crude prices on Thursday opened higher on strength in the monthly U.S. payroll report, which was positive for economic growth and energy demand. Crude oil prices extended their gains Thursday afternoon on a decline in active U.S. oil rigs.Thursday's U.S. monthly payroll report was supportive of economic growth and energy demand after Jun non-farm payrolls rose +4.8 million, stronger than expectations of +3.23 million. Also, the June unemployment rate fell to 11.1%, showing a stronger labor market than expectations.Comments on Thursday from Russian Energy Minister Novak were supportive for crude prices when he said the global oil supply this month may match demand, or even drop below, ""given the ongoing easing of lockdowns in many countries.""Other U.S. economic news on Thursday was mixed for crude prices. U.S. weekly initial unemployment claims fell -55,000 to 1.427 million, showing a weaker labor market than expectations of 1.350 million. May factory orders rose +8.0%, weaker than expectations of +8.6%.Crude prices extended their gains Thursday afternoon after weekly data from Baker Hughes showed that active U.S. oil rigs fell by -3 rigs in the week ended Jul 2 to an 11-year low of 185 rigs.Global economic news was positive for economic growth and energy demand. China Jun auto sales rose +11% y/y to 2.28 million, the third straight monthly increase. Also, the Eurozone May unemployment rate rose +0.1 to 7.4%, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of +0.4 to 7.7%.Crude prices still have carry-over support from Wednesday's weekly EIA inventory data that showed crude inventories tumbled -7.20 million bbl, a much bigger decline than consensus of -800,000 bbl.Wednesday’s weekly EIA data showed that U.S. crude oil inventories as of June 26 were +15.1% above the seasonal 5-year average. U.S. crude production in the week ended June 26 was unchanged w/w at 11.0 million bpd, which was down by -2.1 million bpd (-16.0%) from Feb's record-high of 13.1 million bpd. Factors to consider:1) The OPEC+ production cut agreement of 9.7 million bpd for May-June and the deal to extend that cut in July at 9.6 million bpd, (2) The decline in U.S. and global oil production that is being forced by market conditions such as near-full oil storage facilities and a general lack of buyers.(3) The slump in active global oil rigs to a 21-year low, which will lead to lower global crude output.(4) The sharp decline in OPEC crude output as OPEC June crude oil production fell -1.93 million bpd to a 29-year low of 22.62 million bpd.(5) Hopes that China might eventually start importing U.S. crude oil on a larger scale after the mid-Jan U.S./China phase-one trade deal called for China to boost its purchases of U.S. energy products by $52 billion over the next two years.(6) The sharp drop in Iranian oil production due to U.S. sanctions and in Venezuelan oil production due to U.S. sanctions and domestic turmoil.",-0.9964

423,"""Oxy Adds to Cuts and Icahn Wins Board AppointmentsOxy stated Wednesday that it will now reduce its 2020 capital spending to approximately $2.5 billion. The firm explained the revised figure represents a decrease of $2.7 to $2.9 billion from its original 2020 guidance of $5.2 to $5.4 billion. The 2020 capital budget projection in place from March 17 until Wednesday’s announcement ranged from $3.5 to $3.7 billion. Oxy noted that its most recent $2.5 billion capex budget amounts to “a midpoint reduction of 47 percent” against the original target.According to Oxy, the company now expects 2020 annual production from continuing operations – at current commodity prices – to range from 1.275 to 1.305 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). That equates to a six-percent decrease from prior guidance ranging from 1.36 to 1.39 million boepd, the firm added.Oxy also stated that it will reduce its 2020 operating and corporate costs by at least $600 million against the original 2020 plan. The cuts include “significant salary reductions for executive leadership,” the firm noted. In addition, it pointed out the opex and corporate cost reductions augment $1.1 billion in previously announced operating and overhead cuts that should be fully implemented this year.The company also stated that it expects its “combination of synergy realizations and additional cost reductions” to yield approximately $500 million in future quarterly run-rate costs in selling, general and administrative (SG&A), other operating expense and exploration overhead. The firm noted that it anticipates 2020 domestic operating costs to fall to approximately $7 per barrel of oil equivalent given the newly announced operating cost reductions.""https://www.rigzone.com/news/oxy_adds_to_cuts_and_icahn_wins_board_appointments-26-mar-2020-161513-article/",0.9754

C) It is not in the interest of banks for the price of oil to remain at these levels because it would result in oil companies not being able to refinance the $trillions that are coming due in the next 2 years thus causing enormous losses to the banks and financial institutions holding those debt instruments.There is a natural price for a barrel of oil where everything stated above comes into balance and does not create undue hardship to any of the players.

462,"@Georges valuationOxy made an ill timed over valued acquisition in May 2019. The market punished it and its stock went from 70 to 40. So the market priced OXY post acquisition including the debt and what have you at 40. We know what valuation the market stamped on this deal. So it’s futile to try to assert otherwise. 3 variables changed since then, oil prices, divestitures and its ability to service the debt. Oil prices are on their way up. Whether this is sustainable or not is a different topic. So OXY is essentially a play on the recovery of oil prices. Think of it as a free option because Oxy has no debt maturing in 2020. So you have a free option. If oil prices rise Oxy will rise exponentially. If they stall...oxy will stay range bound. Finally by 2021 the debt advisors... Moellis should have pushed the debt maturing in 2021 and 2022 to later maturities... and things will be fine.",0.2088

564,"@Bob C - (Paraphrased from Bloomberg report) A three-part unsecured offering includes a five-year bond with a yield of 7.75% to 8%. A seven-year note may yield between 8.25% and 8.5%, while a 10-year security may yield 8.75% to 8.875%... That is a great deal,IMHO, because it is unsecured.

OXY also has 5 B$ credit line with a bank, so approx 7.3 B$ available to retire all of 6.5 B$ bond retirement for 2021.In addition 50 %of WES and 10% of PAA will amount to more than 3 B$, sale of land to Wyoming will derive another 1 B$. This is enough to retire 2022.Buffett will gain a lot with more shares added to his cuddy every quarter, but regular investors with access only to common stock will reap larger gains.The oil rigs are going at such a faster pace and none of it will be profitable for anyone other than 3 big players at below 40$.

603,"Came across this by someone with the nick ""True Texan"". It sounds interesting. Because Icahn publicly increased his stake, I think OXY's chance of bankruptcy is low unless we are heading to a deep recession where every country in the world shuts down for more than one year. Right now it seems like that because we are full with fear. I think dilution is very likely because OXY will need an investor to support it during this price war or it will get low interest loan from the bank with support from the government.Already happened > March OPEC+ negotiations break down. Both sides talk about flooding the market, long war ahead, investing to increase production capacity. In response, prices collapse and US shale players finally announce plans to slash CAPEX by 25-40%. Prices stabilize, as do E&P equities.- Occurring as we speak > Saudis loading tankers with oil from storage, sending an extra 2 million per day into already over-supplied markets. UAE joins their KSA ally in adding supply to the market. Saudis drop selling prices to key markets, to ensure Saudi barrels are bought at the margin compared to Russian ones. These are all highly visible, Shock & Awe type moves. Interestingly, crude oil prices and E&P equity prices remain relatively stable despite this expected onslaught of Middle Eastern crude.- What isn't happening at the moment > despite their bravado, no true investment in new productive capacity is being pursued by any of the players involved in the battle. In fact, Saudi Aramco just announced its plans to slash its budget for the rest of the year by 25% - consistent with other E&P players, but in conflict with what MBS and the Saudi Oil Minister were proclaiming about investing to get capacity up to 13 million barrels.- So, what will transpire near-term > COVID-19 takes 3-4 million barrels of demand out of the market. Additional and unwanted Saudi barrels will flow into visible supply hubs, like the US Gulf Coast, ballooning inventories and causing prices to slide still further, putting pressure on both Russia and USA shale players and diminishing both sides’ will to continue the price war as well as their financial wherewithal to invest in new production capacity.- But mid-term (say summer) > the effects of COVID-19 start to fall off in the US and Europe, as they've already done in the early epicenters like China and Korea. Global demand starts to return to normal levels, with possible rapid upswings as global citizens take to the roads and skies to celebrate survival! The Saudi's quietly reduce tanker loadings and compel the Russians and OPEC to return to the negotiating table, with all players clearly having seen the darkness at the bottom of the abyss and having a renewed spirit of cooperation and making a deal. Some sort of production cut is agreed. But the need for that cut is now far less, as USA shale production is peaking and heading south (quickly) as shale wells have high natural decline rates and the overall shale portfolio declines without high levels of sustaining capital investment, which have now been cut. Crude prices start heading back towards $50.- Come the fall, the USA shale output decline continues (and potentially accelerates). Analysts start to forecast a significant supply shortfall in 2021, with wounded shale players trying to balance the need to reinvest in their declining production base while hoarding cash to repair their balance sheets. Prices start to head towards $75-80 and OPEC+ starts to reduce its supply holdback into the market.- In the end, everyone benefits - MBS re-establishes Saudi power in managing OPEC+, and it is producing close to capacity at $80 pricing. Putin and his oil oligarchs benefit too, with prices now double what they essentially had been, supply constraints removed, and pesky USA shale players effectively out of the game to cause over-supply/low prices for years to come. Even USA shale players benefit - yes, their production base is down by 10-15%, but they too are benefiting from the higher prices in the market and the capital discipline that was imposed on them via the market, but essentially driven by MBS and Putin.Moreover, the Climate Change loud-mouths (like Bernie and Warren) are sidelined while those who survive the outbreak are glad to be alive and are focused more on a return to normalcy rather than some battle against unknown and unseen existential threats that the Progressive Socialists want us to imagine are lurking around the corner.",0.9971

810,"""Rob Peterson -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks, Raphael. So just historically, the company is not one that's regularly engaged in hedging, preferring to realize the prices over the cycle, that delivers the most buyer shareholders. But we did, to your point, with our increased leverage, take on an oil hedge in 2020 that had a collar in 2020, but then it also had a call provision in 2021. So the only thing remaining from that oil hedge is the call provision in 2021.We have put in place, as the slide deck shows, Slide 20, natural gas hedges for 530 million standard cubic per day as of 12.31 with a value between 2.50 and 3.64 on a costless basis, similar to a cost of basis we had on the hedge oil last year. There's no extending call option though on that oil -- on the gas side. We continue to evaluate additional hedges, particularly on the oil side on a regular basis. We evaluate the cost of doing so versus not doing so.As you can imagine, we do a pure put. It's still fairly expensive despite the improvement in price. And a costless type color hedge is going to require both the cap in the current year in addition to the one we have hanging over us today last year's hedge, extending one into 2022. And so we look at the -- we moved the debt maturities down quite a bit in the near term, which is somewhat of a hedge against downturns in the business in the near term.We also know that shareholders appreciate our heavy exposure, leverage to oil price. And so we have not put something in place as of now, but we're going to kind of continue to evaluate them and see if they're going to be constructive in the future.""",0.2129

So BK was on the horizon because Williams was cut off from credit renewal. In comes Warren with a $3.8 billion bailout package.

831,"Drawbacks to electric vehicles:1. Range. Miles it can go without re-charging. 130-260 miles.2. Re-charging times. 80% re-charge in 20 to 30 minutes at best.3. Trip planning problems. You need to know where the re-charging stations are and the weather conditions.4. Electric vehicles are only practical in urban areas.5. Environmental damage. Lithium batteries are not re-cyclable and increases demand for more electricity (provided by nuclear plants).6. Expensive.7. Repair difficulties. If you own an electric car, you can forget going to your local shop or fixing it inexpensively. Regardless of the type and the model, all-electric vehicles require specific maintenance and service procedures as well as extremely high safety standards.Also, servicing electric cars can be quite dangerous because most of the car’s mechanics consist of battery packs under high voltage. Also, in case of a fire, you can’t just put it out with water. You have to use a special fire extinguisher since the batteries burn at a much higher temperature.8. Too Heavy. One of the main downsides of having a big battery pack underneath your car is the additional weight. While most modern vehicles are heavy due to all the extra safety and comfort options, electric vehicles are the heaviest champions. On smaller models like the Kia Soul EV, the electric batteries add around 450 extra pounds of weight. However, on some of the high-end models like the Tesla Model X, the battery pack weighs in at over 1,000 pounds. Also, the car itself weighs over 2.3 tons. Heavy vehicles mean more tire wear, more energy consumption, and maintenance too.9. Cold Temperature Issues. When it’s freezing outside, electric vehicles are notorious for displaying specific problems. One of the most common issues is the loss of battery power. It’s similar to old cell phones that would stop working once you took them out of your pocket in the winter. Since the bulk of the electric vehicle market is in the Northern Hemisphere where the winters are cold and snowy, cold weather battery drain can be a big problem for everyday use. Owners report a reduced range and even the failure to operate in especially harsh winter conditions.10. Low Top Speeds. Although there are some electric supercars with insane high speeds like the Rimac Concept One, most regular everyday EVs are quite slow. The top speed of the Golf E or Kia Soul EV is limited to below 100 mph, for instance.",0.763

That’s where you find true value.The truth is that oil was hurt by COVID19. The lockdowns hurt demand by 5 million barrels per day. However, since April 2020, oil demand has recovered to 96 million barrels per day - from its 2019 high of 100 million barrels per day.The price has recovered to almost $60 a barrel.As the world goes green, oil demand is expected to continue to rise by 2% annually through 2050 - this is projected by green energy companies.The combination of anti-drilling policies and rising demand creates the perfect Bull Market scenario for oil. By 2023 oil will be $100 per barrel and will range between $100-$150 per barrel through 2050.The cash generated by the high prices will be used by the oil companies to develop better green tech and to buy out existing green competitors.

961,"JP Morgan Quant Expert predicts Secular Bull Market in oil companies driven by algorithm initiated short squeeze in March 2021JPM quant trading and valuation experts Marko Kolanovic predicts the next 12 years will be the most profitable era for oil investors in the past 100 years due to inflation, the weakening US Dollar (caused by stimulus), a booming stimulus-driven recovery, and under-investment in oil production caused by environmental concerns.The fundamentals will be compounded by automatic trading by algorithm driven super-fast traders called Quants. The market will begin automatically rebalancing out of short positions in mid-March due to the recent rise in energy company stocks, oil prices and excess liquidity.The best picks to cash in on this cycle are $OXY, $XOM, $CVX, $ET, $ERX & $XLE. The following is an excerpt from his article. Quants and Momentum InvestingIn a market where algos and trend-followers have emerged as one of the dominant price-setting forces, it is hardly a surprise that the JPM quant focuses on their influence as the driver behind a commodity supercycle. Indeed, he writes that after ""CTAs played significant role in the 2014 oil price downturn"" more recently, ""CTA funds have been adding Energy exposure. The reason is that 12-month momentum turned positive on Oil, and going forward signals will remain solidly positive."" And since vol-control funds are some of the dumbest money around and their actions can be anticipated well in advance, JPM notes that ""a further decline in volatility will likely result in larger and more stable cross-asset quant allocations. A larger momentum impact may affect Energy equities, which is the only sector that still has a strongly negative momentum signal and is hence heavily shorted in the context of factor investing."" That, JPMorgan believes, will ""change in mid-March, when the momentum signal for energy equities turns positive"" which may be a hint to the redditors out there: if you want to squeeze the systematic shorts, do it where it hurts and buy some energy stocks to crush the CTAs. You have about a month to do so because JPM's model momentum factor ""will need to rebalance in March by closing ~20% of its allocation to Energy equity shorts, and adding ~2% to energy longs, for a ~22% net buying in Energy.""What is the quantitative significance of these flows? Kolanovic calculates that if one roughly assumes that there is about ~$1Tr in equity long-short quant funds and that half of these funds are not sector neutralized, ""the flows could be quite significant, roughly $20-$30bn."" As shown in the chart below, the ratio of energy shares shorted vs all other S&P 500 shares shorted, closely followed the commodity supercycle. Remarkably, most recently the number of shares shorted for energy was 4 times the S&P 500 average (note that given the decline of the sector’s weight, energy share prices declined, and the effective $ amount shorted was only 2 times larger). In other words, one doesn't even need to squeeze the shorts: come March - absent some major new crisis - as a result of broader market technicals the prevailing shorts will close them out on their own and go long.Another ""flow factor"" behind the ""supercycle"" is rotation by discretionary funds and retail: In the period from 2010 to 2015, the Energy sector had a 10.6% allocation in conventional equity portfolios. Since then, this has declined to a 3.1% weight currently (Figure 4). The largest decline was in active allocations, which declined from 7% to 1.5% (while passive allocations decreased from 3.6% to 1.8%), which is understandable - investors dumped ""dead stocks"" to chase growth and momentum, but the tide is now turning, and ""any retracement of this decline, on a US equity fund asset base of ~$14T would result in significant inflows and re-pricing."" According to Kolanovic, as economies reopen, inflation moves higher, and yield curves steepen, active funds are expected to first close cyclical shorts, and then rotate from long secular growth towards value and cyclicals. His next point is critical: given that equity assets significantly increased over the last 10 years, and the energy sector significantly decreased, even a small rotation could produce an outsized move.",0.9834

If thebstock price was below $22.00 the warrant price would basically be deemed worthless, as you could buy cheaper shares on the open market, and expire.So in theory if I thought this stock was worth, random number, $60.00, I would want to buy up any and all warrants I could for anything below $38.00. theorerical stock price ($60.00) minus warrant price ($22.00) giving me a warrant value of 38.00.Is this a correct understanding of a warrant?",0.9656

Divest assets, issue shares, or make money. I believe it’s all 3. Make $4 Billion towards debt, divest $8 billion in assets and issue $2 billion for the Warrants. That gets us to about $25 Billion in debt. That’s the number that management was chirping about. Dividend goes back to $3 as long as oil stays above $60. Vicky, IMO, will be a little slow to reinstate dividend to full measure. Better to issue $1 and only eat $250 million so as to attack the tranches the rest of the year.

However that cash is presumably coming. This is what they actually said:""Rob PetersonYes. Sure, Neil. Happy to do that for you. So, if you look at a typical first quarter, we historically see a somewhat of a significant draw in the first quarter because of the -- but it was certainly more sizable in the first quarter of this year.When you go back to 2018, Q1 withdraw about $700 million. In 2019, it was about $900 million. And for the opposite reasons of this quarter, 2020 was about $200 million draw because we price going the opposite direction, obviously, in March when the pandemic hit and with the price wars going on.So, regardless of the $1.3 billion draw we experienced in the first quarter does and is exceptionally large. The majority of that was driven by the change in commodity prices. It was the timing difference between revenue recognition and cash received. So, at the end of 2020, WTI was about $48 a barrel, and it was $61 a barrel at the end of March.

Net and core income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $706 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, and $922 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, respectively. “We’re proud to have completed another strong quarter with all three of our business segments performing exceptionally well. Occidental continues to execute on its returns-focused strategy of generating free cash flow and value-based production growth,” said President and Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub. “We returned approximately $800 million to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and share repurchases.” QUARTERLY RESULTS Oil and Gas Oil and gas pre-tax income for the first quarter of 2019 was $484 million, compared to $145 million for the prior quarter. Excluding impairment charges, oil and gas pre-tax core income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $365 million. The increase in first quarter core income, compared to the prior quarter, reflected lower depreciation, depletion and amortization rates for 2019 as well as a positive non-cash mark-to-market adjustment on carbon dioxide purchase contracts. Total average daily production volumes exceeded guidance at 719,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) for the first quarter of 2019, compared to 700,000 BOE for the fourth quarter of 2018. Permian Resources average daily production volumes came in at the high end of guidance at 261,000 BOE for the first quarter of 2019, an increase of 4 percent from the prior quarter due to improved well performance and development activity. Year-over-year, Permian Resources production for the first quarter of 2019 increased by 47 percent. International average daily production volumes exceeded guidance at 298,000 BOE for the first quarter of 2019, compared to 290,000 BOE for the fourth quarter of 2018, due to increased production in Oman.",0.9967

1169,"Overall consumption is just now starting to pick up steam. World production is being held back to the tune of 7mbd. But, lets be real. The consumption of fuel by the airlines, cruise lines, and automobile is the ultimate trigger. Non of them have opened up. It doesn't matter if you agree with opening up or not, mask or not, the economy is at the gate of oil consumption and the starting pistol is raised. Its March 9th and herd immunity by injection or otherwise is June 1st at the latest. The fuel consumption that will be embarked on will quickly and increasingly overwhelm production and drain the storage levels. Its only 2 months from here.OPEC+ is shockingly disciplined here. Holding off production will have created strong pricing support in the long run. IMO, the chart looks like another 5%+ drop to ~$60 oil. The sentiment will drop OXY well into the $27's. The 20dma is $27.11. If it falls below that, I wouldn't think it would be for very long. Intraday maybe? This week is the washout, especially with the crude build up. The herd doesn't like the build, but I ain't scared. Thats normal from a freeze standpoint. Refineries are struggling to open. They will and will catch up quickly and get back to normal. Next week and the week after should see us back to normal consumption over production ratio. Thats why I believe this week is the washout and into next week. IMO, resumption of the price runup in OIL continues. We get our storage numbers next week, and the following, and I believe we will have our trough in.IMO, the Warrants are the only play here. There is no dividend, and if you believe a dividend is coming back this year, I don't, then why own the stock on a 6+ year runway? Even if a dividend comes when we aren't looking, whats the worst that can happen? An inflation of the Warrant? Yeah, I'm looking for the reentry into Warrants. If we get down to the 20dma then the Warrants should be mid $12's or lower. Incredible entry point.

Um for me....oxy will,weaver the storm and will be the biggest profiteur of rising oil prices.Today financial times announced, that Astra Zenecas vaccine is susceessfull in last studies. WOW ...A GAME CHANGER1- Occidental PetroleumOccidental Petroleum has seen its stock price drop by more than 85% since mid-2018 on the back of what was arguably the worst acquisition of all time with Anadarko. The company has been forced to cut its dividend from $0.79 to $0.11 / quarter and cut its capital spending by ~$1.3 billion annually below its breakeven rates.However, the company's new breakeven is ""in the low $30s / barrel WTI"" not counting the company's hedges. The company's hedges, through a three-way cost less collar to add $10 / barrel for 300,000 barrels / day in production in 2020. Across the company's entire production that's nearly $3 / barrel above current prices from the hedging.That's perfect because it means the company's actual WTI breakeven is ~$28-29 / barrel WTI or ~$3-4 / barrel (~10%) below current prices. The company has significant debt, but it also has room to cut its dividend further if needed (saving ~$500 million annually if it chooses too or ~$1.5/ barrel). So the company has the financial strength to breakeven at current prices, which means while shareholder rewards won’t be there, it could weather a long oil crisis.Last, it was worth noting that previously, at $40 / barrel WTI, Occidental Petroleum was breaking even with its old dividend. At $50 / barrel WTI it could increase production. But with its old dividend at almost 30% based on current prices, and the company able to cover that at $40 / barrel WTI, that means even with a slight recovery in oil prices in 12 months, the company could generate significant shareholder rewards. Remember, we’re expecting $55 WTI by second half 2020.",0.9931

1277,"Great news all. My cart is loaded. Shares of Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) surged 1.7% in premarket trading Friday, after Susquehanna analyst Biju Perincheril said it's time to buy into the oil and natural gas exploration and production company again, citing confidence in an oil price recovery. Perincheril raised his rating to positive, after downgrading it to neutral on March 16, and boosted his stock price target by 64% to $18, from $11. Perincheril is ""increasingly confident"" that crude oil prices will rise to about $50 per barrel by the end of 2021 and into 2022 on the back of improving economic data points and recent positive news on a potential COVID-19 vaccine. ""[Occidental's] large debt burden has been a major headwind for the stock this year, but we see a line of sight to an improving leverage profile through enhanced free cash flow generation from higher oil prices,"" Perincheril wrote in a note to clients. Crude oil futures (CL00) were up 0.7% at $42.20 in recent trading. Perincheril also believes Occidental's target for $2 billion to $3 billion in asset sales could increase if the oil outlook keeps improving, which would speed up deleveraging efforts. The stock has tumbled 67.6% year to date through Thursday, while the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF (XLE) has shed 40.0%, crude futures have lost 31.0% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has gained 10.9%.",0.9803

1337,"Everyone of us should take responsibility for our own investment and understand the risk associated with it. Energy industry is a tough one to invest because each of the US oil company is a small fish comparing to two gigantic sharks (Saudi and Russia). We can't collude together and set supply target like them.All oil companies have received severe one-two punch much more severe than companies in other industries. OXY is being impacted slightly more but its peers are not better off. When there was an imminent war with Iran, OXY was applauded for making the right decision to focus mainly in the US. No one had a crystal ball to see a coronavirus in 2020 and then was followed with an impulsive decision by a 34-year old man-child.We saw news of shutdown in China early in January but we lacked the ability to see what it would be once it's being spread globally. We saw the tantrum fight between OPEC and Russia early last week but we lacked the ability to understand that we don't want to be the small guys getting trapped when two giants decided to go at each other. The warning signs were there for us to see. Investing is not easy. It requires discipline, decisiveness and the ability to connect all events together and understand how it would affect to each stock in our portfolio. IMO, OXY is one of the five lowest cost producers in the US. The risk of bankruptcy is low but you will probably see share dilution if this is prolonged enough. Good luck to any of us who are still OXY shareholders and hope the price war will end soon enough.",0.949
1338,"OXY has roughly 6.7 BILLION cubic feet of natural gas reserves. Great optimism on natural gas:1. On a BTU energy equivalent basis, natural gas should be close to $10 when oil is just at $60 a barrel. Oil is higher than that already.2. The USA really just started exporting natural gas as LNG in 2016, and capacity to export more is increasing dramatically. We already export, just via LNG, more than 10 percent of annual national production.3. Number 2 should tend to bring number 1 closer in the long term.4. The US is increasing exports to Mexico and Canada via more and more pipelines and export roughly the same amount of natural gas via pipelines as we do via LNG .5. We are building more and more natural gas electric generating plants each year and this is expected to increase right through 2050 according to the US EIA. This is long term demand growth.6. Each electric vehicle will need electricity and natural gas electric generation will be very much needed to provide greater and greater electricity supply.7. Each electric vehicle may reduce the need for so much oil and thus may result in lower associated natural gas and higher gas prices. Yet at the same time even more natural gas will be needed to produce electricity for electric cars.8. Natural gas is the most economic feedstock to produce hydrogen. Maybe the only viable feedstock.9. Bill Gates, through an investment vehicle, recently invested in technology to convert natural gas to hydrogen in a very environmentally favorable way. A possible large clean way to use natural gas.10. Numerous big companies are purchasing delivery trucks for use in the USA that run on natural gas. Amazon has recently ordered HUNDREDS of such trucks.11. Natural gas is a finite commodity with relatively inelastic demand. Not making more, but using more and more all the time all around the world. Population and electric demand are growing.12. Ethane, from natural gas is needed to make plastic.13. Wall Street appears to have had a serious aversion to natural gas producers in recent past. It appears this could be changing. It appears the only viable economic way towards a cleaner future for much of the world. The pendulum seems to be swinging favorably.14. When herd mentality changes, prices can move quite impressively.Disclaimer: Although not long OXY, I appreciate their natural gas assets, but prefer companies with less oil concentrations. I am long HGTXU, GURE, AR, and SWN all of which have natural gas reserves. I may add to, or decrease holdings at any time.

1369,"Basically Vicky turned Oxy's #$%$ as a margin account with huge debt, which means if the oil price increase substantially, the #$%$ can generate FCF immensely. If the oil stays low, FCF generation is limited and their #$%$ seems worthless. However, we should note that their asset value/size is also huge even after recognizing the significant impairment charges from Q4 2019, Q1 and Q2 2020. If the oil price is headed back to $60 or more, the asset value will be worth more than $90-100 billion. By disposing $5 billion worth of asset value from the appreciated asset value, it can take care off the near term debt and by that time, FCF will be massive that their debt will look like almost nothing and is well manageable. So, the key is where the oil price will be in next 1-2 years. My projection is that by November 2020, the oil price will be back to $50 primarily due to significant reduced production. The gasoline overall supply is now back within the 5 year moving average according to the EIA report, and the crude is also heading this direction, even though there was a slight build in this week's report. If the demand is fully recovered while maintaining the current production level, we may break the oil price beyond $100, an unthinkable oil price next 1-2 years. People will jump back for oil stocks and they will kick their butts why they did not buy any shares NOW. I think we need to be patient, relaxed and play video games while waiting.",0.9888

Icahn has filed the paperwork necessary to vacate the positions of those four Occidental board members and replace them with his own executives. “The company’s current directors have made a number of mistakes in how and at what cost they pursued the acquisition,” Icahn wrote in a filing. Occidental beat out Chevron (NYSE:CVX), which, at the time, was also pursuing Anadarko but folded at $48 billion, not willing to call. Occidental is getting a little nervous about Icahn’s maneuvering here, warning all its shareholder in ALL CAPS not to respond to any written requests from Icahn. Icahn’s rationale for opposing the deal is the volatility of oil prices. He’s been burned by oil before, most recently with his position in Chesapeake (NYSE:CHK) which is trading near all time lows.

OXY currently has a PEG ratio of 6.78.Another notable valuation metric for MRO is its P/B ratio of 0.62. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, OXY has a P/B of 1.13.These metrics, and several others, help MRO earn a Value grade of B, while OXY has been given a Value grade of C.

Now sth unexpected happened and wti went negative last year and we had to get rid of the dividend. Do I think they can reinstate dividend back to 3 to 5% absolutely. They have debt problem however they can still get rid of the African and non core assets which should amount to at least 10 billion dollars. This would leave them at 23 bil debt plus 10 bil Warren's PS. They should have 8 bil from fcf until the end of next year. That brings debt to 15 bil + 10 bil PS.

Or maybe for much longer (like HIV)? What does that mean for the demand for example next year, given that many international companies are insolvent and others have been cutting costs. At least business travel might go down and people who lost their jobs might not be able to fly, at least not so often as before.On the other hand we have historical production cuts and currently relatively low oil prices. This might for example affect or shift sales of (mostly expensive) electric vehicles and have positive long term effect on oil industry.Oil price is only one variable in the equation. Another important variable is quantity. Best case is highest oil price at max. production capacity and this might be one of the biggest uncertainties of OXY (Although first variable is affected by demand anyway). Large debt remains probably biggest pain in the neck. However, industry's recovery might make selling some of OXY's assets more probable.",0.9511

OXY has posted the ugliest of numbers, for last quarter, with FCF on deck for this quarter. Production is suppressed and reality of under Capex in the industry is going to be quite relevant and soon. IMO, end of year is going to have a substantial bullish narrative build. The pain is coming next spring/summer. By then, C19 will have taken its toll and the world will have moved on. SA and Russia will have learned their lesson, until next time, and production will be sharply lower than consumption. I see a real path to $80 oil next year. Thats $40+ million fcf per day for OXY.

1701,"That’s the gamechanger.....That will boost oxy stock price to another level up.The Federal Reserve revamped its Main Street Lending Program in ways that will allow battered oil companies to qualify for the aid after industry allies lobbied the Trump administration for changes.Larger, more heavily indebted companies can now qualify and use the money to pay off prior loans under the changes the central bank announced Thursday.The move opens the door to more oil and gas producers, said Senator Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, who had pressed the administration on the issue as energy companies struggle to survive an epic collapse in fuel demand and crude prices.“With the decrease in demand and oversupply due to the global oil price war creating a valley for these highly leveraged companies, this expansion will help them bridge the gap as we look to reopen America,” Cramer said in an emailed statement Thursday.Environmentalists blasted the shifts they said rewarded oil companies that took on too much debt and were overproducing crude even before the coronavirus pandemic caused demand to plunge.“These changes directly reflect demands from polluters and their favorite members of Congress,” said Lukas Ross with the environmental group Friends of the Earth. “Long before the coronavirus, the drillers were in deep trouble. Now frackers want to pay back their debts with our money. Trump’s big oil bailout must be stopped.”For weeks, oil industry advocates have warned the original program structure would prevent beleaguered drillers from accessing capital under the program.Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, and the Independent Petroleum Association of America argued oil companies needed more flexibility to use Main Street loans to repay existing debt -- something that was previously off limits but will now be allowed under some conditions.Maximum loan totals under the Main Street program are also being hiked to $200 million -- from an earlier $150 million cap viewed as too low to help oil producers.“Great news out of the Fed today in support of struggling U.S. energy companies,” Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said in a tweet Thursday. He added that he would “continue” his work with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to provide “other relief” to the industry.The Fed said the changes were not targeted to the oil and gas industry or any industry in particular but followed additional research into what slice of U.S. companies don’t have ready access to capital markets.Nevertheless, the new terms are likely to open it up to a wider group of energy firms, and overseers worried the Fed was bending to pressure.“The major changes announced today mirror the top requests of the oil and gas industry,” said Bharat Ramamurti, a member of the congressional panel appointed to scrutinize implementation of the Fed’s and part of the Treasury’s virus-relief programs.“That raises questions about how the changes promote the broader public interest -- especially when these companies will still have no real obligation to retain or rehire their workers,” Ramamurti said on Twitter.Credit RatingsEven before the changes, oil and gas companies with investment-grade credit ratings could secure funding through a separate program, the Fed’s Primary and Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facilities.However, under term sheets released April 9, funding was restricted to firms that had credit ratings of at least BBB-/Baa3 as of March 22 -- a cutoff date that could come too late for some oil producers, such as Occidental Petroleum Corp., which had its debt cut to junk by Moody’s on March 18, with Fitch and S&P following on March 20 and March 25, respectively.Republicans have argued that funding should be available to oil companies with credit ratings that slipped amid the coronavirus pandemic and a surge in crude unleashed by a Russia-Saudi Arabia battle for market share.On Thursday, the Fed said lenders now will be able to apply their “industry-specific expertise and underwriting standards to best measure a borrower’s income.”Highly leveraged companies also can take advantage of a new, third loan option that comes with increased risk sharing by lenders.It was not clear Thursday whether the changes would allow Occidental to qualify for aid -- or whether potentially newly eligible oil companies would seek it. Occidental declined to comment on the matter.",0.8757

From the WSJ, I won't post the link as you need to subscribe but here is the first part>>>>>""""WASHINGTON—The oil industry’s top lobbying group is preparing to endorse setting a price on carbon emissions in what would be the strongest signal yet that oil and gas producers are ready to accept government efforts to confront climate change.The American Petroleum Institute, one of the most powerful trade associations in Washington, is poised to embrace putting a price on carbon emissions as a policy that would “lead to the most economic paths to achieve the ambitions of the Paris Agreement,” according to a draft statement reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.“API supports economy-wide carbon pricing as the primary government climate policy instrument to reduce CO2 emissions while helping keep energy affordable, instead of mandates or prescriptive regulatory action,” the draft statement says.API’s executive committee was slated to discuss the proposed statement this week. In a statement to the Journal, API’s senior vice president of communications, Megan Bloomgren, said the group’s efforts “are focused on supporting a new U.S. contribution to the global Paris agreement.”Carbon pricing aims to discourage the production of harmful greenhouse gases by setting a price on emissions. The API draft statement would endorse the concept in principle, without backing a specific pricing scheme such as a carbon tax.An endorsement of carbon pricing by the oil industry’s most important trade group would underscore the changing politics of climate change, as major business groups acknowledge the dangers posed by greenhouse gases and adjust to a new reality in Washington. Another major business group, the Business Roundtable, endorsed carbon pricing last year.""""",0.992

Would love to be wrong and would enjoy my paper profits, but its not how I read this accounting sheet thats coming.IMO, the $37 Billion in net debt is so large and such an overhang that the company is forced to attack the tranches. The discipline with Capex in regards to production output gives it away from my prospective. The second reason is that does anyone care about a dividend omission for the next quarter or two with such a high debt? In other words, the dividend payments have already been obliterated. We all have already accepted no dividend for our portfolio. This has now turned into a growth stock and a survival narrative. The rise back to increased volume is the story. And that story has not begun,...... yet. To be sure, IMO, we can wring our hands with when all these metrics will be applied. But the overall story will be the same. In 12-15 months, OXY will have divested the assets they so choose. OXY, under current and rising pricing, will have eliminated ~$10 Billion+ in debt. The key is debt in the low $20's. OXY has made mention of a debt target in the low $20's. I will take them at their word. Now, that doesn't mean that a dividend raise isn't out of the equation along the way. Inching up ever so slightly. But, I believe one could conclude that the main focus is debt destruction at this point with a sprinkling of dividend along the way. They also must reinstitute Capex at some point. Bankers are nrent as excited to lend this time around and OXY would be well served to use FCF to inch their Capex up a bit each quarter. My opinion on timeline is Q3/CC announcement of reinstituting a meaningful dividend but at a much lower rate than 2019. By this time, oil should be north of $80 and world supply will be noticeably altered from todays levels. Capex will be slowly but increasingly introduced, and debt should be down to ~$30 Billion.I just don't see OXY in divestment mode until we hit the $80's in oil. If we go to $80, by summers end, then a powerful path to $100 is imminent. I believe OXY will divest at this point. Assets will be at a premium but not frothy overvalued. Time to divest. With the sale of assets and the remaining fcf for 2021, we should hit the net debt target that OXY is comfortable with to return to pre C19 dividend disbursements. By then, OXY could very well be flirting with $100+ SP within 6 months of all these points implemented. But, a dividend next month seems much too early IMO. OIL is in overbought territory and a retest of the support is on the table IMO. I believe we get a week or so of weakness only to continue the supporting rise into Spring and Summer.

It's like if you gave a calculator to someone and they tried to turn on a TV with it. What a joke.GREAT to see our performance into earnings. As I said a few weeks ago, the hardest part was making sure we held our lows in the bottom of our ranges the past 2/3 months. Consistently, the catalysts to break through the upper parts of our price ranges has been EARNINGS (which is obvious, given equity pricing under 60 dollar crude in 2018 was nearly triple for companies like CPE and CDEV).It's a no-brainer. The narrative changes every other day, and I've seen it happen -- oil down one day and it's 'Oil down due to lockdown fears.' Oil up the next and it's 'Oil up due to reopening.' For two months, the headline should actually have read 'Oil yoyo-ing due to MMs manipulating prices for paperhanded retail investors.' Now, it's time for the supercycle narrative to take heed.

After some critical news from China, WTI prices dropped last Friday, but recovered again same day, which shows some strength.Thinking oil prices will keep going down from now is somehow absurd. Largest oil buyers might be buying at this price already, otherwise they might have to pay higher price in 6 months or a year.With current Covid-19 situation people in some countries tend to think that 'the sky is falling', because of what they see in their daily lives: Everything closed, no cars, no airplane, etc. However, in countries where situation has already gotten better life is back to (a new) normal. China is probably the best example. Another example is Europe.It is not about oil, it is about energy in general. Oil is currently probably our most important source of energy.

This is not $40 oil where they are barely breaking even. Its been at or near $60 for the quarter. Its basing. Now, yes right now, its getting set to rise higher. We had a run to $65ish. A pull back is normal. Next up is $70. We are going to get there by July 1st. Most likely sooner. Then, its $80 by September. IMO, OIL waffles for all of Q4 around the $75-$80 handle. Finds a dip in Q1/22 then it can go either way from there. In any manner, OXY will report that they actually made money and this alone sill support the price. We are going back to $31 and soon. By Q2 its $40. By EOY its $50. When meaningful Dividend gets reinstated, then its anybody's guess. But, $80 oil with a divestment of projected assets and a reduction of debt to the $20's, with a dividend, will elevate the SP. If OIL is still climbing at that point? Well, SP could very well be inflated into the $80's and higher. After all, 100 million barrels of $80 oil for a quarter is $4 Billion+ in cash! Right now, they are making $2+ Billion in FCF per quarter. The market is in 'Show Me' mode right now. Put a quarter or two under our belts and the market will change to positive view of the sector. Current pricing is $10+ Billion in FCF. With a divestment or two, one would think that they will be where they need to be on the balance sheet by EOY. $10 warrants are a gift that is absurdly low.

I can remember when on days like today, OXY would be down over $1.00. I still think that until the warrants are issued on 08/03/20, and earnings are reported on 08/10/2020, it is unlikely for OXY to make a major move to the upside..

Any time there was a rise in stock price, it could have been seen by some as an indication Management is doing their job, so Icahn had to keep OXY low enough to support his argument. I also suspect a lot of the investment community press that has been critical of OXY management was also influenced by Icahn, and certainly a large part of the social media including rabid posters on this board.

They were selling oil 15-20 dollars below spot because they could not move it out of there because of the bottleneck of few pipelines. Wells have been chocked back or not finished because of that , both oil and gas wells.

2231,"Interesting news for the energy sector going forward.JP Morgan Quant Expert predicts Secular Bull Market in oil companies driven by algorithm initiated short squeeze in March 2021JPM quant trading and valuation experts Marko Kolanovic predicts the next 12 years will be the most profitable era for oil investors in the past 100 years due to inflation, the weakening US Dollar (caused by stimulus), a booming stimulus-driven recovery, and under-investment in oil production caused by environmental concerns.The fundamentals will be compounded by automatic trading by algorithm driven super-fast traders called Quants.The market will begin automatically rebalancing out of short positions in mid-March due to the recent rise in energy company stocks, oil prices and excess liquidity.The best picks to cash in on this cycle are $OXY, $XOM, $CVX, $ET, $ERX & $XLE.The following is an excerpt from his article.Quants and Momentum InvestingIn a market where algos and trend-followers have emerged as one of the dominant price-setting forces, it is hardly a surprise that the JPM quant focuses on their influence as the driver behind a commodity supercycle. Indeed, he writes that after ""CTAs played significant role in the 2014 oil price downturn"" more recently, ""CTA funds have been adding Energy exposure. The reason is that 12-month momentum turned positive on Oil, and going forward signals will remain solidly positive.""And since vol-control funds are some of the dumbest money around and their actions can be anticipated well in advance, JPM notes that ""a further decline in volatility will likely result in larger and more stable cross-asset quant allocations. A larger momentum impact may affect Energy equities, which is the only sector that still has a strongly negative momentum signal and is hence heavily shorted in the context of factor investing.""That, JPMorgan believes, will ""change in mid-March, when the momentum signal for energy equities turns positive"" which may be a hint to the redditors out there: if you want to squeeze the systematic shorts, do it where it hurts and buy some energy stocks to crush the CTAs. You have about a month to do so because JPM's model momentum factor ""will need to rebalance in March by closing ~20% of its allocation to Energy equity shorts, and adding ~2% to energy longs, for a ~22% net buying in Energy.""What is the quantitative significance of these flows? Kolanovic calculates that if one roughly assumes that there is about ~$1Tr in equity long-short quant funds and that half of these funds are not sector neutralized, ""the flows could be quite significant, roughly $20-$30bn."" As shown in the chart below, the ratio of energy shares shorted vs all other S&P 500 shares shorted, closely followed the commodity supercycle.Remarkably, most recently the number of shares shorted for energy was 4 times the S&P 500 average (note that given the decline of the sector’s weight, energy share prices declined, and the effective $ amount shorted was only 2 times larger). In other words, one doesn't even need to squeeze the shorts: come March - absent some major new crisis - as a result of broader market technicals the prevailing shorts will close them out on their own and go long.Another ""flow factor"" behind the ""supercycle"" is rotation by discretionary funds and retail: In the period from 2010 to 2015, the Energy sector had a 10.6% allocation in conventional equity portfolios. Since then, this has declined to a 3.1% weight currently (Figure 4). The largest decline was in active allocations, which declined from 7% to 1.5% (while passive allocations decreased from 3.6% to 1.8%), which is understandable - investors dumped ""dead stocks"" to chase growth and momentum, but the tide is now turning, and ""any retracement of this decline, on a US equity fund asset base of ~$14T would result in significant inflows and re-pricing.""According to Kolanovic, as economies reopen, inflation moves higher, and yield curves steepen, active funds are expected to first close cyclical shorts, and then rotate from long secular growth towards value and cyclicals. His next point is critical: given that equity assets significantly increased over the last 10 years, and the energy sector significantly decreased, even a small rotation could produce an outsized move.",0.9839

I'm simply saying the narrative is not the same as it was when OIL was $68. Now, get India past this ugly and sad state of affairs, and OIL will quickly, very quickly rise. But, alas, I don't see C19 settling down by earnings. Therefore I don't see the monster move back to the $40's and $50's any time soon. But, reality is such that, earnings is King. And $60 oil is going to produce $2 billion+. So, IMO, my PT is $28-$30 at earnings and all is predicated on the C19 narrative. If it gets suppressed this summer, then we see $40 by end of summer imo. Now, for my crazy prognostication.Get the C19 behind us and the World Economy is unrestricted? Its $80 oil by end of year and possibly $100+ by end of year. OXY will be pumping 100mboe/quarter and a $100/barrel price? Now we are talking $60 in earnings per barrel minimum. Or better yet, $6billion per quarter.

2304,"A note from RBC saying that competing bids for APC are unlikely...03:06 PM EDT, 04/15/2019 (MT Newswires) -- Anadarko Petroleum (APC) is unlikely to receive any competing bids after Chevron's (CVX) takeover offer made last week, and shareholders will probably approve the $65-a-share deal, RBC Capital Markets said in a note on Monday.The bank's analysts, Scott Hanold and Brad Heffern, opted to lower their rating on Anadarko to sector perform from outperform, and cut their price target to be in line with the takeoever bid of $65, from a target of $74 previously.Chevron made the overture to The Woodlands, Texas-based Anadarko, offering shareholders 0.3869 of a Chevron share and $16.25 in cash for each Anadarko share, implying a transaction structure of 75% stock and 25% cash, RBC said. On Monday, CNBC reported that Occidental Petroleum (OXY) had been making a play with in an offer that reached the mid-$70s per share, with 40% in cash.""We think that APC ultimately chose CVX for its synergies, structure with its balance sheet, and potential longer-term benefits to its shareholders,"" Hanold and Heffern said. ""The offer from OXY is reported to have required shareholder approval, whereas CVX's required only board of directors approval. We do not anticipate any additional competing offers.""The transaction implies a $61-a-barrel price for West Texas Intermediate, ""consistent with the three-year oil price strip, and provides reasonable value for APC shareholders given current market conditions.""RBC said the broader US exploration and production sector has lagged oil prices this year, and that's starting to be noticed by investors. ""The acquisition appears to indicate that the industry has noticed the implicit value in many of the US E&Ps,"" the analysts said.Anadarko's shares have fallen behind peers even more over the past year amid concerns over changes in Colorado that could affect the DJ Basin, which the company calls a key focus area, as well as costs for its liquefied natural gas plant in Mozambique.""We expect the peer group to appreciate favorably with higher oil prices but APC upside is limited given the acquisition offer by CVX,"" RBC said.Price: 62.27, Change: +0.49, Percent Change: +0.79http://www.mtnewswires.com Copyright  2019 MT Newswires.

2307,"Yup! From today:""The company's market cap is under $20 billion, but its enterprise value is more than $67 billion. Investors who didn't mind betting on a leveraged oil stock were rewarded handsomely as OXY shares more than doubled since the end of September. Multiple insiders purchases OXY shares earlier this year, some of whom paid as much as $33 for these shares. If the demand for oil and oil prices continue to recover, OXY shares could double again and still be cheaper than it was 12 months ago.""",0.9761
2308,"At oil's current pricing of $42+ and OXY's current break even at roughly $25, there is a $17/barrel profit built in currently. At 1.3 million barrels/day thats $22.1 million/day in profit. Or $663 million per month. Or $7.956 billion in profit/yr. This is what B of A is referencing. Of course, no Capex must be implemented and pricing must continue to be stable and firming. Next weeks CC is going to be quite telling. Of course its going to be bad. But, the divvy is all but gone now and Capex has dropped off a cliff. Salaries have been squeezed. I would be shocked like everyone else if OXY beat in a large way. Cant see it happening. But, I can see $42 being much higher than -$37. Oil has been in the tank until June. Only then was it 'profitable'. Another thing, oil isnt going down in the toilet this time around. Production is way too low. Its about 25% of a year ago. SA has slowed shipping. Production has finally come down to consumption. I mentioned that these numbers would pass in the night some weeks ago. We are here. The pain hasn't been realized because inventory is still remarkably high. But, the draw down is going to pick up steam over the next 4-6 weeks. By the time Mr. Market becomes comfortable with inventory, IMO it will corollate with timing of election, it will be too late. Overall production will have dropped to well below consumption, and inventory will be low enough to cause concern. Then the Capex destruction now being implemented across the board will rear its ugly head. Oil will embark on a powerful Bull run. The pain will be next summer. USA will be importing oil to keep up. Oil at $60 by year end and $70/$80 by summer 2021.If OXY escapes BK, they already have IMO, then this scenario creates a path to reinstituting divvy in 12 months. Lose $6 billion in assets=$30 billion in debt. Pay down $5 billion=$25 billion in debt. 8% bond payments is $2 billion. This leaves $5 billion for Capex and divvy. $1 divvy, $2.5 for Capex, and that leaves $1.5 billion or so to pad the bank account. Thats all at $42/barrel. Add another $1 million+/day per $1 of oil or $365 million+/year. Dont know the production reduction on sold assets, so just referencing 1 million barrels/day. Get oil to $50 by year end and you add another $3 billion in FCF. Now the assets become full priced, and the debt rating becomes extremely favorable. $25/barrel breakeven. $50 oil. $25/barrel profit. 1.1 million barrel+ per day. $10 Billion + in FCF. The potential is staggering if Vicki can withhold the divvy payments and retain assets as much as possible. Wade through this storm and the payout will be staggering.",-0.8326

So let me understand the week: Earnings are announced the stock pops to almost $45 but drops after they talk about a cut in CAPEX leading to a cut in production for the purpose of saving the dividend. So the stock drops to around $42. Now the threat of a dividend cut sends it to $38.50 intraday.

OXY management couldn't put a package together on their own and are resorting to have employees identify the number of months base salary they're willing to except for voluntary separation!(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp is offering its employees voluntary buyouts over the next two weeks, according to a document seen by Reuters on Tuesday, citing the sharp decline in oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic for ""severe dislocations"" in its business.Occidental bet heavily on the continued growth in U.S. shale oil, taking on heavy debts for its controversial purchase of Anadarko Petroleum last year for $38 billion. That bet has proved ill-timed following the coronavirus outbreak, which has cut fuel demand worldwide by about 30% and is responsible for the worst oil-and-gas-industry downturn in 40 years.Energy companies worldwide, including Exxon Mobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell PLC , have slashed capital expenditures and oil output to reckon with the pandemic.Houston-based Occidental last week posted a $2 billion quarterly loss and has slashed capital spending drastically to shore up its balance sheet. The company said that if spending cuts are not met, it will have ""serious potential consequences"" to the company, the document said.Interested employees can submit a resignation offer to Occidental through May 26, specifying the number of months of base salary that they will accept for voluntary separation, according to the document. Employees can amend or withdraw offers unless the company has already accepted them by then, the document said.

Within the coming weeks we are going to see the fruits of these decisions. Either another massive spike in deaths, not cases, is going to occur and set us back or this may very well be the end of the hysteria and time for life to return with an acceptance of COVID is a virus no different than others. I read the CDC's now released data showing that only 6% of all the reported COVID deaths in America were solely the cause of the virus. Again not giving a political take nor do I need one in return. I offer this observation as a way of saying, if life is returning to normal, we may be a very short time from sector rebound.

However, OXY may follow the same approach as RDS did, which is to maximize the impairment charges to get tax refunds to enhance the cash position. Impairment charges are non-cash expenditures anyway so this should be excluded in the analysis. Plus, everyone expects the report to be ""bad"". So, it is better to recognize a monstrous impairment charges, and later recover the EPS expectation when assets are being sold once oil price improves significantly with huge gains.

Melissa Schoeb, a spokeswoman for Occidental, declined to comment when contacted by e-mail.Oxy, as the US oil producer is known, is working with state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. to develop the Shah field, with production to begin at the end of the year.The UAE is tapping the reserve of sour gas, fuel with a high content of deadly sulfur dioxide, to meet domestic demand for the hydrocarbon used to run power plants and feed chemical facilities.Oxy, based in Houston, is trying to sell some Middle East assets individually after failing earlier this year to cut 40% of its operations in the region, people familiar with the situation said last month.A transaction on the Shah project could be completed by the end of this year, with Oxy retaining part of its 40% stake and continuing to operate the field, PIW reported. Adnoc would retain its 60% holding in the project in a deal that would mark Mubadala’s first domestic investment in oil or gas production, PIW said.Oxy is also seeking to sell part of its stake in Dolphin Energy, a venture that operates a pipeline transporting gas from Qatar to the UAE and Oman, PIW said.

Going forward oil supply will be constrained by government policies to encourage investment in green energy, however, due to global reliance on fossil fuels, oil demand is not projected to fall until 2055 - it will continue to grow at around 2% per year.

Its my POV that WB already has exposure to OXY and wants his dividend in cash and not shares. With an inflated payment through shares and Not cash by OXY, it only makes sense that WB would take advantage of the exchange and build cash. My reasoning is that WB knows that OXY is under pressure. Why buy shares now when you C19 hasn't run its course and thereby OXY has no certainty. Keep the cash. Build the cash. If you want to own OXY, there is plenty of opportunity to buy at a discount. Besides, WB is already exposed to OXY with an 8% dividend. Thats rich enough. Best to diversify in other oil companies as well. And he has.

2788,"Why I think oil will be $75-$80 by summer.When it comes to storage, We have been floating in the 400's for some time now. But, overall storage has been dropping. The pandemic is at its worst just this past month. Deaths and infections. This has caused the world govts. to revisit their safety protocols and tighten back up. Only now have the numbers shown substantial positive moves with infection and death rates. . Little Frac'ers have been going BK in droves. This has gotten the ire of the banks. Many an article has been written on the Banks unwillingness to loan in this industry any longer. This illicited a response from the Feds. Only this last week did a Fed judge step in and say the banks can lend or not to any industry they want. To be sure, Banks never said they would absolutely not loan. They just outlined stringent requirements that few could meet. Er go, lil' Frac'ers. . We have entered prespring and the economy is showing signs of opening up. Cruise Ships and the like. And with Summer travel being the heavy consumer it is every year, there is a pent up demand coming over the market. The tide has shifted. The Market is what moves futures and SP. Both have been on a tear. . Right now, production is basically in lock step with consumption. There is a glaring problem though. Consumption Can be turned on like a spigot, or better put, a drain. The hose filling the pool can be turned up but you have to travel 5 miles to turn it on. (2 months from SA to get a tanker). Domestic production has been substantially weekend by 20%+. Now let's reason on this for a sec. Is the U.S. The only country with a production problem? Uh, No. Many countries don't even produce oil. What happens when the World opens up but production has been destroyed? The bottle neck thats coming due to emerging countries desperately needing oil is going to create an extremely volatile market in the coming months IMO. This is why the pundits are projecting $80 oil by eoy and potentially $100 oil next year. For perspective, these same pundits back in May, were projecting $60 oil by summer 2021. I believe they were trying to be conservative and not put out the worst case scenario. $60 is here and its the first week of Feb. Just....think about that for a minute. If we are at $60, why is the market supporting this pricing? Imo, its simple. Its all about production/consumption ratio. The market sees a constricting bottle neck. So do I.Oil $75/$80 this summer. The real pain will be next year when Cruises and Airplanes will have gone back to a relative normal and all these Oil majors lack of Capex will come back to haunt the consumer. $100+ by 2022 summer. Yeah, I think I'm being conservative.Oil at $65 OXY at $28-$30Oil at $80 Oxy North of $45.Oxy divest noncore assets by eoy, fcf and return to a dividend and the SP will be north of $60 headed to $80. Its all about positive trajectory. $80 by eoy 2022. And a real path to $100+ if/when oil hits a sustained $100. That should put Warrants at $90-$100. The story will be too compelling Not to have this kind of run up. Remember as well, that OXY will Never be debt free. They just find their number and issue dividends off that balance sheet.",0.9949

Assurance: one of the four lowest cost producers, leader in carbon capture technology (which will important to meet the ""staying green"" goal), the pandemic has accelerated their cost cutting plan and the majority of that will become permanent, great connection with the bankers (chavez - a former banker, icahn, and buffet), a wide range of portfolio of assets, 400 mil shares are approved, dividend is (almost) completely cut.Risk: bankruptcy if there's another oil war. That risk is minimal now given the fact that both the Saudi and Russian were suffered greatly during the last oil war (you never know). Saudi's and Russia's economy is suffering greatly now because of a combination of both low oil revenue due to low price and covid-19. Given the fact that all countries had experienced with covid-19, they will be more prepared if the 2nd wave reappears. So overall, we have more assurances but we have one minimal risk (given the fact that the Saudi and Russian already experienced the oil war and didn't like it). I think our sliding scale is tilted towards the safety side. OXY may be a primed candidate for a takeover especially in this low interest rate environment. During the past week, we saw that OXY tripled its volume at a higher price, and the sell-off only had slightly above average daily volume.

Paulett Eberhartand R. A. WalkerMay 5, 2019Dear Members of the Anadarko Board of Directors:We are pleased to submit our revised proposal to acquire Anadarko for $76 per share, comprised of $59 in cash and 0.2934 shares of Occidental common stock per Anadarko share. Our Board of Directors has unanimously approved this proposal and we are enclosing the merger agreement, attaching disclosure schedules of Anadarko and Occidental, which we are prepared to sign, together with a copy of our equity commitment from Berkshire Hathaway and our debt commitment from BofA Merrill Lynch and Citi.Our revised proposal represents a premium of approximately 23.3% to the $61.62 per share value of Chevron’s offer as of Friday’s market close. The significantly increased cash component provides value and closing certainty and the equity component continues to provide your shareholders an opportunity to participate in the value creation of this exciting combination. Our revised proposal does not require an Occidental shareholder vote, which has been repeatedly cited as the explanation for why you previously chose Chevron’s $65 offer over our $76 offer.Anadarko announced on April 29 that the Board of Directors of Anadarko had determined that our April 24 proposal of $76 comprised of $38 in cash and 0.6094 shares of Occidental common stock per Anadarko share, could reasonably be expected to result in a “Superior Proposal” as defined in your agreement with Chevron. We hope that the Board of Directors of Anadarko will promptly declare our revised and significantly enhanced proposal a “Superior Proposal,” so that you can comply with your obligations under your existing merger agreement and expeditiously secure this compelling value for Anadarko shareholders.Our revised proposal and merger agreement represents our comprehensive response to all points that your counsel has raised with ours over the course of the past week. Your counsel communicated to ours on Thursday evening a request for three board seats on the Occidental board. We believe our revised proposal, which is 78% cash, does not support this and therefore we have not included such a provision. The $1 billion breakup fee that resulted from your decision to select a $65 merger rather than the $76 per share we offered three weeks ago, will be borne by Occidental once we acquire Anadarko.Our merger agreement does not contain any financing condition or, as noted above, any Occidental shareholder approval condition, and we do not anticipate any delay to completing the regulatory approval process. We would expect to be in a position to close a transaction in the second half of 2019. As you are aware, our financial advisors are BofA Merrill Lynch and Citi, and our legal advisors are Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, and we and they are available if you have any questions.We remain perplexed at your apparent resistance to obtaining far more value for Anadarko shareholders which has been expressed clearly through our interactions over the last week. As you know from our long-standing interest, we firmly believe that Occidental is uniquely positioned to create significant and sustainable growth and value from Anadarko’s asset portfolio. We hope we can execute this merger agreement without delay and proceed to bringing this exciting combination to fruition.Sincerely,Vicki HollubPresident and Chief Executive OfficerOccidental Petroleum Corporation",0.9991

Hopefully COVID vaccination and people's confidence in travel will be back in 2nd half of 2021. With the travel back on track, Oil demand and price will also be back to $50 at-least.Now the question should be if OXY can survive till 2021 end with lower oil price. As per the latest quarterly result and recent bond offers, OXY has already made sure that it has enough money ($1B cash in hand, $5 loan available, $2-$3 asset sale) to pay down the upcoming debt (around $10B) and CapEx till 2021 end. So there should be on concern on OXY bankruptcy by 2021 end. You can't control stock price as it fluctuate with people's sentiment. Once Oil is back to $50, all oil stocks will be back on track so don't worry about it. Actually take advantage of market and buy it at lower price, if you think Oil prices will be recovered by end of 2021 and OXY won't go bankrupt till then.

The U.S. and China along with parts of Europe are rebounding strongly from the pandemic as a vaccination drive accelerates. The prompt timespread for global benchmark Brent crude has also started widening again in a bullish backwardation structure, signaling a tightening market.Meanwhile, gasoline stations are in the process of returning to normal following the restart of Colonial Pipeline Co. after a cyberattack halted flows, although fuel disruptions may still be seen for weeks in parts of the U.S. East and South.Oil has managed to break out from a tight range near $60 a barrel and resume its upward momentum, but constant reminders that parts of the world remain far from a full recovery from the pandemic continues to dent the outlook. The coronavirus resurgence in India is still crippling industry, while new outbreaks in Singapore and Taiwan show authorities need to remain vigilant.Another wildcard is the prospect of more crude flows from Iran as the nation seeks to revive a nuclear deal and free itself of U.S. sanctions, but talks are ongoing and progress on a solution remains uncertainThe prompt timespread for Brent was 34 cents in backwardation -- where near-dated contracts are more expensive than later-dated ones -- compared with 23 cents a week earlier.

3051,"Occidental Petroleum (OXY)OXY is my highly speculative high risk high reward play. OXY has gotten crushed. It’s down nearly 70% in just the last month. The stock has fallen along with oil. The problem with oil is twofold with issues on both the supply and demand side.First, the economy basically being shut down from the coronavirus outbreak has caused a major demand shock. Second, the Saudi’s spat with the Russians has caused a major supply glut. On top of all this, OXY was placed in a bad position with a recent buy of Anadarko leaving them burdened with a heavy debt load. Moody’s actually just downgraded their debt.So you must be wondering why in the world I would buy it now when it seems the company is facing the most pessimistic outlook in years and trading at a 17 year low. Well, actually that’s the exact reason why I bought it. It’s a contrarian call.Starting as position at the point of maximum pessimism is one of the hardest things to do. A contrarian believes that certain crowd behavior among investors can lead to exploitable mispricings in stocks. Widespread pessimism about a stock can drive a price so low that it overstates the company's risks, and understates its prospects for returning to profitability. Selling high and buying low is one of the hardest things to do. It is counter intuitive to human nature. This is why most don’t stand a chance of beating the market. You must buy when they cry and sell when they yell as a contrarian investor. Now, you must have a thesis for the stock to recover and courage in your convictions to stay the course. Nonetheless, fortune favors the bold. The following is my bull thesis regarding OXY.First, I believe the Saudis will come to an agreement with Russia sooner rather than later. One little peep of a deal with Russia and I see oil skyrocketing higher. In fact, oil was up substantially as of the time of this writing. The Saudis are famous for walking back their threats. Furthermore, they need $75 barrel to pay for all their social programs. So it may only cost them $10 a barrel, yet they need $75 a barrel to sustain their way of life. So they are really in a worse position than the US shale players. I don’t see this lasting very long.Second, I do not see the current situation with the coronavirus outbreak lasting as long as many are currently predicting. China has gotten it under control in 2 months. I see demand coming back sooner rather than later. Lastly, OXY has cut the dividend and has excellent assets under management. Plus, Warren Buffet and Carl Icahn are large shareholders. They tend to know a good deal when they see it. I feel I am in good company.As I said before, layer into any position in small increments as more volatility lies ahead. I like to say its “time in” the market not “timing” the market that generates profitable investments and creates long-term wealth. My 12 month price target is $22 providing over 100% upside.

Where OXY's debt has grown almost 5X since 2016 to around 46 Billion ( oil was hovering around 30 at press time ) and that OXY looks to be heading for restructuring or even BK. I know oil has moved up since this article was written and I think that should help OXY but this was Forbes thinking at that time . OXY also has the ability to issue those 400 million new shares which will give them a little more breathing room. If OXY can move up a little more I will be positive in my shares and will definitely put in some stop loss instructions in to make sure I keep any profit . OXY can easily fall 5.00 as it jumped and if they do issue those share it will ( if they issue them when OXY is over 20 then it should stay over 10.00 a share to help trading rules for some companies ) or if oil production jumps in the US or elsewhere.

Her timing to buy Anadarko at the price she paid in my opinion was made in hast. This company stock would be down with the others but not as much as it is down today. Remember its has been down ever since the purchase was made. If the shareholders had a say in the purchase the shareholders would be responsible for the current price. I didn't get a chance to hear the conference call so if anyone could share what the positive things Vicki had to say I would greatly appreciate it. I do not know if she was asked the question what funds are being used to pay off debt associated with the Anadarko acquisition. And whats up with the charge of approximately $1.0 billion to reflect Occidental’s investment in Western Midstream Partners and the 10 billion in deferred income tax liability.

Quote - Biden and Energy StocksEquity ResearchWells Fargo SecuritiesSept. 1: Donald Trump’s re-election would keep the conventional oil-and-gas industry in a favorable political environment, in our view. By contrast, a Joe Biden victory would place the oil-and-gas industry in the opposite position, in our opinion. We base these conclusions on the statements and actions of the first Trump administration, as well as the public statements, party platforms, and policy proposals of both candidates for 2020, and our analysis.More so than in past elections, the immediate and longer-term prospects for the oil-and-gas industry appear quite dependent upon the outcome of the 2020 election. The stated policies of a first-term Biden administration would likely undercut prospects for oil-and-gas growth and investment and potentially shorten the useful lives of existing assets. The refining and natural-gas/electric-power sectors are specifically highlighted within the Biden campaign’s policy proposals for decarbonization and emissions reductions. In front of the election, we believe that companies with diversified operations, significant international exposure, and less exposure to undeveloped federal lands/offshore will be less risky choices.Thus, in the pre-election interim, we favor [companies] such as Overweight-rated Chevron (ticker: CVX) and BP (BP). While we remain favorably disposed toward several refiners, the potential for a Biden victory is likely enough to keep most investors on the sidelines, at least until the election results are known. We would be very careful investing in highly leveraged oil and gas companies like Underweight-rated Occidental Petroleum (OXY) or Overweight-rated Calumet Specialty Products Partners (CLMT) in advance of the election, given the divergent outcomes.—Roger D.

Another way to think of it is, your buying shares with 4 to 1 margin, one part share price, 3 parts debt. Now you see why you need to be really careful at what you pay. If OXY is a 40 billion dollar or less company, the shares are worthless. If OXY is an 80 billion dollar company, the shares are worth, $40 each. If crude stays at these levels for 10 years, OXY is a zombie just paying the interest on the debt, If crude stays at or below 36, OXY will eventually file bankruptcy. Now factor in all the effort to electrify driving and go solar and wind and you better understand the risk. Now if OPEC dosn't cheat on quotas and nonOPEC doesn't start poking holes in the ground in places that are still profitable, and crude stays here until the economy fully opens and assuming the economy isn't in a depression at that time, oil could rally to some high price that makes the risk worth it.

In my honest opinion, we should already be in the $50-$60 range with these oil prices, perhaps it'll be priced in closer to our next earnings report. On top of this, consider the fact that OPEC just edited their outlook for 2021 oil demand, stating it is projected to be HIGHER in mbpd comparatively to previous reports, though they lowered short term targets due to Europe shutting down again. To me, this signals we're going to break out to new highs in the $75 WTI range on the same news that's been crashing us -- you heard it here first, headlines will read 'Oil bullish on European reopening,' as OPEC and Sauds also have it all in their best interest to hike up oil prices since American energy independence is a thing of the past.

My new estimate is that OXY will report a loss of $1.22 which is much better than the analysts concensus estimate of -$1.67. I think that if I am correct in my EPS estimate OXY could rise to $21.00. I also think that if the reported loss is smaller than -$1.12 the stock will rise to $24.00. Just my opinion. Do your own research.",0.9303

3334,"How to Sell or Exercise a WarrantA warrant holder may choose to exercise the warrant if the current stock price is above the strike price of the warrant. Alternatively, the warrant holder could sell their warrants, as warrants can be traded similar to options.If the current stock price is below the strike price, it makes little sense to exercise the option, since it is cheaper to buy the stock on the stock market. For example, if the strike of the warrant is $40, and the stock is currently trading at $30, it is not prudent to exercise the right to buy the stock at $40 when it can be purchased at $30. On the other hand, if the stock is trading at $50, and the strike of the warrant is $40, it is beneficial to exercise the warrant. That said, just because the current stock price is above the strike price doesn't mean the warrant has to be exercised. If there is still lots of time until the warrant expires, holding onto the warrants may prove even more profitable.For example, if over the next year the stock rises to $80, the warrant has become more valuable. The stock is trading at $80 and the warrant holder has the right to buy at $40 (and could immediately sell those shares for $80).",0.9756

Tells me that the wells coming back on line is a total head fake till we see $45. Every single month we see oil at $40/$41 is causing a steady tightening grip on future production. All these guys that have been laid off are waiting to return to work. Some cant wait that long. The Reality is that once the market returns to $45, the pool of qualified workers will have shrunk. For context, OXY has stated they aren't capex'ing for increased production, they are focusing on existing wells. That only lasts for so long before you have to drill to maintain production. OXY is allowing their production to drift down to 1.2million and than going to hold steady. As I've said all along, the real pain is next spring for production. The reality of all these shut ins and stoppages will come to fruition in approximately 6/9 months. By then, the little Frackers will be BK'd and M&A'd out of existence. The rise will be steady by that point.I called for $60 oil by EOY. I was wrong. Revisit of C19 and the airlines stubborn resistance to returning pre Covid flight norms has gutted my outlook. To me, we have a 'vaccine' limited recovery. Get the vaccine, then the return of the world economy will be back on track.

We have put in place, as the slide deck shows, Slide 20,natural gas hedges for 530 million standard cubic per day as of 12.31 with a value between 2.50 and 3.64 on a costless basis, similar to acost of basis we had on the hedge oil last year. There's no extending call option though on the gas side.We continue to evaluate additional hedges, particularly on the oil side on a regular basis. We evaluate the cost of doing so versus notdoing so. As you can imagine, doing a pure put is still fairly expensive despite the improvement in price. And a costless type collar hedgeis going to require both the cap in the current year in addition to the one we have hanging over us today last year's hedge, extending oneinto 2022.And so we look at the -- we moved the debt maturities down quite a bit in the near term, which is somewhat of a hedge againstdownturns in the business in the near term. We also know that shareholders appreciate our heavy exposure, leverage to oil price. And sowe have not put something in place as of now, but we're going to continue to evaluate them and see if they're going to be constructive inthe future",0.8997

3533,"I am an oil/gas guy who thinks BP and ExxonMobil are good for the long haul. That said, the recent runup was nice but unsustainable once the world's bad actors with oil to sell are caught doing what they do. The integrated companies will always be okay. It is poorly funded, heavily indebted companies like OXY that have a real problem. The irrational move from 8+ to over 31 is an easy one to take advantage of. On Tuesday after the meager 4 cent dividend is earned, I will short big time. And to help it along will be the 1.9 billion democrat stimulus bill which will help many companies but not OXY which has already risen because of the higher oil prices and expectations of the stimulus as well as the opening up of the US market. Going back under $20 within a month is my expectation.",0.9155

This has sent a shock waves of Jitters in SA & 2 days back the Saudi King spoke to President Trump. Further SA got the message loud & clear & that was the reason that they agreed to a further cut of 1 million barrels per day effective 1st June 2020. Hence I am optimistic that soon Supply Demand balance will improve & Oil prices may recover. I am no expert, but it is my 2 cents on the whole issue.

3539,I think that regardless of the fundamentals OXY will have a hard time getting its share price to where it should rightfully be until after it shows its Q2 results are decidedly better than what analysts predicted; it has raised a significant amount of money from the sale of unwanted assets; and the price of a barrel of oil stabilizes around the $42-$45 per barrel area. At that point I think you would finally see capitulation by the naysayers (Motley Fool and others) and energy stocks will experience a significant rebound with OXY rebounding more than the rest of the group. How long can the wait be? In my opinion one or two quarters.,0.9722

OXY could package up groups of the assets they want to sell into a couple or more NEWLY formed Corporations , pass over reasonable amounts of their debt to get it off OXY books - then take the new company(s) public to raise $$$ . Perhaps they could do this with African operations and then also with GOM assets creating new wholly owned operating co’s that could then go public giving all the proceeds to OXY for debt reduction.

I meant more. 4. Hopefully Oxy can take the unsolicited offer and complete the 2-3 billion divesture they aimed to achieve by the summer time. I think the deal was well underway otherwise they may not have given a specific time frame back in Feb. They say covid variant cases are rising in Asia, but I only see 8 countries that are actually up on weekly basis out of 48 countries. I am worried about Thailand, Argentina, South Africa, Portugal, but.. still I mean the world's cases are down 15% on weekly basis, so I think the good news offset the bad news. 5. Approximately 25 to 30 million vaccination per day in the world. That's another 1.5 billion dose until July 19th. That should be more than enough for North America, EU, and maybe some Asian / South American countries. 6. Based on Israel data. I think we see high level of herd immunity with 25% of adults fully vaccinated. The age population of 40 years and above. I think partly the reason is because under the age of 40, the mortality rate is just extremely low that nobody gets hospitalized or checked out. 7.

3578,the probably of chev just taking the 1B and leaving is slim to none... they came to play... they have already been talking up how good this deal would be for them... predicting they could get a barrel out of the ground at $15... in a find that is Saudi sized. plus their stock currency is up at a point where its a good time to be used for a purchase. It would take nothing for chev to match oxy or top them by a few $ and walk with darko. chev already has the favorable blessings of darko. As for the notion that chev would attempt a double purchase of both oxy and darko in one swoop. (nice thought but don't see that happening) And if by chance oxy does for some reason get darko.. people here seem to think they will crater and fall into the ocean... so the stock price would go down (temporarily) doesn't mean it will stay down there forever. if I have an ounce of gold that is $1200 (fully paid for) and I borrow $1200 to buy another one... now I have leveraged myself.... doesn't mean I have still have only 1 piece of gold and a new debt... I have the debt.. but I have the 2 pieces of gold .... meaning.. yeah they will take on the debt..but they have all the new assets added to the pile.. imagine they kept the oxy name and just made darko a division under the parent company.. still ran as 2 companies.. under one name.. they are still both self sufficient without doing a thing. that would be considered ok.. Or if this wasnt hostile.. and the two came out and said they were planning a merger.. that would have been ok... so whats the big punishment for taking one over and cost cutting and instituting synergies..? everyone has lost sight of the simple process and the real underlying pros of the deal... as for the share price... just sit tight unless you are perched on margin.. which if you are.. and sitting with a loss.. then that has nothing to do with oxy in the first place.. its you who got yourself in the pickle. either pay off your margin... or cost average if you believe in the long term prospects of the stock. remember.. stocks go UP.. and DOWN... you knew that when you bought it.. but if you bought in the 70's and 80's and you don't need the money.. stick around.. you should be able to get back most or all of your money in the (long term) no matter who is the victor. one rule in stock that most people don't tell.. panic usually causes losses.. just remember.. oxy is already one of the largest players in the permian... it can remain the same size or get larger.. either way.. its a winner.. you just have to stick out the race.. whats your downside? any drop in price from here is not going to be forever. limited downside.. the upside is limitless (with time) as for this board... all we can do is guess at the future...

At this point you have a choice to make. Either allow them to run OUR company in this fashion or vote them out. These CEO's and boards are all getting a bit out of control everywhere.

Oxy is the largest producer in the Permian and DJ basins, and a top producer in the Gulf of Mexico. The ability to deploy OXY's technological, subsurface and operational expertise to Anadarko's holdings (particularly in the Permian) is expected to create significant value in a more normalized oil price environment by lowering unit costs.""https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-rates-oxy-senior-unsecured-bonds-bb-12-08-2020""",0.2612

3705,"OXY is at idle, which is good for us. Buy all you can now before is jumps to $45-$50 this summer. Because of the lower demand for oil and the slower economy in general, a lot of companies, including OXY cut their dividend or stopped paying their dividend completely. It is to the discretion of the company to reinstate it. Why should OXY start paying? OXY can afford to pay a portion of the dividend, $0.10 or $0.15. But I say no, don't pay it. Keep the dividend in OXY's pocket and pay down their debt. OXY is $38.5 billion in debt. The good news is OXY is saving $3 billion a year by not paying the dividend.( 933 million outstanding shares times $3.16 a share per year). I think the company is holding off on the dividend and putting the money toward its debt. This will only make OXY even stronger. The dividend will resume next year or slowly transition up in $0.10 increments. So my advice to you is buy now at $26.

3732,"I've postulated before and I'll do so again, oil could trade around 30 for a decade and this wouldn't be historically abnormal. I come to this number because in the 80's and 90's it was glued to 18 bucks making 18 some kind of floor that producers just can't pump below without shutting down operations. Adjust 18 for inflation and you arrive at around 30 today. Having said that, I'm fully aware that there is a slim chance OPEC and shale drillers arrive at a Mexican standoff and both continue to hold back production. This is unlikely as history has shown a propensity to cheat. The best case for oil is severe backwardation in the futures market. If front month is trading much higher than back months, nobody will drill wells but those with production will keep making money selling at market. Right now oil futures are in strong forwardation indication to many bulls are assuming things will go higher in the future. This gives the ability to drill some wells and get financing by selling those distant futures and locking in a profit. So my advice to those dying to go long oil stocks, watch for backwardation.",0.9711

3743,"I live here on the west coast and talked with a neighbor who works in the RV business. He said sales records are being broken for buying travel trailers and the like. I asked whats that all about? It was his opinion that people are refinancing their homes at incredibly low interest rates and using ghe funds to spend time during layoffs among the C19 pandemic. Made sense to me as people are furloughed AND getting federal unemployment as well. Getting paid more to sit at home than to go to work. This brings me to my next point/example; another friend of mine works at COST. He said corporate is allowing workers to be furloughed if they feel threatened by C19. He does as he's mid 50's with underlying health issues. The state gave him unemployment and the Feds gave him unemployment. The result? He makes ~50% more in benefits than working. Why am I bringing up these 2 examples? There is an underlying story to the economic impact we are experiencing and about to experience. The first is that a lot of 1 time purchasing has been taking place with extremely low interest rates..2008/9 anyone? The 2nd is that once these furloughed people come back to work, or not, the rubber is going to meet the road. Either well paying jobs get eliminated due to efficiency, or the workers that replaced the furloughed people will get displaced. Either way, a reality is coming and soon. Im still left wondering, what is the value of the dollar going to be in the coming months/years? Just seems like a ton of pressure keeps building. In turn, OIL is going to reciprocate that pressure. In summation, inflation is coming. Maybe not throw money out ghe window kind of inflation, but gasoline isnt going to stay this low. Neither is milk, eggs and a loaf of bread.",0.5547

With 7 years of expiry, and the fact the oil usage is within 10% of pre-covid level, and oil prices slowly inching up, at some point, OXY may get to the lowest price it had before Covid, which is $37. At that point, just the intrinsic value of the warrant will be $37-22 = $15, five times current value. It will be a huge coupe when it happens. The only argument I had against huge investment in OXY warrant was the risk of bankruptcy. Based on current oil prices, no near-term debt due, and likelihood of positive cash flow in Q3, I don't think bankruptcy is even on horizon for a couple of year if oil doesn't go negative again. I have long investment horizon of several years and can easily wait it out for few years. If OXY goes above $40 within next 5-6 years, OXY warrants will fund most of my retirement.

This lagging factor as the current economy recovery concern could DELAY the FED to act at a reasonable time for it to increase the interest rate. Good fact about this that this will allow the oil price to increase to an unthinkable price. By that time, this oil price will IMPACT the inflation significantly, and will result the Fed with no mercy to increase the interest rates to control the inflation.

That contest is expected to drag on into the fall.Anadarko shareholders are expected next week to approve a deal that provides a 57% premium to its share price the day before it disclosed acquisition talks.Hollub said the company would not make a decision on the fate of Anadarko’s stake in Western Midstream Partners until after the closing.",0.8398

3868,"Most analysts have made up their minds about oil prices.There is a growing consensus that Brent crude, the global benchmark, is likely to average at least $60 a barrel for the foreseeable future, and companies will finally earn profits that have eluded them for years. But some of this bounty has already been baked into the stocks, and Bank of America analyst Doug Leggate thinks it is time to pull back on certain names.On Monday, the recent oil rally took a pause: Brent futures were down 1.4%, to $68.23 a barrel, and West Texas Intermediate futures were down 1.5%, to $64.62 a barrel.Bank of America thinks $60 oil is here to stay, because OPEC is ready to defend that price with aggressive production cuts, and shale producers in the U.S. have also curbed production. Last year, when oil traded in the $20s and $30s for much of the year, a $60 baseline price seemed unthinkable.The oil surge is obviously bullish for oil companies, and the bank increased its price targets on oil stocks by an average of 17%. Still, some of those stocks have already run up so much that they no longer look like bargains. The SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production exchange-traded fund (ticker: XOP) is already up 53% this year.Leggate lowered his ratings on ConocoPhillips (COP), EOG Resources (EOG), Cimarex Energy (XEC), and Continental Resources (CLR) to Neutral “despite free cash yields that support greater return of cash to shareholders, but where the value of unlevered free cash flow net of debt suggests upside is more limited versus the broader sector.” In short, he sees better opportunities elsewhere. Continental, for instance, is already up 75% this year.His top ideas are Exxon Mobil (XOM), because of its strong dividend yield (now 5.8%); Hess (HES) and APA (APA) for their oil exploration potential; and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Devon Energy (DVN), after those companies have bought other shale producers at market lows.His top U.S. pick is Occidental Petroleum (OXY), which fought through a particularly difficult 2020 after loading up on debt to buy competitor Anadarko Petroleum. His price target for Occidental is $40. The stock was down 6% on Monday to $28.80.",0.9912

3877,"Jul. 19--Activist investor Carl Icahn revealed Thursday the four people he wants to appoint to the board of Occidental Petroleum(OXY) as part of his proxy war with the Houston oil and gas producer.Icahn named former Shell Oil President John Hofmeister and three of Icahn's close business allies as his four selections in his bid to replace nearly half of the Oxy board, according to a new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Last month, Icahn, who has built a nearly 5 percent ownership stake in Oxy, started the process to call for a special meeting. He's waging the proxy war because of his opposition to Oxy's pending $38 billion acquisition to The Woodlands-based Anadarko Petroleum(APC).In a multi-step process, Icahn first needs the support of holders of 20 percent of Oxy's stock to set a record date to determine which shareholders can petition to hold a special meeting.Apart from Hofmeister, Icahn's other potential nominees are Icahn Capital portfolio manager Nicholas Graziano, Icahn Enterprises(IEP) general counsel Andrew Langham, and Alan LeFevre, who was previously named to a board seat at Herbalife after Icahn won a proxy bid there.LeFevre is a former chief financial officer at the consumer products company Jarden Corp., which was acquired by Newell Brands(NWL) -- another company where Icahn controls board seats.The four board members that Icahn is seeking to remove are Oxy Chairman Eugene Batchelder, a retired ConocoPhillips(COP) executive; Spencer Abraham, head of The Abraham Group consulting firm; Margaret Foran, a Prudential Financial(PRU) senior executive; and Avedick Poladian, a former real estate executive at Lowe Enterprises.Oxy has told its shareholders that Icahn's efforts ""are not in the best interests of Occidental or its stockholders,"" and that the focus must be on completing the Anadarko acquisition.Oxy told shareholders if they had already agreed to back Icahn's special board meeting that they could still revoke their support.",0.9895

If the stock was trading 15-20 dollars higher when oil was lower???? in addition they bought another great company...would you guess that synergies alone could account for a massive addition to Eps....The permean production is massive..just read latest reports on the amount of nat gas and oil there..even mobil doubled their holdings...now OXy is the largest holder sitting on gold. AS SOON AS THE CEO LAYS ABOUT A CLEAR PLAN AND THE EPS POTENTIAL THIS WILL SHOOT BACk to the 60s and higher . I would imagine that it will not be a long wait they may must have all their largest holders..far more than Icahn infuriated by the drop from the high sixties to 40. I would guess that many will increase holdings jan 2 and on from there and the CEO will lay out her plan of how OXy will earn far more because of the deal....this is going to be good,0.9904

So, considering the two together, we think OXY can maintain the dividend with a flattish production profile at $50/barrel. There are lots of moving parts to this number, and OXY's own realized prices net of transportation costs can fluctuate a lot. The company did emphasize its commitment to the dividend in the second quarter conference.""""ConclusionWe think oil will average over $60/barrel and that will be the minimum required to balance supply and demand. As such, we think OXY is a strong buy at current prices and is worth at least $60/share. While the stock may ultimately move even higher, Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.B) preferred stake which was done as part of the financing for the APC deal came with call options on OXY stock at $62.50/share. Those are highly dilutive, and they will likely cap upside on moderate oil price moves. At the same time, we are certain that the shrewd investor who goes by the name Warren Buffett would have not asked for these if he did not see the oil cycle turning after years of battering for the E&P names. We would buy OXY for the dividend, half now and half into year end, and enjoy the delicious 7.5% yield.""",0.9873

As the analyst himself pointed out, it's just a matter of timing. Q2 will most likely see reversal of working capital, adding to cash on hand. Also, there is no super urgency to reduce debt and there very little debt due for another two years.

You've got only 4 billion dollar which is like due starting from year 2022 (a single asset sale + current cash + future fcf likely more than enough to handle this) then you get a huge break in 2023 with debt obligation. So.. the company is good until 2024. Now.. their fcf reported in the 3rd quarter with average wti 40.18 was 500 million dollars and this is conservative value. Bear in mind that we had low production due to covid 19. Now WTI is at 48.00 and I would like to remind you that the U.S. dollar is weakening and the majority of oil baskets in the world including OPEC are now higher than 50. If the u.s dollar weakens, the U.S. will likely export oil, not import oil because they have to pay more. We saw this back in 2009. Oxy's FCF grows by 200million dollars per $1 increase in WTI AT CURRENT PRODUCTION. This means with WTI standing 48, Oxy will be making 1.6 billion dollars more per year with current WTI price after making all interest payment, buffett payment, operating expense etc. This increase further if they produce more oil next year. I get pe ratio of 5 using their FCF with their stock price 19.18. I mean at some point you just know it is god darn cheap. They purchased Anardarko for 40 billion dollars.

4066,"Here’s what you need to do with your profits from $AMC and $GME. The market has taken on the false narrative that a virus caused the entire world’s infrastructure to change overnight to all solar and wind. This is simply a false narrative. There’s no doubt that the industrialized world will transition to green energy, but this will take a coordinated effort for the next 15 years.What do we do in the meantime? We change government policies to discourage oil and gas production. Part of this is to limit supply to drive up the price of gasoline and diesel fuel. This makes green alternative energy more tenable because it is cheap relative to oil and gas.In the US, the easy policies of the old administration actually hurt the oil and gas industry. They drilled and drilled until the US became the world leading exporter of oil and gas. Then COVID happened and world wide demand dropped by 8% - that’s right only 8%.So far in 2021, demand has recovered by 5%. As of right now, we are only using 3% less oil and gas than we were. Does that sound like a dead industry? Absolutely not.The meteoric stock price rise of solar companies and $TSLA is a bubble. The profits are not there.Now with oil at $53 and Nat Gas at $2.85 - oil companies are profitable.With oil and gas supply being limited by policy - we can expect oil to be $75 by 2022 and over $100 by 2023 - 2035. This is the last golden age of black gold. The last bull market of oil before the oil majors buyout the green energy companies with the treasure troves of cash they are going to generate over the next 15 years.So...take your profits and buy $OXY $XLE $XOM $CVX $ET & $GEL.

Here's the bad news:...a. USA has ALREADY sanctioned BOTH Iran and Venezuela to REDUCE the number of OIL barrels available in the market...b. USA, Brazil, and Norway are INCREASING the number of OIL barrels available in the market5. So, without agreeing to CUT more oil barrels, OPEC will FAIL to control how many OIL barrels are available in the market6.

No one can say #$%$ because it was Saudi who increased the price of oil by 30% with its surprise additional cut. The funny thing is that they made more money by the price increase even though it is producing less oil.

Right now at .2934 shares of oxy plus $59, the deal is set at $74.12 per APC share for those who believe OXY will trade at 52 or so when the deal is done. Besides the outstanding, OXY will have an overhang of the 80million shares from the warrants at 62.50 plus the $8 billion in preferred paying 8% per annum. Said another way, they will owe about 16B in assumed debt or about 800MM annually in interest; 800MM in undeductable preferred dividends plus interest on new debt they incur in this deal which I estimate to be about 700MM in interest per annum, if the TOTAL deal flys, for a total carrying charge of 2.3MMM BEFORE paying any dividends on the common shares. Obviously they are counting on unloading other properties into a buyers market plus having to consider those properties contribute to revenue.

The bank said Occidental should be able to cover $4.4B in bonds due in 2021, but turning to the high yield market for future maturities would ""materially add to the corporate interest burden.""

However, in 2004, the SEC approved a Final Rule that changed the deadlines to 60 days for Form 10-K for ""accelerated filers""; meaning issuers that have a public float of at least $75 million, that have been subject to the Exchange Act's reporting requirements for at least 12 calendar months, that previously have filed at least one annual report, and that are not eligible to file their quarterly and annual reports on Forms 10-QSB and 10-KSB. These shortened deadlines were to be phased in over a three-year period, however in 2004 the SEC postponed the three-year phase in by one year. In December 2005, the SEC created a third category of ""large accelerated filers,"" accelerated filers with a public float of over $700 million. As of December 27, 2005, the deadline for filing for large accelerated filers was still 75 days, however beginning with the fiscal year ending on or after December 15, 2006, the deadline was changed to 60 days. For other accelerated filers the deadline remains at 75 days and for non-accelerated filers the deadline remains at 90 days.

4331,"Not exactly sure why all the doom and gloom. The stock is solid. Debt is high but being restructured and paid. Q1 had assets in transition that were not finalized due to a rising oil cost meaning those assets were now worth more so the updated checks hadn’t cleared. Q2 will show the larger debt pay downs. On top of that you have high FCF that will be another increase over Q1. With current oil price of $63 (which its been all over 65+) we’re looking at a FCF for Q2 of about $2.1billion. Pare that with the asset sales and the debt load is going to start dropping quickly. Taking the div to .01 was a great move and hopefully they don’t budge that for a bit.With the drop in debt from Q2 they’ll start getting close to their investor grade status which will open the stock to more institutions. They were originally looking at 4Q21 profitability with $43 oil. We’re $20 higher. Wouldn’t be surprised if that’s moved to Q2. Chemical is starting to find its way with inflation and other costs driving up its value. Midstream should start being less a drain as the Permian is opened up. They can increase their production pretty significantly if they need. With oil in the $60+ range they’ll be turning on the tap. The stock is worth what someone is willing to pay for it. That’s all. Just because people are selling doesn’t mean much. The true value is still there. Large institutions doing sector wide sales hits everyone. The stock is down but it’s definitely worth more than where it’s at. The debt for the ANadarko acquisition is solidly being handled at these oil numbers (that includes Buffett’s 8%) and the asset value of the Permian fields gained though the acquisition. WTI during the bidding process of 2019 was around $52. While not the best negotiated deal OXY now has those fields with $60+ oil. There’s a lot to like here from my point of view. I’m not a knee-jerk kind of seller though. Plus you keep letting the Middle East heat up and you’re going to see what he price push $70. Vicki was very smart for the acquisition of anadarko. Darko was ranked 48th of 50 for their efficiency in drilling. Meanwhile Oxy has matured and refined their process taking it from $200/ft in 2015 to $135/ft now. So not only did they get the large asset grab that’s increased about 20% in value since they’ve also managed to DRASTICALLY increase their efficiency on that acreage. It was a great idea to acquire but Vicki was very poor in her execution. Since then the div has been cut, Icahn is on the board along with a couple others, the entire direction of the company has taken a turn due to Icahn pushing these decisions, and frankly without outside influencing factors (world wide virus, comet slamming into the planet, Joe Biden being an idiot) this company definitely is worth more than where it’s at.

4430,"An aggressive acquisition puts the dividend at riskOccidental Petroleum has one of the highest yielding dividends among oil producers at 7%. The company's yield has risen significantly this year due to a 25% decline in its stock price as a result of its controversial acquisition of rival Anadarko Petroleum.Occidental Petroleum wanted to buy Anadarko so badly that it outbid Chevron by $5 billion. That's on top of the near 40% premium Chevron offered for Anadarko. The company thus had to secure high-cost financing to pay for the cash-heavy $38 billion deal. That added a significant amount of debt to its balance sheet, which is weighing on its stock price.Given the added interest expenses, Occidental doesn't currently expect to generate enough free cash flow to cover its dividend until 2022. That's assuming oil prices don't slump, which would put its cash flow under even more pressure.Occidental is taking steps to reduce this financial burden by selling assets. It agreed to unload Anadarko's African assets in an $8.8 billion deal with French oil giant Total. It's also reportedly shopping its stake in Anadarko's former MLP, Western Midstream. If the company can get a good value for the $10 billion to $15 billion in assets it aims to sell, and oil prices cooperate, then the dividend should survive.

Because we're ALL still undervalued, and sharks know it.All of our oilers are profitting MORE than enough at WTI anywhere above $55, let alone even in the $60s. Let me give a soft reminder of 5Y historical price history weighted against WTI prices for each ticker:On Dec 2nd, 2016, the prices for each ticker were as follows:$CPE 172.40 (17.24 pre-RS)$CDEV 18.06$MRO 18.20$OXY 70.85$XOM 87.04Likewise, on that date on Dec 2nd, 2016, Crude WTI prices closed at a mere $51.68 per barrel.Yet, all of these tickers are way lower than those prices despite much higher sentiment and WTI prices. So, one word: UNDERVALUED. What's inevitable, we know, is that the world WILL open back up -- the only matter is when.

The pain is plentiful in the road ahead.
