0,"Grown men walking around with masks on. Whatever happened to the “land of the brave”. Poosays afraid of the gubbermint. Probably can’t even satisfy their woman either. Hey doc, I need a bigger Cialis dose. Please ... pretty please. And what’s with all the compliant CEOs, promoting the covid scam? Leaders? Ha. Na. Just following orders. Male CEOs making good candidates for transgender surgery. Such are the ways of Masons and Jesuits. Not only do they give up their liberty by having to submit to those higher up the secret society ladder, but they sacrifice their manhood so that they can leap frog over the more talented and more masculine on the corporate ladder. Rich poosays. Not impressed by the feminine mask wearers and secret society folk.",0.988
1,"Mike Roman is a good speaker. He does not stammer much and gets to the point. But he says this:“Underlying stable trends in these markets look to be improving ...”I think I must live on a different planet. Central banks in most major economies are printing money to buy up the bad investments of banks and industries. The numbers are stupendous. Hundreds of billions each month. Now what would happen if these enormous bailouts ceased? Total collapse. Okay, so what will happen if they continue? Hyperinflation followed by total collapse. Pick your poison. The bottom line is that markets are not improving. We are living on borrowed time. Roman needs to listen to the music because the song is coming to an end.",-0.4894

They demanded the relevant government documents proving that all federally approved vaccines had been tested for quality over the past 32 years — and there were none.Here are the huge legal and practical implications in this legal victory for the American people:A recent US court case revealed there has been no quality control over vaccines manufactured by big-pharma for at least 32 years. Autism rates are excepted to drop ramatically now that parents can stop the poison being injected into their kidso This means that the US Department of Health and Human Services and all vaccine makers have been lying to the American people for over 30 years about the effectiveness and safety of vaccines; this mayultimately mean that continuing the existence — at least in their current form — of five US “healthcare” agencies are now in doubt: the CDC, the FDA, the IOM, the NIH and the “Health” part of DHHS itself;this may also threaten the existence of state medical boards and exclusive medical guilds like the AMA:o This means that vaccine makers have been fraudulently exempt from what all other pharmaceutical drug makers have been forced to do concerning biannual recertification for quality and effectiveness — meaning that that their vaccines have never been tested for quality and have had no proven safety or effectiveness for over 30 years;o This case can now be legally cited by all parents fraudulently mandated by any government/organizational regulation/requirements that they must vaccinate their children for school or any other activity to stopthe forced vaccination of their children;o This case can now be legally cited by all employees being mandated by their employers to be vaccinated in order to retain their jobs;o This case can now be legally cited by all those who seek compensation for vaccine injury, making it likely that the pharmacidical vaccine industry can in the near future be legally bankrupted out of existence, like Bayer-Monsanto after the landmark legal victory won by the dying landscaper in San Francisco several weeks ago, as well as their stock value plummeting precipitously ...",0.9974

It is a disgrace that these CEO?s sat on their hands let our great country down. To start with I would have circled the wagons of my Engineering departments and any and all of our Machine shop resources. These many resources would then be tasked with working around the clock making the machine parts need to duplicate the old machines that we have blue prints for.The 2 companies I mentioned have tens of thousands of employees, they have these resources no doubt. Not to utilize these resources is criminal in nature (people are dying). Any and all other work in these machines shops would be put aside until these machines were reproduced. While all this #$%$ is going on for the first wave of new machines I would instruct my purchasing and tooling engineers to send out prints to all of our best outside Tool shop vendors. I would instruct these vendors to drop other projects we have going on and start the machine work needed to add even more machines to be made. This would be the second wave of added capacity needed to make these life safeing masks. Note- For the electronics needed for these machines the same efforts would be in progress to mirror what the Tool shops and Machine vendors were doing. Instead it has been over 4 months and 3M and Honeywell have done nothing the proof is you can?t find these masks anywhere in any store. All we hear from them is excuses!

256,"Bad, one sided reporting. The story makes no sense. 1) 3M directed their distributors that health care providers, federal, state and local government agency orders were being prioritized. They had developed a process to do this which was certainly beyond what they normally do to process orders.2) Call any 3M authorized distributor and ask them if they have inventory of N95 masks. The answer will be no as 3M is shipping the orders received to the prioritized customers directly.This will help eliminate any threat of any distributor placing large orders for their inventory.3) The Florida state rep said he called 3M to complain. Who did he talk to? Did he talk to someone in their health care or safety business? Did he call the CEO? No offense but if he called, I am guessing he reached a first line contact who had no idea what he was talking about when he voiced his complaint.4) I read that he said he called 20 distributors? Is that correct? I also read he had an order in for a month and the distributor required the money upfront and could not provide a delivery date. I understand no delivery date as this is a very fluid process with new priorities coming forth everyday but why would he place an order with a distributor that required 100% payment upfront? Did he find the same terms with all 20 distributors he called? My guess is no so why would he do this? Perhaps his order was so large, the distributor wanted to make sure it was a real order but most distributors do not require 100% payment before the product ships. 5) Did all 20 distributors tell him they wouldn’t sell to the state of Florida in favor of selling customers outside the US for more money? Again, my guess is no! So who told him that and why bash 3M if some greedy, unprofessional distributor actually said this to him. If he truly wanted to fix this, he could have called 3M and spoken to a qualified representative of the safety or health business and reported what actually took place. 3M would research this and if found true, would take immediate action against that distributor. The state also has officials where this should have been reported. Did he report it to Florida state authorities? If so, who and what are they doing about it? Summary, just too much missing on this story to give it any merit at all. Bashing a company like 3M is counterproductive in a time where there is great need for their products and the products of so many companies like them. Bashing a large group of distributors who are working hard to supply and keeping their doors open for those in need is also irresponsible. If it was one single distributor or a couple of distributors that actually did what was claimed, call them out. They would deserve it but lets make sure of the facts.",0.9985

(If you did the latter it would take you 20 years to pay off your debt at 2% interest). Now substitute the “Federal government” for you, and you will see that the latter option under C. is, well, not an option. What you are left with is your debt increasing by at least your annual earnings each year and an ultimate bankruptcy. This is basic math people. We will surpass a total debt of 30 trillion next year.

The interviews have plenty of substance since they reveal many other items in detail, including the close friendship that he and Nicolas Rockefeller shared. But now in Minnesota, there has been revealed yet another datapoint of foreknowledge: the rapid closing of the Bachelor Farmer Restaurant. Eric Dayton who is the grandson of JD Rockefeller III, moved to close his popular restaurant way back in April. I’m so doing, he cited the virus: “We are already walking a fine line before COVID-19, and given that no one knows how long the impacts of this pandemic will last, or what the new normal will be, I do not see a viable path forward.”Interesting that at that point in time do many other restaurants were sticking it out, but he had the foresight to close his doors rapidly. Now all of this could be dismissed as good business decision making and coincidental if not for the asserted participation of the Rockefellers in the Kennedy Assassination and in 911. And let’s not forget that they also are purveyors of the global warming hoax. But here’s the real kicker: their family was the moving force behind not only the creation of the Federal Reserve system but also of the present day alleopathic medical system — see Mullins, “Secrets of the Federal Reserve” and “Murder by Injection”.

563,"Amy Klobuchar’s father was a journalist for the Minnesota newspaper, the Star Tribune, now commonly called the Star and Sickle. He became an alcoholic. In light of Operation MockingBird, many suspect that the old man started to drink excessively once he got on the CIA payroll. The conflict was too much, so they say. Then as Hennepin County prosecutor, his daughter got her chance to become a US Senator because of her suspect prosecution of Michael Zebuhr’s “murderers”. Klobuchar got three innocent young black kids to confess to Zebuhr’s murder to take the heat off the real culprits — so it is believed since witnesses to the murder got the license plate of the real assailants’ vehicle and the police apprehended them, only to have them oddly released hours later. For those if you who are not aware, Zebuhr was an early 911 Truther, working under Professor Judy Wood. Wood was a founding member of Scholars For 911Truth. Thus, the Klobuchar/CIA connection was established. She convicted innocents in exchange for a US Senate seat. So Klobuchar has to be their phony mouthpiece, which is why she’s making her crazy coup claims. Why asked why the 3 young black kids killed Zebuhr, Klobuchar angrily shot back “I don’t care!” She has never commented further on the prosecution of those kids or in the allegations that it was malicious at best. Nor has she ever commented on she or her father’s alleged connections to the CIA. alleged CIA c",-0.967

In 1986 the Feds prevented the plaintiffs bar from protecting the child; now the liberals are seeking to prevent the mother from protecting her own child. They’ve succeeded in California and at least 3 other states. Bills have been introduced in many other states, including Minnesota, by the democrats to stop the mother from protecting her own child from the dangers of vaccination. The manufactured covid 19 crisis is providing further impetus to get these bills introduced and passed by the liberals. Did you know that the flu vaccine is loaded with mercury, yet pediatricians and OBGYNs routinely recommend the shot to pregnant mothers? The pregnant mother would have to be crazy to not want a shot containing mercury for her child, particularly when recommended by these highly skilled professionals.

In other words, the poor will pay up the nose to bailout all these people and entities. And who will benefit?: the owners of hard assets like 3M stock and option holders. So the poor will be feeding the rich and will be buying them slopeside condos in Colorado so they can kick back and smoke a little rope between ski runs. Only the devil himself could have devised such an evil system. And just who were these devils who turned the founding fathers’ equitable system on its head?

Cutting lower level positions will temporarily look like a cost savings tactic but every time this is done, valuable knowledge walks out the door with no one ready to pick it up. 3M has done this every time their business softens and the ramifications of doing so are now evident. Although they have many issues, have to say that their R & D ROI is poor. Just nothing new coming out of their labs that change the basis of competition and that can demand the high margins 3M is used to receiving. Growth by acquisition has been their way which has driven up debt without fixing some of their core issues.

First they tell us there’s very little inflation; then they tell us it’s caused by people being employed. Well, as I just pointed out, nearly all commodities have rising prices way beyond 2% (using their definition of inflation). And employment has got nothing to do with whether prices rise. Prices rise because more money is being placed in circulation, making each parcel of currency worth less. We had full employment for almost the whole 20th century yet we did not have rising prices ever. They dropped coincident with productivity improvements. Will they continue to place more federal reserve notes in circulation? Of course. They have to!!The gubbermint only takes in around $3T, but they already spent that amount in less than three months. So, we’ve got about 9 months of federal government spending in 2021 that will be paid for through inflation!

House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, reiterated the idea that many legislators may well be among the elderly or medically vulnerable populations vaccinated early, thereby possibly allowing the Legislature to resume some business.“At some point, if we need to vaccinate anybody in the Legislature who is themselves high risk or has someone high risk living in their household — employees, whatever — if that helps us get back in person sooner, I would support that,” said Daudt, R-Crown. “The Legislature is a relationship business and relationships cultivate much better in person.”3. Senate Minority Leader Susan Kent, DFL-Woodbury, said lawmakers have an obligation to themselves and their staff as well as the people of Minnesota. “I appreciate what Sen. Gazelka is saying in terms of if we could get the essential folks vaccinated at the Legislature, but we have an obligation to our own communities,” Kent said. “If we come together and if people come to the Legislature and intermingle and then go back all over the state of Minnesota, that’s how spread happens.”These people are not paid to tell others what kind of medicines they should put in their bodies.

In short, the American worker pays for the wealth transfers through income, social security, estate, and inflation taxes.

When volume impacts and selling price changes are included, the sales number is negative. P/E, a number representative of the number of years it takes to recoup your investment, should not be double digits. 3. 3M sales are not keeping up with rampant money-supply inflation by the Fed. And all inflationary bubbles must be followed by deflationary collapses or hyperinflation followed by collapse. 4. 3M has had very large increases on the debt side of its balance sheet over the last ten years, further harming earnings, for this debt carries interest payments (which if not paid off) that may have to be refinanced at higher interest rate Such interest could be substantially higher if the bond bubble implodes. 5.

1456,"Per Alasdair MaCleod:“We know, therefore, that the financial asset bubble itself is on a last hurrah, and its imploding deflation, driven initially perhaps by a resolving of the tension between the BLS’s CPI and the true rate of price inflation, is only a matter of time. We can identify a few key reasons likely to trigger the bursting of the financial asset bubble:• A growing realisation that the covid-19 shutdowns are additional to the credit cycle and liquidity problems that surfaced in September 2019 and that a post-covid-19 recovery will be followed by a deeper and more intractable slump.• Liquidity problems in the banking system and for its non-financial customers, together with the escalation of bad debts are leading towards bank failures. Fortunately, US banks are generally less leveraged than those elsewhere. But Eurozone, Japanese, Chinese and some UK G-SIB banks pose exceptional systemic risks, making their continued survival as independent commercial banks unlikely beyond the near term.• Foreign selling of US financial assets and the repatriation of their funds.The first two bullet points will simply guarantee a further escalation in the rate of monetary inflation as the partnership of central banks and state treasury departments desperately attempt to contain a deteriorating situation. But foreign repatriation of funds will hit the dollar hardest, making it lose purchasing power against other currencies as financial asset values collapse. The euro, yen and Chinese yuan will appear perversely strong for a brief period, with their central banks desperate to contain the rises in their own currencies in the belief they are deflationary…The sheer scale of dollar inflation will also mean that global commodity and raw material prices will rise, signalling that the dollar’s purchasing power is falling.Empirical evidence in these situations indicates that an inflating currency is hit first in the foreign exchanges, before the domestic population discovers what is happening to their money. There is then followed by a growing panic among domestic users to dump money. In the best documented monetary collapses, such as Germany’s of 1923, cash was increasingly demanded in order to be spent as soon as possible, and evidence from Venezuela suggests this is still true today. However, more sophisticated financial systems have eliminated cash for most transactions, replacing it with credit and debit cards as well as other forms of electronic money. Internet banking and shopping further speeds up the process of turning money into goods.This has the effect of speeding up the spending process significantly, leading to a more rapid loss of purchasing power compared with a currency whose users first make a trip to their bank to encash their deposits before heading for the shops. Additionally, a generation of cryptocurrency-savvy millennials have been forewarned of the consequences of fiat money inflation and stand prepared to ditch currencies earlier than their equivalents would have been in the past.Taking these factors into account, the collapse in purchasing power of a currency which has been deployed to save financial assets and failed, once the general public finally understands the consequences, will likely be surprisingly rapid. In 1923 Germany, the final collapse took roughly six months. In 2020 America it could take as little as a few weeks.Other currencies that refer to the dollar for their relative values are sure to suffer the same fate, not helped by the fact that their central banks have been pursuing similar monetary policies and will likely cooperate with each other to the bitter end.“",0.9709

Yes, inflation is a wealth transfer to the member banks of the Federal Reserve system and to the government. It is nothing else. They brought on covid and shut down the economy so that covid could be the reason for zero bound once again. After all, they did not want to admit that we were in a death spiral for monetary interventions in the bond market. I mean, we had the “greatest economy ever” ... so if not covid, why else were we going zero bound again?Well, for the simple reason that the bond bubble was ready to implode after decades of Fed interventions. The Federal Reserve system was to blame until covid entered the scene. How convenient. So now the Fed finds itself in denial. Inflation is running rampant, but they are still trying to reach the magical 2% target. And as inflation makes the banking and business sectors worry and thus begin to hunker down, what will the Fed do? And what will they do when the bond market notices the inflation and the 10 year rising toward 2% or more?Well, they will interfere in the bond market yet again, printing trillions to bring the long end of the yield curve down.

1820,"Want to End Governor Walz' Emergency Powers RIGHT NOW? Senate Republicans have an ace up their sleeve that they finally employed for the first time last month... They have the power to FIRE Walz' Commissioners. Especially the one he just weaponized against our small businesses. Let me explain. As you know, Governor Walz has used emergency powers to shut down small businesses and trample on our civil liberties. But now Walz is weaponizing Minnesota Dept of Health Commissioner Jan Malcom to act as a hit squad on our business community. According to Kare11, Malcolm is ""planning to conduct extra compliance checks for COVID-19 safety measures at bars and restaurants in the coming weeks."" Violations of certain COVID orders issued unilaterally by Walz carry fines of up to $25,000 and 90 days in jail for business owners; an aggregious use of power since criminal laws can't be passed without the legislative branch. It's hard enough for small businesses to thrive in Walz' ""One Minnesota"" with constant threats of rioting/looting and adapting to the new marketplace post-COVID. Now our small businesses will have one further worry: Walz' hit squad led by Malcolm. This isn't the only issue with Jan Malcolm's tenure as the Commissioner of the state's most critical department. It was revealed back in May that the Dept of Health was using undergraduate students to determine COVID modeling data, which has now been found to be completely flawed. Walz uses Malcolm's statistics as the basis for his abusive executive orders. Many Republican legislators at the Capitol allege that the Department has inflated its COVID case numbers, including Senator and physician Scott Jensen. Malcolm also admitted that Walz' original order prohibiting surgeries in Minnesota was a mistake. “If I could roll back time I would not have had us use the word ‘elective’ procedures when talking about the original executive order"" Malcolm said. Certainly this gross abuse of emergency powers led to the deaths of Minnesotans who should have received important medical procedures in that period of time. Weaponizing the Dept of Health against small businesses in our state is about as cold-hearted, totalitarian as it gets. Walz continues to act as if he is capable of creating his owns laws and his compliant Commissioners like Malcolm are his enforcers. Are we still a free country?! Although Malcom is commonly referred in the media and at the Capitol as ""Commissioner"", her appointment by Walz has never been approved by the Republican controlled Minnesota Senate. It currently awaits floor action that Majority Leader Paul Gazelka or his leadership team, like Assistant Majority Leader, Warren Limmer, can bring to a floor vote. In other words, at any time, Senate Republicans can do something about Walz' weaponization of the Dept of Health: they could fire Jan Malcolm! Republicans have been kicked in the teeth by Walz’ authoritarian edict that House Democrats continue to rubber-stamp. They need to fight fire with fire and send Malcom packing to send a message that these illegal Emergency Orders won’t stand and Walz will pay a price. Action 4 Liberty has been leading the charge since the beginning on passing the legislative resolutions to End Walz’ Power. We only had 15 House Republicans voting with us back in mid April. Now we have all 59 House Republicans, 4 House Democrats, and the Minnesota Senate on board. At this point, the next step that's needed is to let the Democrats know there will be a price to pay if they allow these illegal powers to continue on. Sure, the media and Democrats will cry bloody murder. But the average Minnesotan won't shed a tear watching a political appointed bureaucrat lose a job when thousands of Minnesota businesses are going under as a direct result of the Walz' Administration's toxic leadership. This is the one fighting chance we have in this state to finally hold Walz accountable for abusing the laws and ruling by authoritarian dictate. Weak Republicans need to actually stand up and fight like mad dogs. While Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison are willing to threaten jail and fines, Republicans need to pull out all the stops and rain down political bombs to send a message this will not stand. Anything less is weakness.",0.69

To be clear, central bankers may not be nefarious in nature, but their product is iniquitous.Any entity whose very purpose for existence is to destroy markets is inherently disgusting and, in the end, one that ends up being evil. At its core, the Fed is Robin-Hood in reverse, stealing from the poor by destroying their purchasing power to give to the rich by inflating their asset prices.

The weight of this first-hand testimony, along with supporting government documentation and other evidence, established without any doubt the reality of these phenomena.

2072,"The Cantillon effectOver a century before Bastiat, an Irish banker in France, Richard Cantillon, observed that new money drove up prices as it was spent. He had experienced John Law’s Mississippi bubble, which was fueled by printed money and the issuance of bank credit, so Cantillon had observed the effect. It made well-connected speculators their fortunes, whose profligate spending drove up prices for everyone else. The effect at that time was that in real terms insiders became rich and the poor got poorer. To this day the process by which this happens is known as the Cantillon effect.Now that it is official policy, the lesson for today is that a rapid increase in monetary inflation will, as the effects trickle through the economy, further impoverish the poor. It will do this by driving up prices of their essentials and reducing the purchasing power of their salaries, if they are lucky enough to still be employed. But as Cantillon pointed out in his Essai, reflecting the increased quantity of circulating money prices rise unevenly. Never has it been truer than today, when we face the combination of an unprecedented slump in economic activity combined with a sharp escalation in monetary inflation: the rich whose stocks are rising can buy their expensive toys at knockdown prices, while the poor, increasing numbers of which are newly unemployed, struggle to make ends meet with rising prices for life’s essentials…",0.8731

Highly important to investors 3M built the company those sand paper etc. i was shocked to read of the GNBT partnership. which could help in getting gov't cheese and distribution if they find vaccine cures it is within the realm of possibility and could make this company bigger than 3M. it would seem they have some really world class peptide research in the hopper and they can employ synthetic peptides that should make their end product cheaper and faster to produce and possibly more accurate to the given virus (s) .Dont know if anyone else is on the peptides track but this could be Mega huge 4 3M. maybe make the 10M do Ur own research on GNBT and share with us all as this Cov 19 is a rare WORLD  CLASS PROBLEM affecting. potentially every one on the planet.,0.9951

2297,"Our leaders in both political and corporate circles, who blame our economic troubles on covid, are sick and rotten to the core. The reason they try to divert blame to covid away from the responsible party, namely, central banking systems and their debt-based currencies, is because the latter system enriches them. But how so? And at the expense of whom? The central bankers lowered interest rates to zero (ZIRP) and printed trillions since 2008 (QE) to bail out bad banking investments and to goose the stock market. But it wasn’t simply ZIRP and QE that brought the DJIA to 30,000. These two things enabled individual corporations to acquire billions, much of which was used to buy back stock to increase earnings per share, which in turn drove stock prices higher. After all, prices follow earnings. So that explains the “how so”. The “at whose expense?” is answered simply through an education at counterfeiting. If you had a printing press in your basement, you could become rich beyond belief. The new money you printed would dilute existing dollars, making each worth less. This dilution or devaluation of the currency makes prices rise. More dollars chasing the same amount if products defines inflation. So the people who have savings lose, and they lose mostly to the persons who acquired the new money first. And if you are on the inside and know when the money supply will grow and when it will shrink, you can further benefit by buying and selling stock at those two intervals, respectively. Additionally Federal Reserve member banks are given the right to print money out of nothing to lend to borrowers at interest. Another counterfeiting operation. So now you see why the secret society leadership in corporate America and in government always speak so well of the Federal Reserve system and why they do not want it to take the blame for the tumbling economic system. The coincidental arrival of covid was the most beneficial thing that happened to them. The cheap and free money made them rich while it impoverished millions. Evil? I’d say so without hesitation.",0.9893

2328,"So, instead of stock buybacks and selling debt, they are now buying back debt with no stock buybacks. That’s a switch. And where/when did all this debt occur? Was it when they were buying back stock to the tune of hundreds of millions a quarter?Yahoo! says that 3M’s net debt went from $9B to $18B (100% increase) in the past 4 years. During much of this time frame, there were some pretty sizeable stock buybacks. So, it appears 3M was taking on billions in debt when it was at the same time paying out huge stock buyback dividends. Am I wrong? And who benefitted from the stock repurchases? And who will lose?Of course none of these actions could ever have even made a modicum of sense had the Federal Reserve not lowered interest rates through their open market asset purchases, bringing both the short and long term ends of the bond market to ridiculously low levels. Of course it is accordingly unfair to blame 3M executives for what has happened. After this concomitant swap of debt for treasury stock was running rampant all across America as the Masonic and Jesuit Corporate masters were buying back stock. And all this was happening while granny was getting a 0.25% return in her savings (also thanks to the Fed). So, at the end of the day, the whole stinking matter was a wealth transfer from savers like granny to corporate masters.

They are promulgating the false notion that the worst economic contraction in US history is all about the virus and has nothing to do with the economics behind a typical economic contraction. But the fact is, the path towards recession was already firmly in progress well prior to 2020. Hence, the reason why the Fed had already cut rates three times and was re-engaged with QE before the pandemic struck. The Wuhan virus served to severely weaken balance sheets that were already very much in disarray. So, what we have now is an abnormally severe recession that features the very normal component of an overleveraged economy.”",-0.9706
