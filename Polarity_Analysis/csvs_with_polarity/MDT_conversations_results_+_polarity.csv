So it seems to me that the Q2 2015 to Q2 2016 should have a better headline revenue #.

Jefferies Group currently has a “Buy” rating and a $93.00 target price on the stock. Jefferies Group also issued estimates for Medtronic PLC’s FY2017 earnings at $4.65 EPS.

Introduction and catalyst thesisFor more than a decade and a half, the market in surgical robotics has effectively belonged to Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG). When ISRG introduced its daVinci surgical robot in 1999, it never looked back and in 2015 held almost a 60% market share of the USD 4.2bn surgical robotics market.Mazor Robotics (NASDAQ:MZOR), has an excellent peer reviewed surgical system, growing installed base and a very strong distribution partner in Medtronic (NYSE:MDT). Not only will MZOR take some business from ISRG down the road, but at the moment, has its hands full with creating a dominating position in spine surgeries. And in a 22% a year growing market, just being present with an EU/FDA approved product, bodes very well for MZOR.Ultimately, I argue that MZOR will eventually be bought out - and who better to do that than their distribution partner MDT, which also just happens to be the master of bolt-on acquisitions in the medical technology sphere.Current consensus estimates underestimates the growth trajectory and my discounted cash flow valuation points to a fair value of 31 per share (42% upside).

66,"Thank you Motley Fool. $$$ for us.One quality stock that isn't among the most popular list on Robinhood is Medtronic (NYSE:MDT). Fewer than 12,000 Robinhood users are holding shares of the Dividend Aristocrat. Despite paying a dividend yield of 2.5% (more than the S&P 500 average of 2%) and raising its payouts for more than four decades in a row, the healthcare stock hasn't attracted much interest from Robinhood investors. But that makes the boring old dividend stock an attractive buy for income investors -- it's not volatile and not on retail investors' radars.With profits in nine straight quarters and Medtronic selling various medical products, it's a safe investment to hold for the long term. It's down 19% so far in 2020 while the S&P has fallen by a more modest 4%.But a lot of that bearishness can likely be attributed to COVID-19. Dealing with the pandemic has been a priority for hospitals and that's resulted in the deferral of many medical procedures, which has hampered Medtronic's sales. The Irish company released its fourth-quarter results on May 21, which showed sales were down 26% year over year. However, Medtronic was still able to post a profit of $646 million, showing a lot of resiliency during a very difficult time for the healthcare industry.The key takeaway from all this is that investors should avoid chasing stocks that are popular on Robinhood and instead do their own due diligence when deciding on which companies to invest in. Buying a stock because it's hot is an easy way to add a lot of volatility to your portfolio. And odds are that isn't going to be a great strategy as the economy is in a recession and the world is dealing with a pandemic -- which could suggest that another market crash may not be too far away.Now's a time to exercise caution and stick with safe stocks like Medtronic that can help get your portfolio through this adversity.",0.9962

That’s correct!This study is too small to make ANY practice-changing decisions. Most of the major cardiology studies of the past included 10,000+ patients. Small studies are highly susceptible to random error and bias. Better designed studies may prove that placebo is as good or better than stenting, but this study does nothing to support that claim. Also, don’t count on a bigger, better follow up trial because it took 3.5 years to recruit a measly 200 patients.Be skeptical about the sensational media headlines (To be fair: you should also be skeptical of my assessment, too).

Omar sounded good at the conference - he said that MDT was modeling 8% EPS growth which could have prompted profit taking by traders who rode it up from about $112. Further, given the statements from Omar and the CFO during the Q2 earnings rpt. I expect closer to 10% YOY Op EPS growth Q3 & Q4 -- and strength into FY '21 -- due to the pipeline.MDT looks good. The only area that comes to mind that underperformed is Diabetes which traces back to the delay of 670G sensors which gave up MDT's lead in closed loop systems - Diabetes segment revenue was down YOY close to 6% in the US last Q but up about 16% elsewhere. I assume that is why Diabetes has new leadership. I guess Omar gave them an EPS target to be transparent. He didn't say the 8% target was conservative but it should prove to be conservative. Revenue is growing and last Q the YOY ratio of SG&A/Rev was about 34% down from 34.8% Q2 last yr. So .8/34.8 = 2.3% improvement. That's a small % improvement but it is going the right way and that has been a long time coming. So the 80 bp improvement is supposed to improve to 120 bp improvement next Q, from memory, so that would be about a 3.5% improvement YOY. If MDT shows that Q3 it should propel EPS since revenue will be growing during a period of improving margins and that is what you want to see.

BMO also increased its price target for the stock to $94 from $87 while retaining an outperform rating.BMO left its $4.98 EPS estimate for 2018 and its $5.43 EPS estimate for 2019 unchanged. The new products driving growth include the launch of Medtronic's Resolute Onyx DES, coronary stent anda broadened portfolio for Transcatheter aortic valve replacement surgery with the larger 34mm valve, BMO said.

At that time, MDT noted it had seen some weakness in parts of its CVG business but that it expected this to be offset by strength in its MITG and RTG businesses. MDT reiterated its FY19 organic growth guidance of 5.0-5.5% but indicated it now expects to be in the middle of this range vs. the upper-end as previously expected. Mgmt also indicated that it expected its FY20 tax rate to be 16-17%, which is 100-200 bps higher than its current underlying rate of 15%, and that this could create up to a 250 bps headwind to its FY20 EPS growth.

It could also have been due in part to the news that the tax bill looked like it would be passed which would make US Corp tax rates 20% compared to 12% for Ireland. The Mazor Ceo's situation is vague but out there. It's at least a distraction and a general negative but could be minor on the impact to the MazorX system. As to the US tax rate going to 20% -- it will help MDT plc because the US subsidiary generates about 55% of revenue. Products like TVAR and mitral valve systems in pivotal trial, 670G and other promising new tech will continue to drive revenue in the US and MDT pays the same taxes as domestic corporations in the US. I believe MDT recently reported about a 17% tax rate which would include US taxes incurred. I did see that US medtech firms pay around 26% effective rate under the max 35% current scheme so medtech may go to the 20% level. So MDT would see a modest reduction. I believe during the last conference call the CFO projected 15% ahead but I don't know if that included a US rate reduction. MDT will still have a tax rate well below 20%. The first year 100% write off of depreciable assets with a 20 yr life or less for 5 years will probably make the investment commitments MDT make to Al Franken to get his support for the Covidien deal done will produce better US cash flow statements.

296,"Both Omar & Karen the CFO said they were looking for offsets to new US tax regs that will probably cost MDT about 2% this coming FY 2020 starting 5/1/19. An obvious offset was the refi and higher coupon paydown. This will create higher interest expense in Q4 for the premiums paid to call the debt but lower period interest expense starting Q1 of FY 2020. I have noticed a big pick up of after hours volumes in the stock. MDT has been trading heavily -- usually 500k shares or more -- usually 10%+ of daily volume. It does look like MDT is aggressively buying back its shares pursuant to the recent $6 B earmarked for buybacks. I looked at results for the last buyback authorization of $5 B -- there was a balance of $1.7 B after about 19 months so $3.3 B spent over 19 months or about $175 M per month. We won't find out until earnings are reported in May. Reducing the share count will be effective against increased tax expense but to be most effective share count needs to be reduced at the beginning of a period since the share count used to compute EPS is the weighted average of shares outstanding for the period.Using a $90 share price bogey, when MDT was spending $175 M per month they were buying about 1,944,000 per month.

Most if not all of the pumps send data to MDT so that data will be important to understand the extent of the injuries. I assume MDT will try to settle quickly with strong offers to settle quickly and avoid a class action. MDT needs to pull out the stops on offers to retain its base. As to the fix, it looks simple per the MDT Nov 21 letter posted earlier. A stronger plastic or metal retaining ring seems to be the answer. There is nothing else wrong with the pumps. It may involve mailing out replacement rings or exchanging the pumps where the ring has already broken. I assume it's student body left to get this resolved because the population of patients has to continue with MDT because they want the pump for quality of life. MDT will probably facilitate those who are fed up and want to switch. So bottom line is it's going to cost MDT some cash but the diabetes technology is not in question it's a dumb materials mistake for a retainer part.

At the moment, there's a rumor circling social media, and it's not a good one.A search on your favorite social network will likely yield a result that has to do with Valves these companies are involved in. According to the rumors, there is a German paper stating that the valves raise the risk of death in patients that are less sick. If this proves to be true, it could be a big hit to MDT and EW. As a result, investors are reacting.What We'll Be Watching For AheadFirst and foremost, keep in mind that this is just a rumor at the moment. The fact that Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences are both down under 5% suggests that investors aren't overreacting, which is a good thing. Nonetheless, we'll be watching MDT and EW closely for any news surrounding this story. As always, we'll bring you the news as soon as we uncover it!Update: Unfortunately this is no longer a rumor.

448,"CFO on earnings call:""Turning to our balance sheet. Our financial position remained strong. In the quarter, we completed another euro debt offering #$%$6.25 billion and used the proceeds to reduce our U.S. dollar debt and prefund our March euro debt maturities, driving roughly $80 million of additional annualized savings. This was our third euro transaction in the past year and a half. Combined, we have issued over $18 billion and our portfolio now sits with a weighted average maturity of over 12 years and a weighted average coupon of less than 2%, among the lowest of the large cap issuers and the lowest among our competitors in medtech.As I shared with you at our Investor Day last month, we remain focused on investing, both organically and inorganically through tuck-in acquisitions and minority investments to drive our long-term growth strategies. Last month, we announced the acquisition of Ai Biomed to expand our ENT portfolio. In addition, we closed our acquisition of Avenu Medical and Peripheral Vascular earlier this month and we announced the completion of our Medicrea acquisition in spine last week.We expect both our organic and inorganic investments to fuel a longer term revenue growth acceleration, ultimately creating strong returns for our shareholders, supplemented by our strong and growing dividend. We are an S&P Dividend Aristocrat having increased our dividend for 43 years, and our current yield of 2.1% places as in the upper quintile of S&P 500 Healthcare Companies.Now turning to our outlook, particularly with the rising cases of COVID around the world, the impact to our business remains difficult to predict. So we will continue to not provide our typical guidance. That said, I do want to give you a sense of the recovery ahead. While it is still early in our third quarter, we've seen our average weekly sales track ahead of the same weeks in the second quarter. So while there are pockets of more restrictions and delayed procedures around the globe, the impact to us has thus far been limited.As we've said before, hospitals are better equipped now to handle COVID patients and remain open to serve non-COVID patients. And over time and with education, patient fear is not as heightened as it was last spring and early summer. While there is still uncertainty ahead, if the recovery trend continues as it has to-date, our third quarter revenue could be flat to slightly up year-over-year on an organic basis. And we would continue to expect to return to normal organic revenue growth on a two-year stacked basis by our fiscal fourth quarter.""",0.9896

House, SA News Editor Results from a 6,983-subject global Phase 4 study, WRAP-IT, assessing the effectiveness of Medtronic's (NYSE:MDT) TYRX Absorbable Antibacterial Envelope in reducing infections in patients receiving cardiac implantable electronic devices showed a treatment benefit. The data were presented at the American College of Cardiology Annual Scientific Sessions in New Orleans.Patients receiving a device with the TYRX mesh envelope experienced 40% less risk of major (systemic) infection and 61% less risk of pocket (local infection in the tissue surrounding the device) infection compared to standard-of-care preoperative antibiotics with no increase in procedure-related or system-related risk.Specifically, at month 12, 1.2% of patients receiving a standard device experienced a major infection compared to 0.7% for those receiving a TYRX-encased device (p=0.04). The company does not provide the pocket infection rates.The TYRX envelope, approved in the U.S. in 2013 and in Europe in 2014, is designed to stabilize the device after implantation while releasing the antimicrobial agents minocycline and rifampin over at least seven days.

475,"...Yes, I was referring to US tax based, same sector investment alternatives like Stryker, Edwards, J&J, and so on. The key is that US corporations are taxed on global income less deductions for foreign tax paid. But the US can only tax foreign corporations on US revenues. To try and do otherwise would result in quick retaliation. MDT has been running around a 15% - 16% blended overall tax rate with the base US rate at 21% covering 53% of MDT's revenues. Taxes are complicated for multinationals but the back of an envelope shows MDT with a current positive gap of 5% - 5.5%. If the US corporate rate goes from 21% to 28% or up 7% it would raise MDT's overall blended rate by about 3.5% to 18.5% - 19% compared to 28%. The positive gap would then be 9% - 9.5% from the new base rate of 28%, up from the current 5% - 5.5% positive gap. This is why the inversion looks so good at this point. Because if rates do go up to 28% the positive gap for MDT will approach a dime on a dollar of global taxable income and that is a lot of cash flow that MDT will be able to reinvest in the business or payout to shareholders. Omar was a True Believer in the inversion and pushed it through in the face of direct opposition from President Obama resulting in the Treasury Sect. Jack Lew changing the rules for corporations trying to invert, for the sole purpose of stopping MDT from switching to Ireland. Omar was right.",0.9934

517,"There is a Motley Fool article that says the recent MDT upgrade was ""wrong"". The section about the balance sheet showing about $14 bil of net debt and the author states for that reason alone indicates financial weakness is in my opinion misleading. It's misleading because it's acquisition debt incurred when MDT had to get past the new road blocks set up by Mr Lew at Mr Obama's behest. The COV acquisition added about $10 bil of revenue to MDT's run rate of about $20 bil so it was a 50% revenue pop in obviously a one-off transformation transaction. As announced the next $5 bil of maturities will be retired from the apx. $6 bil of cash from the sale to Cardinal Health. And given the remainder total Gross margin shifting from the mid to high 60% - 68% range it should be close to 75% this fiscal year started 5/1. That means a pop in the Operating Margin and better net free cash flow brought down from sales. From the article:""Balance sheetMind you, that's still a pretty good number. Medtronic only reported GAAP earnings of $2.8 billion over the last 12 months, so free cash flow is rolling in at a rate appreciably faster than reported income.But now let's see what the balance sheet tells us. With a $109.2 billion market capitalization, Medtronic has $14.4 billion in cash and $28.8 billion in debt on its balance sheet -- thus $14.4 billion in net debt. That's not exactly something I would characterize as a ""strong balance sheet."" Nor does it yield a particularly appealing valuation. Medtronic stock is trading for an enterprise value-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 28.7 -- which is far from cheap.""I'll add that there is no reason for MDT to be cheap. The statement is a straw man. At about $78.50 MDT is trading around 15x this year's analyst estimated Operating EPS. Buffett should be buying MDT with its big moat. If you follow the stock you know Edward's just said they have lost share in Europe in TAVR -- I'll add that I've heard the head of CVG say MDT was taking share. And MDT's TMVR for mitral valve replacement had a very successful pilot trial with successful implant of 98% - 49/50 - which led to the Apollo trial which started 10/2017 and is an FDA approved pivotal trial to test the safety and efficacy of MDT's TMVR. Mitral valve disease is more common than aortic valve disease. With the kind of resources devoted to CVG there is a good chance the TMVR will be approved for high risk patients when the 1200 patient trial is completed.

It's a Buffett stock, he says he wants to own stocks who treat investors with reverence. I assume MDT's 50% of cash flow to investors qualifies MDT. I expect that robotics will be exciting but as with the 670G device we saw a delay for commercial sale of robotic surgical devices, except for Mazor.

Morgan Securities predict, citing the sector’s potential to combine the ‘strong vaccine-driven recovery trade’ with ‘positive underlying sector fundamentals.’ Despite a less bullish timeline for recovery, the analysts from SVB Leerink shared a similar view adding that the pandemic-driven in telehealth could benefit ‘all medtech subsectors.’According to JPM forecasts, in 2021, the industry top-line and bottom-line will expand at 10.1% and 24.8% YoY, compared to an estimated decline of 0.5% and 12.7% YoY in 2020, respectively.The analysts at JPM led by Robbie Marcus term the upcoming year as ‘a tale of two cities,’: a strong back half, benefited from the vaccine rollout, easy comps, and the deferred procedures, contrasting the first half likely impacted from the pandemic headwinds amid the ongoing surge in cases and another post-holiday COVID-19 wave.Despite the near-term uncertainty, they view the ‘underlying fundamentals of MedTech as healthy,’ with ‘meaningful innovation and undertreated end-markets’ supporting ‘a return to normalized growth in the mid-single digits’ in the future.The report from JPM name Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) and Dexcom (NASDAQ:DXCM) as top large-cap picks and Insulet (NASDAQ:PODD) and AtriCure (NASDAQ:ATRC) as top small-cap picks.For Medtronic, the proven track record of execution, reinforced by the new management and improving fundamentals, should ‘shine-through’ in a post-pandemic scenario, the analysts point out, expecting the company, with a valuation gap to peers, to outperform the broader group with multiple expansion along the way.With pharmacy channel headwinds behind, Dexcom is ‘well-positioned ahead of a G7 launch’ as the company focuses on deeper penetration and new market opportunities to ensure long-term success, the report suggests.Having demonstrated resilience amid pandemic headwinds, both Insulet and AtriCure have a 'long runway for growth,’ the researchers write, citing their upcoming product launches.",0.998

683,"MSource: FactSt You can see that three sectors known for stocks with attractive dividends and relatively low price volatility -- consumer staples, telecommunications and utilities -- have fared well this year, as investors have chased higher yields as interest rates have sunk ever lower. The energy and materials sectors have been recovering, following dramatic declines in energy and commodity prices. There will always be recessions and commodity market disruptions, so you will see these patterns again, although we cannot predict when they will happen. But even though the political climate is negative for the health-care sector, with Obamacare failing (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-obamacare-is-in-political-purgatory-2016-10-25) and both major presidential candidates bashing drug companies, the sector is likely to continue to be a steady and strong long-term performer. That is because it's a safe bet that the aging of populations in developed countries will continue, with the trend being followed by emerging economies. Supply and demand continually disrupts the sectors that rely on commodity prices. But demand for health-related services, including pharmaceuticals, biotechnology development, hospitals, and nursing and assisted-living facilities, should continue to increase for decades to come. In light of this year's weakness for the sectors, we decided to list S&P 500 health-care stocks that met the following criteria: Eleven companies made the list.

685,"From MedlineThe company will host a live audio webcast of the RAS Investor Update to provide access to all interested stakeholders. The webcast and slides can be accessed by clicking on the Investor Events link at http://investorrelations.medtronic.com on Sept. 24.Want More on Surgical Robotics? Join Us for the Session Developing & Manufacturing a State-of-the-Art Robotic Radio-Surgical System: Supplier Partnership Strategies for a Successful Launch, to Be Held at MD&M Minneapolis Oct. 23 - 24, at the Minneapolis Convention Center.Last month during an earnings call, the medtech giant said investors and analysts would get their first look at the technology – and noted details would come at a later time. Up until the last few months, there had been some secrecy surrounding Medtronic’s surgical platform. The company had been quiet about the device that was originally expected to launch in 2018. However, delays pushed the timeline for the device back and gave Medtronic’s competitor Intuitive Surgical, a longer runway.In June, Medtronic shocked the surgical robotics space when it revealed a 4-year-partnership with Karl Storz. It was revealed in the collaboration that El Segunda, CA-based Karl Storz would incorporate its 3D visualization components into Medtronic’s surgical robotics platform.About a month after the collaboration announcement, Sunnyvale, CA-based Intuitive Surgical acquired the robotic endoscope portion of Schölly Fiberoptic’s business for an undisclosed sum. Schölly Fiberoptic is a player in the field of visualization systems for minimally invasive diagnostic and surgical applications, headquartered in Germany — and one of Intuitive’s strategic suppliers.Medtronic’s reveal next week will allow Intuitive to get a clearer picture of one of its top competitors. But questions remain about Verb Surgical another one of the surgical robotic pioneer’s competitors. Recall that Verb is a joint venture involving Johnson & Johnson’s Ethicon and Verily Life Sciences, an Alphabet company. Verb has been pretty quiet about its technology offering a demo to senior leadership from Verily, J&J, and Alphabet in 2017.",0.985

694,"Dave says, ""Current pullback is insane.""Agreed, MDT started to weaken after St Jude announced a problem with batteries in implanted devices. Then on Oct 21 MDT issued a PR which pointed to webcasts on 10/26 & 10/30 that would include ""Investor updates"". I didn't know what to make of this but from 10/21 to yesterday 10/26 the DOW and S&P were flat and MDT was down another 3%. I started to listen to the webcast live but the audio was horrible. I then switched from Chrome to Windows and it got a little better audio wise but the presentation was hard to follow. A woman was talking at a high rate of speed and I just gave up. Now I don't see a written follow up with a summary ""Investor update"" so if you didn't want to struggle thru the presentation you have no update. I thought that was dumb so I found that on the MDT site an Investor Relations email link. You're limited to a few lines for some reason - I told them the written announcement of an investor update in the future and then a crummy webcast without a written investor update was a bad idea. I got a reply a few minutes later blaming yesterday's weakness on ""a competitor's weakness"" which was Edwards Lifesciences. I think the mismanagement of an announced ""investor update"" added to the weakness. I added at $81.I don't know why they limit what investors can tell them via MDT.com because I got a quick reply so it doesn't seem they are getting swamped.

700,Another strong day in a down market. I noticed a big pick up of after market trading -- back in February around the time MDT announced a $6 bil add to share buybacks. The 10k hasn't been filed yet so I can't see exactly how much was spent during Q4 -- looked like over $2 bil which is a big pickup over the usual pace. And after hours volumes are still up -- around 900k bought last Friday night -- with big individual trades of 300k. After hours are when many accumulation trades are done -- arranged by wall st brokers and executed at night - for buybacks or accumulation by investors. At any rate I read the big volumes as a good sign for LT holders.,0.9821
701,"Since MDT can now access 100% of it's $14b cash & equivalents and all of its future operating cash flow I hope to see more than another 7% dividend raise. Assuming FTR's FY 18 comes in at $4.74 then the $1.84 dividend is a payout ratio of 39%. That would leave buybacks at 11% to hit the 50% of trailing earnings MDT payout target -- that would be $.52 of trailing earnings. The buyback should be bolstered with some of the $14b, along with debt pay down. If FTR can get a Moody's hike by getting debt down it would enhance MDT's credit profile on Wall St beyond a one rank gain since it validates the near $50b COV acquisition so if another one comes along MDT debt should be easily placed at favorable terms. However, MDT needs to demonstrate solid Diabetes growth. The new 670g system with sensor manufacturing capacity in place should show 20%+ YoY Q3 18 reported 5/20. The 90k J&J patients may start to impact sales. Omar said that Diabetes was up 17% YoY Q2 because people were willing to buy a 670g even though it was understood they could not get a sensor supply to use the device. It would seem to follow that some of the JNJ pump users would switch even if their current pumps are under warranty. If MDT doesn't beat the $1.39 Operating EPS est. for Q3 I will be surprised. The wild card is the verdict in the transfer pricing IRS lawsuit, which should come soon. The IRS wants to overturn a tax court ruling and amend the 2006 return to show $1.4b more of taxable income.",0.9951

730,"Nice to see a bid in for MDT. I have been impressed with core profitability which has allowed MDT to post positive earnings with revenue and gross margins depressed. MDT's tried and seasoned products have higher than average margin and cover a lot of SG&A. So that's a clarified fundamental that can now be attributed to MDT's established product portfolio. Mgt & BOD seem to have managed well given no reduction in ongoing R&D, the extra $337 mil of diabetes R&D added from the Blackstone Life Sciences fund, and the 7% dividend increase was a positive signal to look past C-19. MDT is a Buffet stock. Even if US tax rates go up it's on about 53% of revenue.",0.9804

We did accelerate our share repurchase activity by shifting the vast majority of the remaining activity for the fiscal year into the third quarter given our share price. Third quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.383 billion shares.Regarding our dispute with the IRS related to Puerto Rico transfer pricing, the tax court issued their final ruling late last month. Under the terms of the decision, we would experience an increase to our annual accessible cash generation of approximately $225 million as well as the movement of approximately $3 billion of cash on our balance sheet from trapped to accessible. The decision could be appealed. But if it is not, we could begin to see movement of a portion of the trapped cash in fiscal year 2018.

And we think underlying was turning the prior way, but it was muddled by the tough weather issues that we had across the United States. But we saw a clear turn last week. And so things have really started to improve as we predicted. We do remain optimistic on the quarter. We've got an overwhelming decrease of COVID cases throughout the world. ICU and hospital capacity is improving, and the vaccine roll-up is picking up momentum.So we've also seen stronger sales of our capital equipment, especially toward the end of last summer that we noted on our quarterly call.

806,"""Medtronic now offers the first and only CE Mark approved leadless pacemaker portfolio, expanding the number of potential candidates for this groundbreaking technology throughout the world. Per the medical fraternity, with the approval of the device, more pacemaker patients will be eligible for a new treatment option. Notably, the regulatory approval is based on data from the MARVEL 2 (Micra Atrial Tracking Using A Ventricular accELerometer) study, assessing the safety and effectiveness of accelerometer-based atrial sensing algorithms.The results showed that the primary efficacy objective was met. The results were presented at the American Heart Association 2019 Scientific Sessions and published in JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology.We note that the first device from the Micra product line that received CE Mark was— Micra Transcatheter Pacing System (TPS) — the first leadless pacemaker to treat heart rhythm disorders in 2015. The following year, the same device got FDA approval.Significance of the Latest Approval and Market ProspectsThe latest device is superior to traditional pacemaker devices as it involves a minimally invasive implant procedure of a cosmetically invisible device. Even though the chances of complications with traditional devices are rare, they do involve costly and invasive surgery. However, the use of Micra has shown a substantial drop in major complications, unlike its traditional counterparts.Another advantage of Micra AV over the original Micra TPS is that it has several additional internal atrial sensing algorithms, which can detect cardiac movement. This allows the device to adjust pacing in the ventricle to coordinate with the atrium, thus, providing AV synchronous pacing therapy to patients with an AV block.The CE Mark is significant since Micra AV is the only pacemaker offering advantages of leadless pacing in Europe. Going by a 2019 Businesswire data, according to a new study by iData Research, the $2.7 billion European Cardiac Surgery Market is expected to grow 67% by 2024. Given the market potential, the approval is well-timed.""",0.9963

This is a no brainer if you're willing to incur the refi expenses which are cash expenses.

Nobody wants to see these field problems, except the PI attorneys, As with most of these, the public info comes quite a while after the problem surfaces -- this was recalled in Nov 2019. This one is relatively minor compared to the 670G recall:""Medtronic recalls StealthStation DBS softwareBy AuntMinnie.com staff writersJune 1, 2020 -- Device manufacturer Medtronic has recalled the autoregistration feature on its StealthStation DBS software used in deep brain stimulation (DBS) procedures due to inaccuracies that could lead to serious harm to patients, according to a summary published June 1 by the U.S. Food and Drug and Administration (FDA).The recall was issued due to inaccuracies caused by minor patient movements during the software's autoregistration process when used with the company's NexFrame stereotactic imaging system and O-arm imaging system during a DBS procedure. These errors may not be detected by the surgeon or the device system, according to the FDA.""This may provide inaccurate registration data which could lead surgeons to inaccurately navigate lead placement during image guided DBS procedures,"" the FDA wrote in its recall information summary. ""This could result in serious or life-threatening patient harm.""The FDA classified the action as a class I recall -- its most serious type. A total of 33 medical device reports have been received by the FDA as of June. Of these, 22 were related to device malfunction and 11 were related to injuries, the FDA said.Medtronic sent urgent medical device correction letters on August 9, 2019, to the 54 affected customers, advising physicians to weigh the benefits against the risks of fiducial-based or fiducial-less registration methods, according to the FDA. It also provided new instructions.After the O-arm autoregistration step has been completed, but before using the StealthStation DBS software with the NexFrame stereotactic system and O-arm imaging system for intraoperative navigation, customers should do the following:Assess navigational accuracy by verifying the accuracy of the registration on several known anatomical landmarks, as described in the indications for use, before using the registration for navigation.Use the StealthMerge functionality in the software, as described in the indications for use, to compare the actual location of the cannula or lead with the surgical plan.Use the planning functionality in the software, as described in the indications for use, to compare the cannula with the planned trajectory. This can be accomplished by making an additional plan along the axis of the cannula to evaluate cannula position.Medtronic has also added instructions to the label and has produced an updated training program to inform physicians of the inaccuracies that resulted in the recall. The FDA said it's continuing to work with the company to determine if additional mitigation measures are needed.""",0.7813

847,"Can't wait for the results tomorrow morning. The Zacks composite operating EPS av is $1.16, the Yahoo est if $1.17 so I guess they don't use Zacks. I expect expenses for the buildup of 670G sensor capacity, robotic surgery devices and CVG which saw a 40% YOY gain for TAVR in the US, up 30% in Europe - not sure about Asia & ME. I wager they had to push suppliers for manufacturing priority. So the margins in CVG and Diabetes may suffer but revenue should be strong. There are some good reasons to be optimistic about sales and then growing margins from continuing operations without the lower end business sold to Cardinal. I believe MDT's gross margin was about 68.5% last FY - Q3 will be the first full without the medical supplies drag on overall margin which should be 70%+ A wildcard out there is the US lawsuit over 2006 tax paid by MDT. They won in Fed court but the gov't appealed and it should be going to trial about now. I hope the gov't thought it needed to push it because of the inversion and the first judge had it right.

I don't see any reason why it would be under last year's raise since MDT has had strong cash flow and is projecting 9%-10% operating EPS growth this year. We could see $1.94 for a 15.8% lift.

872,"C&P from the Jeffereys Converence today - first section:Karen ParkhillThank you, Raj. Happy to be here.Question-and-Answer SessionQ - Rajbir DenhoyGreat. Yes. I wanted to maybe start with just exploring several issues that came up on the last earnings call, which I think was just a week before last. Seems like a long time ago, but it's just two weeks ago. Then we can transition to the pipeline and sort of other aspects of the story.Maybe at a high level, you chose not to give guidance, which a lot of companies didn't do, but you did give us some very substantial guidepost, I think, in the way to kind of model the company and think about the next 12 months. And so there was quite a few questions, though, that came out on the revenue outlook. And you gave some quantitative or qualitative guidance, I should say, around next quarter being potentially lower than the previous quarters, the first quarter being down on the fourth quarter. But also some of the commentary you gave around how different geographies were performing suggested that maybe that was a conservative outlook. And so is there anything maybe you want to add to that or kind of ground us in what you're really seeing right now?Karen ParkhillYes. No, thanks for the question, Raj. We are really encouraged by the things that we have seen in the month of May. Some recoveries, particularly across our cardio business and in the U.S. and a little bit earlier than we had initially anticipated. So we're encouraged by that, and we talked about on our earnings call some of the early and gradual recovery that we're seeing in China and in Western Europe. And that has remained. Even though 1.5 weeks has passed since our earnings call, those trends are still there.It's true that we did say that we expect our first quarter to be potentially modestly worse than our fourth quarter because of the full quarter impact. And we really didn't want to get ahead of ourselves on some of the early trends we're seeing because early trends don't necessarily make a full quarter. And we knew that we had some patient backlog for some procedures that we were seeing come back relatively quickly. But we know in certain procedures, it takes time to build up the backlog once you've gotten through that backlog. And in certain cases, we could see some strong recovery, a little bit of a dip, followed by recovery again. And so it was too early to make any broader calls than that.But clearly, we're encouraged. And if the quarter continues to play out based on the early trends that we've seen in this quarter, we'll do a little bit better than what we said. But at this stage, again, too early to call the quarter.Rajbir DenhoyNo. Completely makes sense. And you gave us a little bit on this, but in terms of the pace of the recovery and what you're seeing, other than, obviously, with daily sales volumes, which we don't want to get into that pattern of updating on that frequency, but are there other things that you're seeing, conversations with hospitals, surgery schedules building, any other anecdotes you can point to in terms of how the recovery is shaping up?Karen ParkhillYes. And clearly, you talk about daily sales. We're watching daily sales. We're watching weekly sales. But clearly, you see ups and downs in those, and so they don't necessarily make a trend. But we're encouraged by the fact that hospitals, particularly in the U.S., do want to get back to having some of our more elective procedures more quickly. They need it from their financial stability perspective. And so they're anxious to bring those back. We are prepared and anxious and ready to help them. Our sales teams are fully equipped with the right PP&E. We hope to be one of the first vendors that is back in the hospitals across the country and across the world actually because we are ready, we are prepared. We are helping our customers with protocols and standards and procedures in place. And so we're building stronger customer relationships as we come out. And we're ready to help make this recovery as fast as it can be.Rajbir DenhoyGreat. Just two more questions on the revenue side, and we can talk a little bit about the margin picture. The other kind of guidepost you gave us was that you expected the fourth quarter of this year -- of this fiscal year to be up on a 2-year stack basis, actually show positive growth, which would imply something around 25%, perhaps 30% sort of growth. So maybe just -- is that the right way to think about that? Are we looking for that level of growth in the fourth quarter of this year?Karen ParkhillOur likely scenario does indicate that. And when you think about it, it's going to be substantial growth if we're back to more normal levels off of a very low base in the prior year fourth quarter. So just given that, it needs to be high growth. And so that's why we've chosen to look at it on a stacked basis because neither year -- neither fourth quarter is normal...",0.9996

890,JP Morgan Q&A is available on MDT's site when you click on the webcast. There will be a slowdown in CVG to 1.5% - 2% for this Q3 but will come in at 3% - 3.5% for FY 19. Looks like a market shift that MDT will move with. The CFO stated that if the proposed IRS reg changes that are currently in a public comment period do go into new Regs then it could be a shift from MDT's current 15% overall tax rate up by 2% or better - could be 250 bp's or 2.5% for 2020. The CFO said new regs have been proposed over a period of months and out for comment for weeks. Should that happen then it will tamp down EPS growth from the 9% - 10% run rate to perhaps below 8% for 2020. After that Omar and Karen said it would revert back to trend at 9% - 10% EPS growth. That was the catalyst to drop MDT 6% in the early afternoon on an up day. They said they were looking for offsets. It wasn't asked but I assume that the new tax burden would apply to MDT's competitors alike. I haven't seen anything published specifically about the new IRS regs in question.,0.9758
891,possible break out at $ 96.00. end of week. then to $ 100 +.,-0.1932
892,"If the US corporate tax rate goes up 7% then MDT will see a base 7% increase on Taxable Income from the 53% of MDT revenue from the US. Since MDT has been running a 15% - 15.5% blended overall tax rate, so it will see approximately a 3.5% increase, maybe 3.6% to its overall tax rate driving it up to the 18.5% - 19% range. However, US tax based competitors will see their overall blended rates go up by 7%. The US is the only significant nation that allows a deduction from US tax for foreign tax paid but if less than the base rate then more tax is owed to the US -- if France taxes your French Taxable Income at 18% you then owe 10% to the IRS. The US has the highest corporate tax rate so it makes sense to do this. So, MDT's overall cash flows will take a hit but half the hit of many competitors leaving it with an overall tax rate of about 19% if the US goes back to the 28% level. That 9% difference is for a mature firm with taxable income around the world. Omar pushed for the COV inversion to Ireland. Now the Treasury Sect says she will push for a global minimum tax. I don't think that will happen because Ireland and many other countries would love to see big firms set up in their countries. What I think will happen is that new law will be passed which will make it very difficult if not impossible to invert. That what Sect Lew tried to do to sink the MDT/COV inversion. I am very glad the inversion is now 6 yrs old, I'll wager that Medtronic will be mentioned as a reason to pass new rules governing proposed inversions so more big fish don't get away. The 2015 inversion will allow the 9% of Taxable Income saved annually to be used for dividends and buybacks.",0.9695
