The so-called “soda tax” has led to decreases in soda consumption and is projected to save over 18,000 lives from illnesses related to excess sugar consumption over 10 years.Despite the positive effects on public health, efforts to promote healthier consumer habits have been met with resistance from the food and beverage industry. For example, the CEO of Coca Cola personally called Mexico’s president in 2013 to encourage him to oppose the soda tax, and some Mexican media companies refused to air advertising supporting the tax.

I watched that happen with WSM, FOSL, CPRI, ANF, AEO and TPR. Prices are dropped on low volumes to set up for high volume buying days that they use to load up on shares.

It annoys me when people say, ""$CRSR doesn't deserve a high valuation,"" solely on the basis of two bearish cases, 1) the e-gaming & peripherals industries are not going to continue to grow at this rate (well no s**t sherlock), and 2) the company has debt, (who doesn't), but here are my rebuttals:- The e-gaming and peripherals industry is not going to grow at 70% this year, sorry eternal and out-of-touch bulls, but I can assure you that both the e-gaming industry & Corsair revenues will grow at rates well over 10% this year. So does that mean $CRSR deserves a P/S ratio of 1.8? Well lets look at a company who's business model will be much more effected by a switch from Covid-19 lockdowns to a back-to-normal economy… - $ZM - Zoom Video Communications. $ZM is expected to post revenues of $2.6B this year, but their market cap is currently residing at $117.6B. My common sense tells me video communications are going to see the same industry decline that e-gaming will face, if not a sharper decline in overall industry revenues. So why then does ZM deserve a P/S of 55 and CRSR a P/S of 1.8? - Let's look at price-to-sales/price-to-earnings adjusted for growth and see if that hides anything... ZM has a P/S/G of 14.268, CRSR has a P/S/G of 3.826, and for all you saying CRSR isn't profitable, ZM has a P/E/G of 49.745, CRSR has a P/E/G of 5.65. Talk about undervalued, no matter how you spin it, CRSR's valuation is well below stocks in similar industries (in terms of covid-related growth), FYI you can use these metrics for every growth stock and CRSR comes out on top almost every time. - Not to mention, CRSR has a P/S ratio lower than those of legacy companies with dying revenue growth, look at $KO & $PEP. But back to the argument, CRSR is anywhere from 4-50X undervalued compared to ZM, a company who will see slower revenue growth thanks to the Covid vaccine.- $CRSR's debt-to-equity ratio, Warren Buffet's favorite indicator of a company's health, is shrinking FAST! This is great news for all you noobs out there, a DER of under 2 is considered healthy, and for a growth stock, anything under 5 is somewhat healthy, or at least normal. - Corsair has dropped its DER from over 4 to 1.37 this past quarter, if that doesn't scream FCF, I don't know what does. Not to mention large organizations like $ORCL have a current DER of over 1 but have very bulky valuation ratios. Any way you spin it, CRSR's debt is diminishing fast as CRSR grows their margins and start to rake in serious income.All around, CRSR's valuation absurdly low, I blame the share lock-up for low supply of shares (float) which converts to easy market manipulation by institutions who have tossed around shares in the company (recently % of shares held by institutions has ranged from low 20's to low 10's). When institutions hold only a small % of shares, it typically means less analyst coverage, less catalysts for the ticker to trend or boom, aka, less retail investors buying, exactly why we see extremely low average volume which in turn allows for more market manipulation. Long read, but all my opinion on current scenario, I currently see CRSR as a $100 company and have stake in said company.",0.9956

It is a lie for Coke to label their fructose soda ""original taste.""It simply does not taste the same as it used to. Coke can make their product however they want, but they should not be allowed to use deceptive advertising. By the way, who said it tastes the same? Did they actually bring people in and compare ? Maybe the people in the experiment said it tastes ""somewhat the same"", or kinda, but no one, with normal taste buds, can say its the same original taste. It can never taste the same, being in an aluminum can. Coke would have to go back to sugar cane, bottled in glass, to have the original taste.

The stock has split two times since 1994, bringing Berkshire's ownership to 400 million shares. The cost basis on those shares is $1.299 billion. At the current stock price of $51.71 per share, Berkshire's investment in Coke is worth $20.7 billion. That leaves an unrealized gain of $19.4 billion on the investment.The gains are even larger when factoring in dividends. At Coke's current quarterly payout of $0.40 per share, Berkshire's 400 million shares will bring in $640 million over the next year in dividend income.

1946,"( 10. Coca-Cola Company (KO):Dividend Yield: 3.14%Coca-Cola Company (KO) is a consistently high-performing dividend stock throughout the years. The company is known to increase its payout ratio to shareholders. Their profits continue to grow. Coca-Cola does not just offer sugary drinks that could fall in demand as healthier lifestyles increase. They offer a variety of drinks, including healthy options. Coca-Cola has built a reputation for taking care of its investors.The Georgia-based beverage giant recently announced better-than-expected financial results for the first quarter. Coca-Cola reported earnings of $2.25 billion, or 52 cents per share for the three months ended April 2, slightly below $2.78 billion, or 64 cents per share in the comparable period of 2020. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 55 cents per share, surpassing the consensus forecast of 50 cents per share.Revenue for the quarter came in at $9 billion, down 5 percent from $8.60 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts on average were expecting Coca-Cola to report revenue of $8.68 billion. The operating margin in the quarter was 30.2 percent, as compared to 27.7 percent in the same period of 2020.Speaking on the results, CEO James Quincey said in a statement, “We are encouraged by improvements in our business, especially in markets where vaccine availability is increasing and economies are opening up, and we remain confident in our full year guidance.”) Coca Cola keeps popping up as one of the Best dividend stocks to invest into in 2021 , this one is from Insider Monkey.",0.9964

This made it an impressive 59 straight years that it has increased payments.When a company reaches half a century, it becomes a Dividend King. Last year, there were only 27 companies that were on this illustrious list. While this is impressive, many companies have raised dividends for years, only for shareholders to receive an unpleasant surprise one day.Still, this is a good place to start since it shows how important the dividend is to the company, and it has raised it during very trying circumstances over the years, including recessions and a pandemic.)

He is also Founder and CEO of FibroGen, inc. A company 3 times larger then Senseonic.“I have to say I have been a long time believer in this Company and have been dumbfounded on why it has taken till now to finally be realized for its value. I am a Biomedical Scientist who helped to found FibroGen, Inc and I feel SENS has more to offer in the long run. Very important technology and an enormous market that needs this type of continuous monitoring. I was a speaker at a Juvenile Diabetes Medical Meeting in Dallas Tx in 1981 and the physicians were praying for something like the SENS technology to help Diabetics become healthier and safer. Now it is here and with future work to couple the sensors with a pump to deliver the correct amount of insulin you will have the dream that has been the Holy Grail for Diabetic Therapy for 45 years.

How ever in 2020 if you are a Shareowner of Record (meaning you hold your shares in your name through Computershare, our Registrar and Transfer Agent). You will need your 15-digit control number located on your proxy card or meeting notice. If you received your meeting notice via e-mail, your control number will be easily identified. You never have to show a picture ID to get a 15-digit control number , A voting right is the right of a shareholder of a corporation to vote on matters of corporate policy, including decisions on the makeup of the board of directors, issuing new securities, initiating corporate actions like mergers or acquisitions, approving dividends, and making substantial changes in the corporation's operations. It is common for shareholders to voice their vote by proxy by mailing in their response or by relinquishing their vote to a third party proxy voter. The number of votes a shareholder has corresponds to the number of shares they own. Thus, somebody owning more than 50% of a company's shares can effect a majority of the vote and is said to have a controlling interest in the firm.

Furthermore, Coca-Cola controls an estimated 20% of the cold-beverage market in developed countries and 10% of the cold-beverage share in faster-growing emerging markets.Aside from geographic reach and selling what might as well be a basic-need product, Coca-Cola's success is also a function of its superb marketing. It's one of the most recognized brands in the world, and it's done wonders to keep consumers engaged. Coca-Cola has holiday season tie-ins, has not been afraid to use social media to reach a new generation of consumers, and has a small army of well-known brand ambassadors.With a cost basis of just $3.25 per share, Buffett and his investing team are netting an annual yield (based on cost) of a whopping 52%.Boycott warren Buffett",0.9976

This stock and company are literally in like the bottom 5% of stocks that should be on your radar, if not lower. In this day of crypto, skyrocketing NASDAQ stocks and virtually everything going parabolic, you've chosen to hang your hat on a company that sells flavored water? And then in spite of their obscene political stands, you double down and tell us all how great they still are.This isn't the 40's. KO isn't exactly on the cutting edge anymore. They didn't even expand into snacks like their competitor did. Just flavored water. I guess since they can't even figure out how to increase earnings with the pedestrian products they sell, the next logical choice for their CEO was to dive head first into politics. Bizarre at best.

Those original 25 million shares have grown into 400 million shares - not thru major incremental purchases, nor DRIP - but by KO share splits over the past 30 years. He won't sell due to taxes. I'm thinking he's the most likely buyer of KO especially now that the shares are more than 10% DOWN from recent high. At new rate of about $1.56 dividend per year and h under 10% ownership stake, his dividend payout ( or cash flow savings/benefit, call it what you want) would go from $600 million per year to $6 billion per year - leaving the company as it is owing 100% of KO.

While these trends are mostly understood, the path forward is unclear and there are four main areas of risks for the beverage companies.The risks specific to Coca-Cola include: 1. Lower potential revenue and profit from a shift in sales away from home to take-home. 2. The Costa business is mostly store-based and represents a mid-single-digit rate of total sales. 3. Coca-Cola's bottling partners could require greater financial support. 4. Coca-Cola's debt leverage of 2.7 times 2019 net debt/EBITDA is above its mega-cap peer average of 1.5 times which limits its ability to driving shareholder value.Monster Beverage's exposure to gas stations and convenience stores is a ""significant concern"" as both end-markets account for around 70% of total sales, the analyst wrote in a note.The company is backed by a ""very strong"" balance sheet and strategic potential but shares are down just 6% since the start of 2020 (when the note was published), which warrants a cautious move to the sidelines.",0.9214

3929,"Bought KO and a smile today ! 3 Stocks That Feel Like Disney in 1957 !!!! Ever since Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) burst onto the scene with its robotic da Vinci surgical system, it has been clear that there is demand for robotic-assisted surgery. Israel-based Mazor Robotics is one of the few that have been able to follow with its own real, live-production robotic surgery system, and it appears to be just starting its own growth trajectory.Mazor Robotics' big claim to fame is that patients receiving surgery with its devices can see faster recoveries with post-operative pain and have fewer rates of complications vs. traditional operations. Just like Disney wasn't the first entertainment company out there but leveraged its high quality to grow, Mazor Robotics looks capable of leveraging those strong quality benefits to build its business over time.Speaking of that growth, in its most recently reported quarterly results, Mazor Robotics provided investors with many reasons to believe that its future looks bright. Those include:Revenue more than doubling to over $17 million;Receiving authorization to sell its Mazor X System in Europe; andGetting interim clinical data to showcase a fivefold reduction in complications and a sevenfold decrease in revision surgeries when its equipment is used vs. freehand lumbar fusion surgeries.With its revenue expanding and its losses contracting as it scales up its operations, Mazor Robotics looks like it's at the early end of its growth curve. With an in-demand industry like surgery and the clear quality benefits it brings to the table, Mazor Robotics may see growth in the future much like Disney did over the last several decades.If Walt was alive today , he would tell you to buy MZOR !!!",0.9971
