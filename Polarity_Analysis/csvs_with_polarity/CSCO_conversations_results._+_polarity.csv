20,"David Cameron believed Barack Obama, a man with whom he appeared to share a warm and respectful relationship that even verged on a so-called bromance, was one of the “most narcissistic, self-absorbed people” he ever met, according to the ex-Prime Minister’s former strategy chief.Steve Hilton, who was one of the former Premier’s closest advisers until they parted ways over his support for Brexit and tougher immigration laws, said the former president “thought he was smarter than everyone”.Discussing the fall out triggered by the publication of Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, which claims many of Donald Trump’s top aides believe he is mentally unfit to be President, Mr Hilton claimed Mr Trump was being attacked for his assault upon national and international elites.“My old boss, former British prime minister David Cameron, thought Obama was one of the most narcissistic, self-absorbed people he’d ever dealt with,” Mr Hilton said.“Obama never listened to anyone, always thought he was smarter than every expert in the room, and treated every meeting as an opportunity to lecture everyone else. This led to real-world disasters, like Syria and the rise of Isis.”He said for the world’s elites, such problems were not an issue as they existed within their own bubble.“For them, it’s all about style and tone, not substance and results. Donald Trump offends the elites aesthetically, like a piece of art that’s not to their taste,” he said.“They can afford to do that because they live in a world of booming neighbourhoods, delightful hipster eateries and everyone they know employed in the virtual world of the knowledge economy. They don’t see what’s going on in the actual economy.”",0.9686

The federal government needs more funds to ramp up its planned spending, which includes another round of massive legislation. This opens up a big opportunity for the GOP, but we’ll get to that later.Bloomberg reported this week: “Unlike the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus act, the next initiative, which is expected to be even bigger, won’t rely just on government debt as a funding source. While it’s been increasingly clear that tax hikes will be a component — Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said at least part of the next bill will have to be paid for, and pointed to higher rates — key advisers are now making preparations for a package of measures that could include an increase in both the corporate tax rate and the individual rate for high earners.”",0.9778

We have enormous, enormous costs, much of it incurred because the president was in denial early on, delayed a reaction to it, caused deaths. And so, now, we want to say, okay, that was then. Alright, let’s start now and do things in a positive way. Nobody’s putting anything on the table saying, unless we have this, we’re not doing that. He shouldn’t either.”Pelosi later declined to say whether she would accept a payroll tax cut in exchange for concessions on things Democrats want by saying she didn’t want to negotiate on TV.---------------------------------------------------------------Good for Nancy.....keep those 'middle class tax slaves' in line...why let them keep the money THEY EARNED...!!!

His childlike ignorance — preserved by a lifetime of single-minded self-promotion — concerning governance and economics guarantees that whenever he must interact with experienced and accomplished people, he is as bewildered as a kindergartener at a seminar on string theory.Which is why this fountain of self-refuting boasts (“I have a very good brain”) lies so much.

I've often compared Chuck Robbins with Satya Nadella. Has anyone forgotten how MSFT languished in the high 40's and low 50's for YEARS before Nadella? But he had SOFTWARE to work with, while Robbins has a much harder lift with HARDWARE. Software isn't nearly as costly to develop and you can sell it over and over and over for HUGE profits....Networks are expensive - very expensive - and carriers do NOT change their hardware more than absolutely necessary. So now CSCO is trying to implement changes using SAS, rather than selling new components containing new software. John Chambers had relatively little competition when he was CEO but now the list of Cisco's peers and rivals is long indeed. I know a lot of investors are frustrated with the stock - one even said that they haven't made acquisitions - seriously? I think Robbins is the right man for the job and I have faith that he will turn this company around one way or the other and get the stock price where it belongs. If you just look at the PE and compare it with some of the high fliers, the price should be three times what it is now, all things being equal.

The US is now piling on sanctions and telling the world to stop buying Iranian oil. Sooner or later it is possible, likely even, that the Iranian government will stop abiding by the agreement and start stepping up its uranium enrichment and other activities. That is likely to raise tensions in the Gulf dramatically and make other regional players rethink whether to acquire nuclear weapons themselves.Taking all these developments into consideration, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has decided to set its “doomsday clock” to two minutes to midnight, the closest to catastrophe it has been since 1953.",0.8587

Now we know why nancy pants caved!Senator Lindsey Graham has created a new reality for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.Graham has written a powerful resolution which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell joined in co-sponsoring. Together they have attracted 50 co-sponsors – which means with Vice President Pence supporting them they would win a vote to dismiss any phony impeachment from the House that failed to meet a key standard of fairness.The resolution: “calls on the House of Representatives, prior to proceeding any further with its impeachment investigation into President Trump, to vote to initiate a formal impeachment inquiry; calls on the House of Representatives to provide President Trump, like every other American, with due process, to include the ability to confront his accusers, call witnesses on his behalf, and have a basic understanding of the accusations against him that would form any basis for impeachment; and calls on the House of Representatives to provide members of the minority with the ability to participate fully in all proceedings and have equal authority to issue subpoenas and other compulsory process.”Faced with this new reality, Speaker Pelosi suddenly ended months of avoiding a vote on the impeachment process and announced today that the House would vote this week.",0.9495

CrowdStrike is a private sector security company in Silicon Valley, and they were hired by the Crooked Hillary team to keep her email server out of the hands of the FBI. James Comey saw that that mission was successfully completed. Why does President Trump mention CrowdStrike in the transcripts? Because CrowdStrike is the one, single thread that ties together Joe Biden getting slush-fund money for his son Hunter, the Russian Collusion hoax, the Mueller Report, and collusion of the Obama administration with the Russians in 2016. Yep, CrowdStrike.Yes, the Democrats know that they cannot actually impeach President Trump, just like they knew that there was no Russian Collusion. But they kept that scam going for two and a half long years anyway to tie Trump up, and in that respect, the Democrats were successful. But they did not anticipate CrowdStrike popping up in the transcripts, and now they are in an absolute panic to muzzle Trump.

The article goes on to say that shipment by rail is more expensive, slower and more dangerous.Now if I were a billionaire (like say Warren Buffett) who was the head of a multi-national corporation (like say Berkshire Hathaway) that has a railroad company in its corporation (Burlington Northern Santa Fe) I would do the following to make sure I could make A LOT of money from my railroad company…I would make a large donation to an environmental group who would slow down (or stop) development of any pipeline that would affect my railroad investment….

Many of the plants are in China, but by capacity, roughly a fifth of these new coal power stations are in other countries.Over all, 1,600 coal plants are planned or under construction in 62 countries, according to Urgewald’s tally, which uses data from the Global Coal Plant Tracker portal.

Now I am seeing Microsoft cloud service start taking over slowly most of my company's business with cisco. Teams I feel is going to be the silver bullet that takes out cisco video/voice solution. My firm is starting to move away and going for a full teams implementation which will makes the cisco ip phones and video codecs a thing of the past. COVID I feel ripped the band aid and my company has accelerated this process. I will probably be out of job once we migrate these services into the cloud in the next year or two. Pretty bummed out about it because I really like Cisco and always attended their Cisco live conference every year. I've spoken with many colleagues in the industry and Microsoft teams is def winning the war. I ended up purchasing Microsoft stock around low 200 range now. Cisco needs to innovate or do something different. Chuck doesn't seem to be the right one to lead this company at the moment. I really love working with cisco routers, switches, call managers etc. They have the tech interface done right, it's just that their leadership/vision is lacking.

He’s apparently on a flight back home to Texas right at this very moment.”“I’m sure there’s going to be a lot of media waiting, asking questions, but to, like, literally flee your home state while people are freezing to death, to go to Cancun is a very Marie Antoinette,” McCain added. “One of the worst optics I could come up with in an era where there’s been a lot of bad political optics.”",0.8977

The presence of those metals may cause discarded panels to exhibit the hazardous waste characteristic of toxicity, and thus be classified as hazardous waste under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and California’s more stringent Hazardous Waste Control Law. This classification makes it expensive and burdensome to store, handle and transport end-of-life panels for recycling or disposal under current regulations.Starting on January 1, 2021, decommissioned solar panels will be regulated like other universal wastes in California, which include batteries, electronic devices, mercury-containing equipment, lamps, cathode ray tubes, and aerosol cans. The new rule will make it less expensive and burdensome to collect, process and recycle them.-------------------------------------------------------------------read on.....The pro-solar website EnergySage writes: There are some chemicals used in the manufacturing process to prepare silicon and make the wafers for monocrystalline and polycrystalline panels. One of the most toxic chemicals created as a byproduct of this process is silicon tetrachloride. This chemical, if not handled and disposed of properly, can lead to burns on your skin, harmful air pollutants that increase lung disease, and if exposed to water can release hydrochloric acid, which is a corrosive substance bad for human and environmental health.------------------------------------------enjoy.....you SnowRooms are walking into a nightmare.....you just don't know it...",-0.8444
