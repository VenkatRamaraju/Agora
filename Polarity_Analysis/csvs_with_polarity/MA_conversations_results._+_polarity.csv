This change may open merchants up to new customers who are already flocking to digital assets,"" Mastercard said. (https://mstr.cd/3tLaPZM)Mastercard specified that not all cryptocurrencies will be supported on its network, adding that many of the hundreds of digital assets in circulation still need to tighten their compliance measures.Many cryptocurrencies have struggled to win the trust of mainstream investors and the general public due to their speculative nature and potential for money laundering.(Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru; Editing by Ramakrishnan M.)",0.9867

In early trading Thursday, the shares (ticker: MA) were down 0.6% at $255.60. The S&P 500 was up 0.2%.In a Tuesday conference call, JPMorgan (JPM) said its customers’ debit and credit-card transactions at restaurants had plunged 60%, while travel spending had nearly disappeared. That bodes poorly for Mastercard, Cantwell said in his note.

However, MA strength surprised me and I went back in for 300 shares 7 days later after it had moved up to $230! Granted not a large holding, but MA has been on a tear since January 2019 when I started watching it / buying into it.. Since then I sold some calls trying to protect my gain and lower my cost basis but covering the first call at $260, added about $5 to my cost basis to get to the June 2020 $285's that were sporting a hefty $23 premium. I could not resist. My cost basis is now @ $220 but given how strong MA has since the beginning of Mar, perhaps I will have to roll them up again even though my break even point is now ~$310. Looking for some perspective from y'all who have been in MA for some time.. It looks like MA pressure is increasing to sustain this kind of momentum. I have loved the ""short 6 mo ride up but fearful about the bottom falling out. Whisper numbers indicates a very small surprise upside from the forecasted $1.82 and a forecast PT of $310 so my thought was that there was a great deal of upside to MA already built in and I was there already with my call for the top end and bottom side protection to ~$255.

If you look at the long term chart, Mastercard just keeps going up and up. On average $120 a year, excluding this past year due to the pandemic. Mastercards posted strong numbers this morning despite world economies bieng in a lockdown for almost a year now. Mastercard is always a buy whenever it dips in share price. With a 6 Billion dollar share buy back program underway, on top of the previous 6 Billion share buybask program, Mastercard will continue to propel upwards.Next year (January 2022) Mastercard will be approx. $445/share, give or take a few dollars up or down.Online shopping has accelerated due to Covid, and with the world still using approx. 85% cash transactions, the wind is in the sails of Mastercard (and Visa) for many decades more.",0.99

1603,"Greeting Long Term Mastercard Investors.I've been a shareholder of Mastercard for approx. 12 years. I was orginally invested in Visa yet decided to switch my portfolio to Mastercard as it is growing earnings at a slightly faster pace. Both companies are superior in my opinion. I am a retail investor like the rest of the crowd on this message board and I am a firm believer in both Visa & Mastercard long term growth prospects. I know there have been several other players in the payments space, yet, most rely on the infastructure and piggy back on MA & V network backbone. The barrier to entry is enormous, thus, no company has been able to penetrate what V & MA have created in terms of a worldwide processing network, which required billions of dollars of several decades. I have learned in my 12 years of owning both V & MA that they are a buy and hold on any dip in share price. Here are some things to ponder.1. 80% of the world still uses cash for transactions 2. Online Shopping is growing at an exponential rate.3. MA & V are just getting started, based on the #1 & #24. Both companies are shareholder freindly, buying back billions of dollars of shares on an annual basis. MA had 1.4 million a few years ago (afer a 10:1 slit) now share count id down significantly, which increases share price and EPS.5. If you look at historical figures going back over 30nyears, regardless of what the economy was performing on a yearly basis, MA & V always made a profit and grew eps. Even during the great recession (08/09) and Covid (20/21) both companies reported a profit and earnings growth. 6. MA and V have spent the last year consolidating (look at the one year graph), a huge basis was formed. Now that the economy is slowly recovering, fund managers and institutions have been buying back into both companies. Remeber 90% of share volume is by institutions, not retail investors. These institutions know, that once the economy is running on all 8 cylinders, Ma & V EPS will be exploding higher. This is why they have been buying shares and driving the share price up much higher, almost on a daily basis. 7. The more hotels rooms booker (airbnb) the better MA does, The more Apple phones are sold, the better MA does (most poeple pay with a credit card for a $1000 phone). The better Amazon does in online sales, the better MA does, the more houses sold (people buying furniture) the better MA does, the list goes on and on and on......etc......MA increase in value approx. 30-40% on yearly basis. Give or take a few points.Hold on to your shares and you will rewarded in the future.Peace & Cash to the Masses",0.9983

The Valuations are impossible to justify!For how long can the US Government run this fraudulent Stock BUBBLE, while Corporate revenues are tanking, Corporate and National Debt is Astronomical, the Valuations are beyond insanity, Political polarization is at max, there are ongoing and upcoming wars, the real resources are limited, Economy is Collapsing, Competition is intense, the Stock Dilutions are at record highs, everything is getting worse, China, Russia, and many other countries are set to ditch the US Dollar as an international reserve currency. Now there are 100,000s of companies worldwide competing for $1 revenue! The US Companies that barely generate revenue of $1-2 million are trading at $50-60 Billion Market values, while in Asia, the same companies with better fundamentals, 100 times more revenues, are trading at 99% less market value! The US Company valuations DO NOT MAKE Sense at all! Why would one invest in US Stock Tulip Mania while he/she can buy the 1000 times better company share for a 99% cheaper price? The US Stock Market is a MAJOR PONZI SCHEME designed to patch fraudulent pension systems in the US temporarily! There is NO PROPER Revenue Collection by the IRS since 2016. Taxes are extremely Low, and Nobody is paying custom duties! People want more free money without working, more free checks, more capital gains, more stock hypes every day!

It is unheard to run record deficits when the economy is booming. The prudent thing to do is to pay down debt when the economy is booming, but Trump is doing the opposite.These are the fact.

2680,"@Paula - Blame Trump, not the Fed. The Treasury is flooding the market with bonds to fund Trump's deficits. This is causing bond prices to fall and interest rates to rise. In addition, Trump's tax cuts and spending are stimulating an economy with unemployment at a 49 year low. This is causing inflation, and the Fed has a mandate to raise rates when it sees a threat of inflation. Trump's tariffs are also causing inflation. If Trump did the responsible thing and cut spending and paid down debt, inflation would be lower and interest rates would be lower. This is all Trump's fault. The Fed is merely reacting to Trump's foolish fiscal stimulus when the economy is at full employment.",-0.9636
