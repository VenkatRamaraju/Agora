HD has dumped millions of RYOBI battery equipment and tools that simply fleece the HD customers with $100 failed batteries and chargers with both downtime expenses and failure after failure of ""defectively engineered battery systems"" and it appears to be an after purchase RYOBI Gold Mine. HD needs to threaten RYOBI to either honor a 24hr turnaround replacement on this dilemma that really should be taken up as a class action suit in the interest of the consumer. An example : Even the battery stock found on the HD shelves have reached such a charge rate of nearly 0 that they too reflect ""Defective"" when attempting to be charged, leading to another loss of $100 and travel and down time on the greedy RYOBI fleecing. Reviews initially reflect happy customers..... but they all later return disgruntled with the failed battery rate and the anguish of purchasing battery after battery with the same results.

HD upped it's earnings estimates for the fiscal year (ending 1/31/19) to $9.42. The TRAILING annual earnings now are $8.66 giving HD a P/E of 22.3, about 10% less than the S&P 500 avg despite a greater than avg. growth rate and 2.1% div.I have a schedule for investments in 2019 and HD is on it, but I'm considering tightening my belt for a while and advancing that investment to now.I first bought HD last year @ $153.11 when I saw the housing market recovery picking up. From my personal experiences in the stores, I planned to buy Lowe's instead of Home Depot. But after a lot of research, I saw that Home Depot, the much larger chain, had durable competitive advantages in long-term contracts with builders and with the unique ability to ship very large pre-fab and other items. Lowe's increases its earnings almost entirely by building new stores. Home Depot does it by increasing same store sales more than new stores and same store sales increased over 8% over the last year.I plan to hold HD for decades if it holds on to those advantages.",0.9952

I believe HD is expecting a slow down, as their support staff has been diminished.For the past year, HD could hide flaws and blame the pandemic (as long as they remained better than their competition). Now, their competition is improving; while HD is retracting services.If you want to see a perfect example, the BOT customer service may field extremely basic questions; it is only frustrating their customer base. Try to reach a human support on the phone - they insist you request a HD text to field basic questions (like the BOT) and promise to have someone call - but no call.Try calling to purchase product and hold product for pick-up (only offered for PRO service); HD tells you to order on line (and wait for a few days).

Total parts needed runs about 40 bucks and with one installer takes less than an hour. we charge 220 bucks for the job, while others charge 600 bucks or more, depending on what car you drive or how big your house is. we did one changeover on a double wide door one time and later, i went into the Ladies kitchen to get a check.

The parking lot was completely full and the lines were in the store stacked up behind the cash registers. Every register was open. Lows and HD report earnings May 20th or so. As everyone is aware, one of the key metrics for retail is same store sales growth. If HD keeps this policy through the end of the month of April, my guess is the YOY same quarter sales growth will be up for Lowes and down for HD.

The weight of this first-hand testimony, along with supporting government documentation and other evidence, established without any doubt the reality of these phenomena. These individuals offered to give sworn testimony to Congress about their encounters, but Congress has refused to hear them. Instead for 60 years, the government has covered up and lied to the American people about the existence of UFOs.Here is a link to the press conference, please watch and pass on!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-iaV_XW9iE",0.9917

She said that she also had to reprogram her car.

3200,"While I usually feel political posts should go elsewhere, I will make an exception. Working with the U.S. intelligence community on several projects I could not resist giving my thoughts about what has been going on in this country for quite a while. Disclaimer: I voted for neither Presidential candidate of the major parties during the 2016 election. ""Who rules America""?After forty years of observation, readings, and conversations, it's the elites via their organizations such as the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations.They are the primary drivers behind the efforts to impeach Trump. They are using their assets in the Press, the intelligence community, the media, etc. for the impeachment of Trump.They had heavily invested in getting the Clintons into power. The Trump election and the Brexit were major blows to their plans for a one world government run by their shills like the Clintons, JImmy Carter, George Bush I, etc.They cannot control Trump like the others. During the last days of the 2016 Presidential campaign, Trump ran an add in California about returning the government to the people. It briefly displayed a photo of David Rockefeller. What are their plans? See the comments below by two of their leaders: Zbigniew Brzezinski and David Rockefeller. These comments should scare anyone!For those who downplay or mock concerns about the power, dealings, pervasiveness or agenda of the shadow government, consider the following.If the recent Sixty Minutes revelation that the deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, and the assistant attorney general of the United States, Rod Rosenstein, conspired to recruit cabinet members to impeach Trump shortly after his election as well as comments by 3 FBI officials disclosing in private emails that they had a plan to deal with Trump didn't bother you, then consider these comments by two leading members of the Trilateral Commission, especially the last one by David Rockefeller citing collusion by the national Press to keep the shadow government from the public:“The technotronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite, unrestrained by traditional values. Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files containing even the most personal information about the citizen. These files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities""-Zbigniew Brzezinski, Between Two Ages: America's Role in the Technetronic Era""This regionalization is in keeping with the Tri-Lateral Plan which calls for a gradual convergence of East and West, ultimately leading toward the goal of one world government”-Zbigniew Brzezinski""Shortly, the public will be unable to reason or think for themselves. They'll only be able to parrot the information they've been given on the previous night's news""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""People, governments and economies of all nations must serve the needs of multinational banks and corporations""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""The society will be dominated by an elite of persons free from traditional values who will have no doubt in fulfilling their objectives by means of purged techniques with which they will influence the behavior of people and will control and watch the society in all details. It will become possible to exert a practically permanent watch on each citizen of the world""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""The nation state as a fundamental unit of man's organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force: International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation-state""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure - one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.""-David Rockefeller""We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a World Government.The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past centuries""-David RockefellerIMHO-The elites want Trump impeached, because unlike Jimmy Carter, George Bush I, the Clintons, etc., they cannot control him and he is a threat to their plans.We have met the primary enemy and they is us!",0.9933

Decor-oriented products comprise nearly 25% of sales, certainly a substantial amount. However, decor products alone only made up about 3% of total sales. With the acquisition of The Company Store, Home Depot is making a move into the softer side of things, attracting a new type of customer. Furthermore, the fragmentation in the home goods market gives HD with consolidation potential, allowing them to steal market share from larger players in the game such as Home Goods (TJX), Wayfair (W), and even Target (TGT).

4075,"At least analysts are defending the stock.....I've seen what happens when they turn against a stock. Pretty confident of a rebound next two weeksWall Street by and large came out quickly to defend Home Depot’s stock, long a top play for many strategists. Some have reasoned Home Depot will continue to benefit from favorable dynamics in the housing market, ranging from low interest rates spurring remodeling activity to a pick up in building activity in 2020.“The macro nature of their business is in better shape,” Gradient Investments portfolio manager Jeremy Bryan said on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade. Gradient owns Home Depot shares.To Bryan’s point, U.S. housing starts rebounded in October and housing permits rose to a more than 12-year high, the U.S. Commerce Department said Tuesday.Others remain bullish on Home Depot’s longer term execution and how it’s doing well in the age of digital shopping.“We expect some weakness in HD today, given the underwhelming results and likely downward estimate revisions. That said, with HD viewed as among the highest-quality names and with some macro tailwinds, we think the downside damage to the stock could be mitigated,” Nomura Instinet analyst Michael Baker wrote in a note to clients.Baker’s bullishness was echoed by Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski.“3Q comp sales were light, though operating margins in-line with expectations. We believe shares down in the pre-market create a buying opportunity, as we interpret lighter 2H results to be more tied to timing of returns on strategic investments vs. a softer macro picture. These results don't change our view of a favorable industry backdrop with ongoing home improvement center share gains across most categories,” Matuszewski said.",0.9952

4141,"My dad bought Home Depot around late 80's/early 90's and has held ever since. He has always told me what a great company it is and how he was amazed the very first time he went in one. When i was a kid he proudly showed me the shareholder annual reports which showed a thriving company. And he talks about how many employee millionaires the company has printed. And the story of HD founders. Lowe's, despite its success, has never been a favorite of my dad, he always says their service is the worst even though sometimes they do have what he needs. I remember back when Nardelli ran HD into the ground and my dad was not happy at all, but he held his shares through it all. That time is long gone now. Nowadays, my dad says all the baby boomers renovating their homes and the long term endless need for more homes in this country means HD will continue to thrive for many years to come. We also talk nowadays about how resilient HD is, being mostly immune to the Amazon threat in a changing retail landscape. The company is also doing well at ecommerce and has a strong contractor/commercial business. Interestingly, HD and Lowe's today are pretty much it when it comes to this sector, yet the regulators don't seem to mind it being a bit of a duopoly. As i am now old enough to have real money of my own to invest, and i continue to build out my own long term portfolio of individual stocks, i will soon be a shareholder too. Yes, it has run up a lot in recent years and it goes down in recessions when the market goes down but this is one of the great American success stories.

At the same time it seems STUPID to me not to pay off the long term debt and short term debt and to make some appropriate investments. I'm impressed to see internet sales up 24% to a total of 6% of sales. Earnings is 3.6% if you multiply $1.69 x 4 and divide by the $187 or so price of the stock to annualize the earnings, not much to brag about, but not bad, but doesn't justify the massive PE. They are trying hard to PUSH the price up, it seems. Pay off the debt, sock away $10B, get ready for the recession, get ready to deal with inflation. The short term thinking isn't very impressive. I think they need a new CEO. It goes back to the 3.6% annualized earnings, not so hot. Something in the numbers seems weird. 3.6% earnings when you annualize it, but same store sales up 7.5%. Please tell me that's not inflation's real number. They did come out with some numbers recently for the month that if you take the month and multiply by 12 is around 6%. Of course, they said the numbers go up and down, but what if it's real?seriously, $$1.69 x 4 / $187 = .036, that is 3.6% return, which is a PE of 27.7revenue is up 6.86%, why is earnings only 3.6%?I think a company has to pay off their debt (like a country should) and let the share price do what it does, let it dive.

I went to your site to see if I can get it at the store. Then there are the installers. They hire the cheapest labor they can get to come into your home and screw stuff up and they do a lousy job on the install. Years ago, had carpet installed. After they left, my bedroom door closes all by itself, it never did that before. It must be related to the big BOOM, I heard during the install. And, my freshly painted baseboards now need another coat. Fast forward to today. My carpet has ridges in it due the carpet not being stretched at installation. I have older carpet in the living room that lays flat on the floor. My house needs, carpet, window treatments, patio doors, new hot water heater, etc. The list goes on and on but I won't do anything until I have to because Home Depot sucks. And in case your wondering, the others suck too. These days, it's all about screw the customer and treat them like criminals, they don't deserve no better. And finally, at checkout, I always have to choose if I want and email receipt and/or printed. The reason is so HD can spam me with offers at mt email address. What genius thought of this?

The reason why it dropped to 2.08 is as follow:""It's to support its associates during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company took the following actions:Expanded paid time off for all hourly associates with additional hours that can be used at their discretion and will be paid out at year-end if not used;Provided additional paid time off for associates who are 65 and older or deemed to be at higher risk according to CDC guidelines;Provided weekly bonuses for hourly associates in our stores and distribution centers, and doubled overtime pay; andExtended dependent care benefits and waived related co-pays.As a result of the actions taken to support our associates, the Company incurred a total of approximately $850 million of pre-tax expense, or approximately $640 million after tax, equaling $0.60 per diluted share.""==> Actual earning should be 2.68.The provision would be reversed at year end so long term stock.

In its place, they are giving each employee an extra $1 per hour, but here's the kicker, they are not giving raises in 2021, so the people will have to wait until 2022.
