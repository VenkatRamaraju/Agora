67,"of the 4 major telecoms VZ, TMUS, and sprint can be considered as more purebred telecoms. by that i mean their source of income is derived primarily from the telecommunications industry. with the closing of the merger ATT is morphing into more of an ""internet of things"" company. 30% of its revenue and earnings now derive from the merged partner time warner and that % should increase even further as ATT competes in the ad space market with facebook and google. ad space on the internet and premium content both have far better growth prospects than the traditional telecom industry whose growth is pretty much limited to the population growth rate the result will be a stock that is 70% cash cow and 30% growth stock.....perhaps moving to a 60/40 ratio eventually. i think the reason some big investors want to get out of ATT is because it is now a one of a kind stock and not a pure representative of the telecom industry. it just doesnt fit into their spreadsheet even though they did the right thing with the merger. if you have money you have to spend it....put it to work. if ATT can draw down debt, realize synergies and expand access into its new high profit margin markets its a 50 dollar stock. easy.",0.9962

None of the carriers can do without 3 GHz spectrum.”Recon Analytics principal Roger Entner said that if AT&T needed to incur more debt, “now is the time to go into debt, especially for spectrum they really need and with interest rates so ridiculously low.”Entner said that based on disclosures in its most recent earnings call, AT&T’s entire debt portfolio is currently subject to interest of around 4%, after the company refinanced a lot of its debt to take advantage of historically low interest rates. He also thinks AT&T might turn its Bank of America loan into a bond sometime during 2021. “This is like a bridge loan,” said Enter. “I wouldn’t be surprised if AT&T turned this $14.7 billion loan into a 30-year note.”""https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/at-t-secures-14-7b-loan-probably-for-c-band""",0.9575

It has a $34 price target for AT&T (15.5% upside implied).J.P. Morgan expects some improving wireless subscriber trends at AT&T alongside increased retention spending.

465,"Interesting results from my survey. Three times I asked for a Thumbs UP if you think T will continue to move up from here and Thumbs DOWN if you think it will start dropping back again.The first time I asked the question was yesterday when T was up .70. I got 15 Thumbs UP and 9 Thumbs DOWN. The second time was yesterday as the stock was dropping. I still got 18 Thumbs UP and 8 Thumbs DOWN. The third time was today as the stock was continuing to drop. I got 3 Thumbs UP and 8 Thumbs DOWN.It was obvious (at least to me) that T was only up yesterday in sympathy with VZ which was up strongly because Buffett had taken a big position in VZ. Yesterday I posted that if it wasn't for VZ, T would probably done nothing (as usual). But the ultra bullish longs here, who see every up move as a possible breakout to $40 no matter what the reason, thought otherwise and strongly voted that T would continue to move higher. Later as the stock was dropping, they continued to strongly vote that T would continue to move up. Today, after a very weak close yesterday and after a quick and fairly good sized drop this morning, they suddenly changed their mind and voted strongly for a reversal in thinking and a drop back in the stock to $29.To me, this shows the general mentality of this board. Way too optimistic at the slightest sign of a green day and a general confusion in thinking when T turns red again. I don't think many here have the capacity to understand how, why or what it takes to move a stock in either direction at any particular point in time. Further, most here are more inclined to form an opinion based on emotions alone rather than thinking through things and forming a more logical conclusion. But there's still hope. Take the time to learn what you're doing rather than just jumping to conclusions based on your ""feelings"" and you'll be a lot more successful. Just my opinion.",0.9948

As areminder, we cut our fair value estimates on Verizon and AT&T on Dec. 23 as auction bidding reachednosebleed levels. Fortunately, activity cooled shortly thereafter. Actual results weren’t wildly differentthan our guesses, but carrier spending was higher than we’d hoped. Verizon spent $45.5 billion versusthe $37.5 billion we’d penciled in while AT&T shelled out $23.4 billion versus our $22.5 billion projectionwith the actual amounts likely to end up $4-8 billion higher after paying to relocate existing spectrumholders. We hadn’t expected T-Mobile to participate extensively, but it still ended up spending $9.3billion, more than double our estimate.However, the three carriers also ended up with more spectrum than we’d expected as Dish Networkwon virtually nothing and cable companies Comcast and Charter (bidding jointly) didn’t win anything.U.S. Cellular and private equity firm Grain Management each spent around $1 billion, but the big threestill ended up with more than 95% of the spectrum on offer. Holding more spectrum should reducecapital spending needs, all else equal, while keeping spectrum out of the hands of upstarts shouldcontribute to competitive rationality among the three firms. Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T plan to holdanalyst meetings on successive days March 10-12. The firms will undoubtedly extol their network We don’t expect to materially change our fair value estimates or economic moat ratings as a result ofthe C-band auction. We currently view AT&T ($36 fair value estimate) as the most attractive of the threewireless carriers. We believe Verizon is roughly fairly valued ($57) and T-Mobile is modestly overvalued($108).

Since muting someone has such a limited overall effect on the offender, I don’t recommend it because it’s comparable to witnessing a crime and responding by closing your eyes. Not very helpful. What I would recommend is to report the offender. Under the report abuse option, (the three dots to the right of you post), you have the option of being more specific with your objections. For example, you can choose to identify the offending post as an; Inappropriate post, Does not belong here post, Looks like spam post, Copyright violation post, or Something else. Under the “something else” heading, you get to put in your own words the nature of your complaint. If someone posts something truly offence, threatening or incendiary, then it’s best for everyone that you report the offending post and not just mute it. Lots of sick people out there.

1299,"There is a real disconnect going on. Apple stock is priced at a PE of 23:1 and staying high, yet everyone is talking about no one paying their cell phone bill. Either some stocks are going to get hammered soon or the idea of an economic depression is overdone. I'm not saying T is in the best debt position at this point, but the dividend should be safe for 6 months unless this gets really bad in which case the Dow will be at 10,000 and portfolios will be crushed. There is no way Apple will sell even 300M Iphones if people aren't paying their cell phone bill. Yet I don't see that kind of reaction in those stocks. Most tech stocks, even consumer tech, is holding up better than the general market. But, people will be far more likely to pay a cell phone bill than to buy a new cell phone. So at this point, the sell-off in T is an over reaction in comparison to other stocks, but that doesn't guarantee anything. Maybe their sell-off is coming if the consumer suffers for longer than a few months. The question is more basic. Will governments continue down this path even in the face of massive unemployment? I thought the objective was curve flattening, not avoiding every case. So you would think in a few weeks that we would return to normal, whatever that normal is. At that point, it's on each person to decide their own risk tolerance. But I know Americans and we are risk-takers in general, so I doubt we suffer a depression and have bread lines. It will be more likely that anyone over 65 stays home and the rest of society carries on and some take more chances than others. So T will be fine and although a little bruised, will be paying the same dividend they always pay.",-0.7891

1307,"Morningstar finds 'T' attractive:Analyst Note Michael Hodel, CFA, Director, 27 Jan 2021""AT&T’s fourth-quarter financial results weren’t great, but the firm is making progress in several areas,notably postpaid wireless and HBO Max. As with Verizon yesterday, AT&T’s inability to discuss the Cband spectrum auction is frustrating. Management cryptically promised to provide revised debt leverage targets after the auction concludes. While we don’t harbor concerns about AT&T’s balance sheet at this point, this uncertainty is not welcome, given the attention investors have paid to the debt load. AT&T ended 2020 with about $10 billion in cash and also reportedly lined up more than $10 billion in available credit earlier this month. As of now, we are sticking with our estimate that AT&T will spend around $20 billion for additional spectrum. Our fair value estimate remains $36, and we believe the stock is attractive. Postpaid net phone customer additions at AT&T (800,000 versus 279,000 at Verizon and 824,000 at TMobile) were impressive for the second consecutive quarter, likely reflecting relatively aggressive phone promotions. Management again made the case for this activity, highlighting its desire to strengthen relationships with existing customers. The percentage of AT&T customers upgrading phones was the highest in three years, and we estimate the carrier has closed the gap with Verizon in terms of customers using newer devices. But this effort has come at a cost: Phone and commission expenses pulled wireless segment EBITDA down 6% year over year despite 0.5% services revenue growth. We expect AT&T will be able to dial back promotions as 2021 progresses, though it indicated it hopes to continue driving customer growth. At Warner, the firm ended 2020 with nearly 42 million U.S. HBO Max subscribers, up 3.5 million during the quarter. The premier of Wonder Woman 1984 clearly had the desired effect on customer interest.HBO and a strong ad market couldn’t offset weak studio results, however, with total WarnerMedia revenue down 10% year over year"".",0.9983

Here is why: The P/E ratio is 6.7 with a forward P/E ratio of 9.24. As of 3/25/18, the average P/E ratio for the S&P was 23.6. This to me represents deep, deep value. Also, the payout ratio is only 41.39%. This indicates a sustainable dividend. The average dividend yield on the S&P 500 as of 3/25/18 was 1.99%. T at $32.00 is 6.25%. If T is down 10% in one year from now, which I think is highly unlikely, you will only lose 3.75% on your investment because of the dividend. However, there are many more reasons for it to go much, much higher from here.

1490,"Thanks titus......but even Warren Buffett makes mistakes- and owns up to them....like his IBM bet, among others.If T was just a cell phone company, like TMUS- I'd be more concerned than I am in owning this right now- but I have to believe that their diversification into the media world- and in companies that are showing profits- will eventually prove profitable for us shareholders when we do sell our shares. But for now- many on here are happy to live off the attractive dividend it has been paying- which it does have earnings to do so, and can well afford to.I don't see any chance of a dividend cut- which keeps a floor under this......unless people give up their cell phones- and stop watching Direct TV and cable (HBO, CNN, etc.)None of us have crystal balls- and we do know that the big fund managers run the markets with their programmed trades and algorithms. All we can hope is that companies that are profitable- in markets where there is a need- are worthy of our invest-able dollars. Some posts on boards like this can scare the %&*# out of some people, when stocks are going south- myself included-but I find that in stepping back- letting the gamblers do their thing- and just remembering that I am in this for years- not days- and that the stock isn't going down due to the company losing money- or being in a declining industry- is often the best, and calming thing to do. I admit to watching this too closely- like many do.....because I do have probably too much of my future retirement dollars in it-but I like the direction they are going. Let's see if I can stop watching this so closely- I doubt I can....it's just human nature to be concerned about your money. And let's hope the merger announcement comes sooner than later.

Netflix knew they had to catch up to its impending competitors' deep content libraries, and they will continue to rely on original productions to maintain subscribers.The global pandemic was both a blessing and a curse for Netflix. The enterprise was forced to shut down all production in North America until it is deemed safe to launch again (very uncertain timeline). Netflix's pipeline of new content is drying up, and many subscribers have watched everything (worth watching) on the platform.Disney, NBCUniversal, and WarnerMedia have decades of original video content at their disposal and do not need to rely on new productions nearly as much as Netflix. These three media giants could sit on their enormous libraries for years and still keep viewers entertained.

At age 66 at this juncture I am just looking for basically a portfolio of high dividend paying stocks where management makes paying dividends a high priority. The banks currently are giving me almost zero incentive in keeping monies there. I cant retire comfortably on a 4/10ths of one per cent CD or money market fund. As far as the bashing of CNN; I would assume CNN produces a significant operating income for T; every time I put on CNN I see a commercial within minutes. I recall when BP had that terrible oil spill everyone cried they would never buy BP gasoline again. How long did that last. IMHO HBO MAX will be the key driver for 2021.,0.9707

1701,"WHY BUY SENS NOW!From Healthcare providers who implant Dexcom, Abbott and Eversensedaily.""I have been reading these posts for about a year and think it might be helpful to weigh in. I am a Nurse Practitioner and a Diabetes Specialist. I have placed several of the 3 month Eversense sensors in the past and am a stock holder. I bought it a few years ago when I was being detailed on the technology knowing it would be a game changer. (I also bought in early to Dexcom and Tandem). Patients love this technology and were quite upset when the sales force was pulled due to Covid. It was really starting to catch on. Patients were asking for it and more insurers were covering it. The technology absolutely works and patients much appreciated the autonomy. Sensors are cumbersome and have to be changed about every 10 days. Some fail or dislodge. Eversense is a game changer. My only hesitation (and for my colleagues as well) was the 90 day insertion period. It is a surgical insertion and the site locations are limited. Many of us wanted to wait to push until a 180 day sensor was available in order to limit number of insertions per year and risk of scar tissue over time for longer term users. Insertion, however, is easy to do and was starting to be reimbursed.I do think that Eversense will end up with a pump partner for a closed loop system. IMO, Tandem makes the most user friendly pump and is paired with Dexcom. It is the best functioning set on the market. Medtronic led with the first closed loop system, but their pump is cumbersome and their sensors have always lacked accuracy issues. The new Omni pod is interesting. They have accuracy issues in the past, that they seem to be resolving with their new pump. They are the only tubeless pump and might be a good partner for the Eversense. So would the Tandem pump.Anyway, I agree with those who think that this stock is a long term hold and will substantially increase in the next few years. The product just works.",0.9936

The analyst left recent management meetings and the company's analyst meeting with a better understanding of expectations around organic growth as well as how AT&T plans to de-lever the business using organic free cash flow and asset sales. Further, Cusick believes weakening video trends are now embedded in consensus expectations.

The company also does not plan to repurchase shares during this period. 2021 guidance, announced in January 2021, remains unchanged. Revenue growth - 1% range. EPS to be stable with 2020. Capital Investment - $21B, FCF = $26B.So basically no growth in 2021! Also, seems to me that if the FCF is going to remain at $26B, with a $14 Dividend and with $21B committed to additional Capital Investments, the current Cash balance is going to start to suffer. $14B = $21B is $9B more than the $26B FCF.

Further, management's outlook for a doubling of HBO/HBO Max subs (to 120mn+) by 2025 is expected to yield EBITDA losses at HBO during this period, while investments in C-Band and fiber deployment will likely keep capex elevated.",0.9567

Very important technology and an enormous market that needs this type of continuous monitoring. I was a speaker at a Juvenile Diabetes Medical Meeting in Dallas Tx in 1981 and the physicians were praying for something like the SENS technology to help Diabetics become healthier and safer.

2802,"AT&T Inc.AT&T (T) is America's largest telecommunications company by market cap, with only Verizon (VZ) representing a competitor of similar size.T's current corporate structure stems from an intricate array of mergers since the old Bell System's 1984, but today's version of AT&T has increased its dividend for 33 consecutive years. Still, T's valuation has declined recently due to two factors.The first is rising U.S. interest rates. With a dividend yield above 6% and a very recession-resistant business model, income investors often use AT&T as a higher- yielding bond substitute. But as 10-year U.S. Treasury yields have climbed to around 3%, some investors have been selling AT&T stock in favor of lower-yielding (but safer) fixed-income instruments.Meanwhile, AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner faced a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit that T only recently won. However, the merger has now gone through, and we believe this should catalyze AT&T's share price to go higher in coming months.But for now, the stock remains relatively cheap. AT&T should deliver $3.45 of fiscal- 2018 earnings per share, which implies just a 9.4 price-to-earnings ratio. For context, AT&T's 10-year average P/E has been 13.4.So, valuation expansion going forward should be a meaningful contributor to this stock's future total returns.",0.994

But since President Biden took office, they've averaged only 1.6 million primetime viewers through March 15.CNN’s viewership during the 8-11 p.m. ET slot dropped 36% since Biden moved into the White House.

So, my question is what is going to happen to Turner (and DirecTV) over that time frame? What will happen to the movie business? Are they still going to be giving away free movies with HBO Max? I don't know about other people, but I have HBO Max. Which means I have no intention of paying for movie tickets when I can watch it at home for no extra cost.Then we have to look at the competition. Both TMUS and VZ have superior spectrum positions and may be able to sell fixed broadband internet nationally while AT&T will be restricted to a small footprint if they stick with fiber. Someone is going to be on the wrong side of that equation. Either VZ and TMUS are wrong or AT&T is wrong. Both VZ and TMUS are predicting growth to come from adding fixed wireless broadband.

2902,"**** HERE IS WHAT HBO MAX MEANS IN NUMBERS FROM ARTICLE*** HBOMAX could add an additional 50 mil global subscribers within three years, which would drive significant growth in T’s earnings stream. I estimate that 50 mil additional subscribers paying $14.99 per month would add $0.76 to T’s EPS, and 24% above FY20 consensus estimated EPS of $3.18. Additionally, I believe that T will enjoy significant margin expansion as they move their content to HBOM, because T will gain the economics of their network and cable distributors as they are disintermediated, which I have not factored into my numbers. The $0.76 in additional EPS could be worth $19+ per T share, assuming this EPS stream gets a 25x P/E multiple, which may be conservation given the growth profile. Furthermore, I think the 50 mil add estimate could be conservative based on all the recent positive developments at HBOM. As reference, the HBO platform currently has around 57 mil global subscribers, although HBOM has only launch in the US thus far. As comparison, Disney+ and Netflix have global subscriptions of 86.8 mil and 195 mil. On December 10th, Disney+ reported subscriber additions of 13.1 mil subs since October 3rd, and estimated they would be at 230-260 mil subscribers by 2024, both numbers were significantly above expectations.

It also agreed to a firewall between the two. That agreement, which was intended to prevent a full integration of the companies if the government wins its appeal, expires Thursday, Bloomberg noted.Because the appeals court issues its opinions on Tuesday and Friday mornings, it would have to rule Tuesday on the Justice Department's appeal before AT&T can end the separation agreement and proceed with the integration, according to Bloomberg.",0.9965

But we expect to hit this year, and we may hit earlier this year, our 2.5, but we will hit that. We will see -- live up to the commitment, we're going to do the show-me on what we've said about that. So that's the first priority.But once you're there, then you have to go through the normal evaluation of cash cost of equity, cash cost of debt, what -- where is your stock price at, what's the value of it, where you think your value is, what's the best answer for your shareholders. And so we'll do that in normal course. We've done this before. We'll go through that same process. We will get down to the 2.5 range just like we told you. We're going to live up to that.

3220,"Yield curve inversion -- yada yada yada. Over-hyped issue, chill. This inversion started back in March, why all the attention now when the alleged recession doesn't occur for some 18 to 24 months after the event? Govt. stats say no inflation in sight as far as anyone can see, NEC director Larry Kudlow points this out in virtually every interview he's done over the past year. Experts like to quote the history of these inversions ""over the past 50 years"" and how they foreshadowed significant recessions. One problem: this only happened on just SIX occasions over the past 50 years -- ALL OF WHICH HAVE OCCURRED SINCE 1989. To me, this raises about the statistical accuracy when all your data points are skewed towards one end of the chart.Why has this been happening since 1989, why not during the recessions of the 60's & 70's? I can answer that in two words: ALAN GREENSPAN. He chaired the Federal Reserve from 1987 through 2006. He was followed by Ben Bernanke 2006 - 20014 (Remember ""helicopter"" Ben?). Both were notorious for manipulating interest rates and so-called ""quantitative easy"" [i.e., throwing money at banks]. The primary culprit of these inversions has ALWAYS been the Federal Reserve.These inversions happen here in the U.S. largely because of the Fed's incessant need to tinker with interest rates.",-0.58

All the talk about if T had so and so's multiple or if T was Disney or Netflix, yada yada, T would be this or that, but it's NOT. T is T and the fact is that the market doesn't see T as a growth stock like it does the other companies on the list. T is a dividend stock and that's it. My guess is that it's going to be a $30 stock for as long as T stays in business.

3407,"After a stock goes X dividend, the price of the stock will decline by the amount of the dividend. That's almost a given. What happens after that is a reflection of market conditions at that time. In the case of T, price usually goes further down, to the $28 level or so, before leveling off. Eventually, it will make a run to about 30-dollar area again before retreating once more. T is considered dead money to many investors, but that’s because they don’t know how to trade the stock. If you are here to make a quick buck, then sticking around for the dividend was the wrong more. The right move would have been to buy into T several weeks before the X dividend date, take advantage of the ride up, and sold before that date. If you bought in for the dividend, then wait for the price to go back up to your entry point before selling. You might have to wait a bit and watch your investment decline to uncomfortable levels, but T’s price will eventually go back up as long as you got in under $30. Depending on market conditions, wait a week or two and you should be able to recover your investment along with the dividend. It’s not a guarantee, but so far it has worked for me. Also, T is in a long-term decline. Unless things turn around, try to get into T below $30 for the next dividend payment.",0.9885

3783,"Latest from Morningstar: 'T wants customers' :""AT&T Wants Customers: Analyst Day Highlights Focus onStability; Shares AttractiveAnalyst Note Michael Hodel, CFA, Director, 12 Mar 2021AT&T wrapped up the U.S. wireless carrier proceedings, holding its analyst day following Verizon and TMobile earlier in the week. Unlike its peers, AT&T declined to provide concrete longer-term financialforecasts. The firm instead outlined its expectations in broad strokes, with one exception: debt leverage.AT&T put stability and growth at the center of its messaging to investors, emphasizing the investmentsit is making in 5G, fiber, and HBO Max as foundations for the business. We continue to like the movesnew CEO John Stankey has made thus far. We don’t plan to change our $36 fair value estimate, and webelieve the shares are attractive.Management expects to end the year with net debt at 3.0 times EBITDA, up from 2.7 at the end of 2020and with net leverage declining to 2.5 times EBITDA or lower in 2024. While AT&T does have a higherdividend payout ratio than Verizon or T-Mobile, all three firms now have similar leverage metrics and areat least hinting at large shareholder returns in the coming years. AT&T also has the most diversebusiness mix of the three. We continue to view AT&T’s balance sheet as a strategic limitation (it wouldbe nice to repurchase shares at the current dividend yield) but not a significant threat to its viability.Stankey took the opportunity to address differences between his approach and that of his predecessor.He directly conceded that AT&T has been underinvesting in important areas, including efforts to retainand attract wireless customers. Stankey views establishing and growing customer relationships as the top priority for 2021, which will require investment in networks and content along with additionalmarketing efforts. Both Verizon and T-Mobile used their analyst days to strongly hint that wirelesspricing won’t change much over the next couple of years. While we’re disappointed that the industryisn’t showing pricing power, we’re at least hopeful that AT&T’s drive for customer growth won’t ignite aprice war"".",0.9933

I had hopes otherwise, but it seems every time we take a step forward we take another step back. It's like management has actively decided to be the worst or just next to it in every industry they get us in. I was hoping for an entire divesture of DTV, but we got a measly $7B back out of the $67B invested. Debt is crippling this company from growth and now we just went and took out even more debt to be in the 5G auction. VZ made double the investment in 5G that we just did so they will easily be the industry leader in 5G taking market share from At&t. I first looked at At&t's multiple streams of income as a way to be diversified. However they are arent a leader in any of the industries they are in. There is no focus. Slow to no growth Telecom, confusing/ chaotic media provider (HBO go, HBO Max, At&tNow, DirecTV, Uverse), content creator (don't even want to see how bad they mess up warnermedia) I'm sure any income they get from warner media will be squandered away to pay for past mistakes and playing catch up in 5G.

Where are they getting the $$ to cover their short positions? Selling from other long positions, if they have no money on the sidelines. And, if they have money on the sidelines, they are not putting new money to work in T at the moment.

AT&T (known as Southwestern Bell/SBC Corporation before 2005) raised its dividend annually for 33 straight years.AT&T expects its adjusted EPS to hit the ""upper end of the $3.50 range"" this year, which would represent at least 15% growth from the previous year. The company currently pays a $0.50 quarterly dividend, which equals $2.00 per share for the full year -- which should be easily covered by its earnings.AT&T noted that its free cash flow (FCF) rose 17% annually to $6.5 billion during the quarter, and it expects to finish the year with FCF ""at the high end of the $21 billion range."" That should give AT&T, which spent $12 billion on dividend payments in fiscal 2017, plenty of room to raise its dividend and pay off its long-term debt.",0.9606

Then to the loyalty department and was finally to they could give me the $40 monthly but would have to downgrade me to 6mbps. That was that.

Increasing the payout isn't off the table either. As long as management raises the dividend by the fourth quarter the streak of consecutive yearly increases will grow to 37 years, maintaining its status as a Dividend Aristocrat. If management can stay on plan, the payout will likely rise and the stock is a buy at the current price.",0.9677

Another reason i presume you're naked is you don't talk about how your stock got called away or got put to you. So you're always right?? Lastly, if you are naked, you should talk about the likely very small positions you're taking since they're tying up so much buying power in your account.

4526,"Argus maintains a $38pt and expects a dividend increase later this year. Synopsis follows:ARGUS RATING: BUY• Reaffirming BUY and $38 target• As expected, the pandemic weighed heavily on AT&T's 4Q results, especially in the WarnerMedia andVideo divisions.• However, the core wireless services business continued to show resilience as work-at-homerestrictions have made communication services and connectivity more vital than ever.• The 4Q20 launch of the iPhone 12 may spur increased competition in the wireless industry, thoughconsumers may still be reluctant to switch carriers due to the pandemic.• We are lowering our 2021 EPS estimate to $3.19 from $3.27 and setting a 2022 forecast of $3.25.INVESTMENT THESIS We are maintaining our BUY rating on AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) to a target price of $38. The COVID-19 pandemic had multiple negative impacts on AT&T's business in 4Q20,especially on the WarnerMedia and Entertainment divisions. However, the core wirelessservices business continued to show resilience as the pandemic and follow-onwork-at-home restrictions have made communication services and connectivity more vitalthan ever. Based on management's comments, we expect AT&T to face continued revenue andprofit pressure from the pandemic in 2021. While these effects may tail off over time, thefuture is highly uncertain - as reflected in management's weak 2021 guidance. Still, AT&Tcan rely on its strong balance sheet and prudent management as strengths in the currentenvironment. The 4Q20 launch of the iPhone 12 may spur increased competition in thewireless industry, and AT&T has offered an attractive promotion to boost iPhone 12upgrades. Nevertheless, consumers may be reluctant to switch carriers until the pandemicrecedes. AT&T trades at a modest forward valuation premium to peers and at the low end ofthe historical range.",0.9727

The firm delivered solid wireless results during the second quarter, while Game of Thrones provided a lift at WarnerMedia’s HBO unit, which has struggled to grow amid a carriage dispute with Dish Network. The troubled entertainment segment again outperformed our expectations, balancing pricing and expenses better than we thought possible, contributing to profit growth. Consolidated cash flow was also again strong, enabling another quarter of significant debt reduction. Management increased its 2019 free cash flow projection to $28 billion from $26 billion. This increase was based primarily on the sale of WarnerMedia receivables, rather than any major change in the business, which appears to reflect management’s desire to begin repurchasing shares as soon as possible.

They IPO'ed Chipolte and held all the millions of shares as it skyrocketed once detached from the hated parent company. T has too many haters, but HBO is a well liked brand with a history of some of the best shows ever made by a non-broadcast network. They can keep the partnerships and free HBO for Cell subscribers and even better - pay a fee for them. T revenue doesn't go anywhere, but HBO revenue grows like crazy.

Speaking to CNBC, Stephenson reiterates AT&T should generate $26B in free cash flow this year, leaving $12B for debt reduction after the company shells out $14B in dividends. He says there's another $6B-$8B in the pipeline from asset sales. Add that to the $9B it repaid last year, and AT&T will have repaid 75% of the Time Warner debt by the end of 2019, Stephenson tells CNBC.

The charts person he quoted said “T was a great buy because of the chart indicated a buy low senecio”... because timeline is hard to do when it comes to buy low sell high........ However it Never did do much.... I think it is was $37.00 or so during the episode....... and that was a buy point based off the historical charting of the lows...As for Verizon, it did start a down trend towards the end of 2020... So its very easy to call the ball on VZ going up...However Buying T under $30 is very smart and Cramer should be pumping it now... but Cramer will not pump T again until it’s above $35 or even above $37.00..... Cramer is very good at creating bag holders.... sometime he’s spot one.... HOWEVER, I never foolishly follow this guy... That said 9 out of 10 times, I owned his stock pick way before he pumped it up....So just do your own home work on this...... Find your own bull market....... Because either T and/or VZ can and should always be good paying dividends stocks for long term holders .......despite Cramer pumps and dumping opinions about either T or VZSomething to consider ...... 10k in a savings account will make you $0.17 per month ....

5009,"7 Reasons AT&T is undervalued and poised to outperform... 1) T offers a high dividend yield backed by a growing stream of free cash flows.2) T is aggressively paying-down debt which decreases its risk profile every year.3) T has begun an aggressive share repurchase program which will take advantage of the low price to earnings multiple in the stock price.4) T expects adjusted EPS to hit $4.65 by 2022 at the midpoint.5) T expects to pay off 100% of the debt issued for the Time Warner acquisition and end with debt to EBITDA of 2.0 to 2.25 times by 2022.6) T expects $31 billion in free cash flow at the midpoint by 2022.7) T has guided to use between 50% and 70% of free cash flow after the dividend for retiring shares (over 3% annually) and expects to retire 70% of shares issued for the Time Warner acquisition by 2022 (about 750 million shares).Assuming T hits their target of $4.65 in 2022 EPS, shares appear too cheap. Even if assuming no multiple expansion, then they arrive at a share price of $49 in 2022, or approximately 15% total annual returns over the next three years. Assuming T sees multiple expansion to 12 times earnings, shares would trade at $56, or approximately 18% total annual returns.Source: Seeking Alpha",0.986
