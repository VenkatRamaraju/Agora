13,"So what I'm gathering is that Kellogg's sold a few of its non-core assets to consolidate and prioritize their growth strategy, which includes capitalizing on growing dietary and lifestyle trends with healthier foods and sustainable farming, while also acquiring businesses in developing economies to target emerging market growth.The dip is a direct result of marginally reduced operating profits from the divestiture and lower short term guidance. They're investing elsewhere in both operating facilities, businesses and product innovation, they're seeing organic sales growth in most geographical regions. They're still a profitable enterprise and making moves to try and secure themselves for the future.Our global population is continuing to grow and we will only have more mouths to feed, I'll take a nibble at this stock when it dips over SHORT TERM outlook and then I will hold it over the LONG TERM for the dividend income.Disclaimer *I'm just an amateur retail investor, don't take my words for financial advice*",0.9484

As well K is desperately trying to uplift sales, this is not a company KO would buy, until they see a turnaround plan potentially working. As well if an agreement was being discussed the Kelloggs Trust would not be selling shares as they just did, 8,000,000 million dollars worth.

I love it when there is good talk and informative talk. But when the venting comes it is really just out of hand. There is know one who knows OPKO's destiny. Whether it fails and trades to the 8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1. I read threw a couple of smart cats on this board and then can't believe they post all day about doomsday. The doomsday you all should be thinning about is where this country is going to be in 4 years from now after the election. Dr. Frost has made mistakes. But I would love to have his money. So people can bash all they want about HIM, not the stock, and wonder what it would be like to have unlimited funds to spend. Have you ever passed his home on the water in Florida? The biggest blunder he made with OPKO was to obtain BRLI. It diluted this stock very badly. Very badly. But OPKO will get pass that, bash all you want and possibly have a great future. What is one of the biggest things you learn in investing? That losses are on paper. If the stock has traded down to levels of the past, paper loss. I feel as I have said before that OPK is trading where it should be. It got out of hand. Without there own revenue from drugs that may be approved, it will sit here. With 600M shares OS, it will sit here. As I have said before, if you where long and made a good trade at higher prices, great. If you where short and made a good trade then great. Who the F$$K cares about anything else. We invest and trade. Hold long or short. And are all in it to make MONEY. So I say good luck to everyone and I mean it.",0.9984

Here is a list of their holdings. https://fintel.io/i/creative-planning If you scroll down about 1/4 of the page you get to $262,000. That mean they have more money in ONP that 3,500 of their 4,800 positions. Also, keep in mind there are 100,000 publicly traded stocks they could buy. That put ONP in the top 1% or 2% of all stock world wide.""https://fintel.io/i/creative-planningChris goes down 1/4 of this page and Chris sees (for example) AAPL (current value) at $338,582 and he thinks that Creative's AAPL position is about the same their ONP position. What Chris doesn't KNOW is that Creative owns 2,356,831 shares of AAPL worth over $338 MILLION. All this blathering IDIOT needs to do is look UP to the TOP of the page (same column) to see CURRENT VALUE ($K) that ($K) means THOUSANDS and $338,582,000 is what their AAPL position is. In order to arrive at something similar to ONP's $260K position one needs to scroll FAAAAAR DOWN the page to where there's a $260 position. Yes Creative certainly has a boat load of miniscule positions but as a PERCENTAGE of Creative's TOTAL portfolio, ONP represents almost exactly 0.001% of their TOTAL portfolio, in anybody's books this ONE THOUSANDTHS of ONE PERCENT represents not even a ROUNDING ERROR. To most SANE PEOPLE, Creative's ONP position is TOTALLY INSIGNIFICANT to a company with $24 billion under management.",0.986
