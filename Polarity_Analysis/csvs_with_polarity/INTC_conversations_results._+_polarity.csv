190,"Intel’s price is a function of supply and demand. With supply held constant, price is then determined by demand. Intel's price is a function of investors willingness to buy, or owners’ willingness to sell. What motivates them to buy? Investors feel Intel's current price is a bargain and they can make money either in the short or long term. Owners of the stock sell because they are taking profits, or they fear they will lose money if they don't. We have all been on both side of that equation. So why is Intel's price sinking? Again, supply and demand. Currently, supply is greater than demand, so price goes down. Why you ask? Intel makes a ton of money. It's coming out with new products. It owns the market. Why would anyone sell? Fear and profit taking is probably the best answer anyone can give you. Also the competition. And I don't just mean AMD or Nvidia, but the thousands of other stocks out there that you could have invested in if you didn't have your money tied up in Intel. This we can call the ""opportunity cost"" of investing in Intel. It's hard to watch Intel's price go down or drift sideways while many other stocks are going through the roof. We all want to be part of a winning trade. So investors might sell because the grass is greener on the other side of the fence. Still others might jump ship for dry land. Which is to say, they take their money out of the market entirely, either to keep it safe or to spend it. Anyway, as you already know, there are many reasons why investors sell. The big question is, what can Intel do to encourage investors to buy? They already tried a stock buyback program, which was a complete flop, and an expensive one at that. So, what's next? Better PR? New dynamic leadership? Better products? Fix the Fab part of their business? Get into another line of business? Investors need a reason to pick Intel over all the other stocks out there. So far Intel has not given them a reason to do so. AMD, Nvidia, Tesla, all have a story to tell. It’s one of hope and of huge potential for the future. That’s a narrative Intel is lacking. Intel’s competitors are controlling the narrative while Intel is left holding the bag. Analysts have promoted this narrative portraying AMD and Nvidia as Knights in shining armor on a holy and glorious quest to subdue the dragon beast, “Intel”. What can Intel do? It needs to fight back. It needs to flip the script. It needs to say they are going to kick their competitors ashes. Intel needs to stop being a punching bag and start being the puncher.

I even dropped a hint more than a month ago when I wrote a long piece in $INTC and AMD boards, about Intel’s buyback and its financial engineering, and I flagged that sentence as well (check my history post).So, what’s with this all about? This is an echo boom from 2018, the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities induced panic buying.When Intel revealed the vulnerability back in January 2018, Intel’s stock immediately took a hit. People even accused the ex-CEO Brian Krzanich sold his stocks prior to this, as Intel sat on the information for 6 months (informed by Google) before making it public.I knew it then that Intel was toast, but not immediately. That’s why I started buying AMD shares in larger quantity and accumulating them for the long haul (average price below $12). Although the launch of Ryzen and EPYC were exciting, this is the break that AMD needed to make meaningful server market share gain down the road.To mitigate the HARDWARE vulnerabilities, the system firmware needed to be patched. But the patching would cause a performance hit of 10% to 30%, and that’s a big deal. A properly sized server should have 50-70% CPU utilization at most time, below that is a waste of idle resources, above that could mean it may not be able to handle sudden spike of work demand. Servers’ statistics are being monitored and logged 24x7, among them are CPU utilization for abnormal activities and capacity planning. Each server would have customized threshold to be considered normal operation, exceeding that, warning or critical alarms would go out to operation personnel to investigate and take action if necessary. For example, a warning would go out if all CPUs in a server is running at 80+% for 2 hours, or a critical alert if they have been at 100% for more than 15 minutes, etc. Now, imagine how many alarms would be tripped after a server have been patched, Intel that own 99% of the server market share at the time had just made a bunch of enemies with people that run the datacenters. But the payback would be later.For the immediate aftermath, Intel made it out like a bandit, they had huge earning beat for the next 2 quarters (look at the chart, 35% gain in 6 months) while the expectation was people would flee from buying Intel servers. Like it or not, you can’t just buy AMD servers to augment the Intel servers, it would take time to test everything before it could be rolled out to production. Yes, they are both x86 based, but underneath there are differences, like device drivers, libraries, kernel tuning and etc. Short term solution was to buy similar if not identical Intel servers to increase capacity, causing huge shortages as reported by Intel, remember those days?Fast forward 3 years. Those extra servers will reach their “end of life” starting 2021. Unlike consumer PCs/laptops, people will keep using them as long as they meet their needs. I am still using one of my laptops that is 8 years old, although it was a top of the line Intel i7 when I bought it.However, a server useful life is 3 maybe up to 5 years. There is a reason for the 3 years magic number. A new server typically comes with 1 year warranty, and the vendors will throw in 2 more years of extended warranty for a relatively small and attractive fees if agreed upon upfront. Servers hardly have any hardware issue in the first 3 years so it is extra income for them. 4th year on out, the service and maintenance fees increase substantially, and by how fast technology improve nowadays, it could be considered obsolete after 3 years anyway. On top of that, the finance and accounting people love that 3 years magic number too. It is a known fix cost that can be budgeted and depreciated over the useful life of the servers, simple math and everyone is happy.After 3 years, whoever wants to migrate to AMD should have enough time to test out the development life cycle, if they are inclined to do so. This will be one of the larger if not the largest PREDICTABLE server replacement cycle in the history, Y2K was the other one. In fact, this is so predictable, that the front end purchase orders should start trickle in by now to beat the rush that caught everyone by surprise almost 3 years ago.",0.9992

Most likely more than one, given the desperate situation on the demand side of the fab business.I think that some big-name tech companies who are tired of being bossed around or ignored by TSMC, will look to Intel's new push into the foundry business as a venue to push back on TSMC's One source market dominance.TSMC has all but eliminated the customer discounts because of massive capital expenditures of 30B. Also, most of TSMC's customers are probably not too happy about the delays for the much-needed foundry services, all in the name of waiting their turn in the ever-expanding queue.There has never been an opportunity like this for Intel to push deep into the heart of the foundry business at TSMC. With so many desperate and miffed customers at TSMC, time is ripe for defections. Any big-name defections from TSMC to Intel will instantly transform Intel from a X86 design house into a Fab powerhouse with some unique IP advantages like 3D stacking and superfin.",0.9751

232,"Notice Intel's volume of 100m is 4X the 25m daily average on Monday which is a significant move to have closed 2% lower after a decline of 17% Fri. You would expect a jump higher a bit but none happened. Looking at the charts it's clearly showing offloading of positions as it tries to raise the pps in waves but decline further and further. Offloading by institutions isn't done at once as they know such will collapse the pps. Near closing a 25m shares red down tick was sold. That's a huge block as seen in the volume chart.Murthy firing and Keller departure are clear sign of fundamental problems over many years. Hence the delay in getting 10nm yields higher to make big server chips - delaying such a whole year, and the 7nm yields delay of a year, for now. Whatever Keller was working on could have had delays too. Keller isn't doing the work himself and his appointed Intel's veteran executives reporting to him are really those that could be the cause. Certainly it's something bad.In contrast $amd execution is stellar and Huawei leaving TSMC was a luck sent from heaven as AMD got all the fab quota it needs. We should hear good news at the AMD's ER Tue in stark contrast to Intel's. I expect Intel's pps to go back to the $30s and lower as during the BK CEO days, before he left. Bob Swan won't last long. Tge problem is no one wants the job as Bob was left to be permanent CEO after being interim but couldn't do anything better than BK to fix the deep problems. Intel's losses are AMD's gains accross the board. No outsourcing of fabs can help as huge fab investment in the $10s of billions will need be written off. No one needs a failed fab technology. Samsung and TSMC have their own working 7nm, 5nm and 3nm development. Worse days with losses per share are coming to Intel. Will be a long difficult journey to recovery if at all, given AMD won't stop its leadership, just increase it further in the next few years without catching up perspective.",0.6272

As a avid and experienced pc builder thoroughly plugged into the gaming industry many people are currently holding off on a CPU until Intel releases their 12900K using socket 1700 primarily due to the huge IPC gain that it will bring to the table as well as q DDR5 platform. We have invested in GPUs and absolutely nothing is GPU bound at the moment except for maxed 4k applications like cyberpunk. Most of us as CPU bound. For example I have a 360Hz monitor and an rtx 3090. Even with my 5950x and my 10900k most games are CPU bound which means the IPC cannot push the frames fast enough due to the CPU being the bottleneck even when the 10900k is overclocked to 5.2Ghz. The only answer will be the next generation of CPUs which I believe Intel is aligned to have a higher IPC than even 5nm AMD CPUs.

In this competitive environment, large chip companies such as NVidia and INTEL are trying to penetrate other areas for pursuit of higher profit...in this case nvidia is trying to go into server chip business while intel is trying to go into GPU business. I am a long intel but I been also following Nvidia for more than 6 years now and I have good understanding of their business. Their GPU is one of the key element and advantage of going into server business since their GPU chip complement intel server chip and they have better chance now than ever before. Unfortunately there are many factors that will be difficult if not impossible to overcome... First, ARM Acquisition will not happen. Too many opposition including, big companies like Microsoft, Apple, QUALCOMM, Samsung and countries like China and so on. Which means I wouldn’t count that as NVidia’s advantage. Second, replacing data center in any companies are too expensive, too risky and ARM chip so far has unable to prove its economic sense. Third, Intel offers one stop shop for everything that works together in a DATA center and proven to be success. Why would any company risk it? Intel offer not only all hardware solutions as well as software. Best of all it’s in Intel Ecosystem and will be very difficult to leave...Having said that intel’s up coming XE HPG DG2 GPU can easily penetrate bread and better of NVDIA’s market.

INTC's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 12.03.

643,Mubadala warrants buy timing the new wafers agreement with Global foundaries and the 7nm products launching in June are ALL RELATED IN MY VIEW! Please allow me to explain. First consider inventory build. Please search for script of last AMD ER call talking about the additional amount for such included in the results and the analyst questions when all this inventory will go on sell making revenues. Consider TSMC has allocated a certain number of 7nm to AMD to start. Higher allocation follows later but for now AMD MUST BUILD UP INVENTORY EVEN IF NAVI AND ZEN 2 CHIPS ARE WORKING TODAY! Why? You cannot launch such an important line of products that AMD knows will get a lot of revenues as per lisa su forecast for 2019 without having enough chips to supply the demand. This takes months to accumulate the chips from TSMC 7nm wafers allocated to AMD AND TAKES MONEY TO PAY FOR MORE THAN THE NORMAL HIGH INVENTORY. Here is why mubadala bought the shares out of their warrants now as they had time to buy them in 2020. Why mubadala helps AMD? Because in every Ryzen 3000 and Rome epyc 2 they have 14nm chips acting as memory and ziO controllers pushing PCIe 4.0! 7nm is NOT GOOD at pushing high currents needed to drive memory modules and PCIe. Though 7nm library has different transistor sizes with different current pushing specs 14nm is better suited for that hence the genius of lisa su chiplet design! Now mubadala gets additional 14nm chips orders too keeping their fab at Global foundaries busy. Wafer agreement makes sense and warrant money to AMD funds inventory including additional 14nm chips connected with the 7nm chips and 12nm chipset controllers etc for motherboards! Mubadala takes profits but doesn't sell all investments in AMD as Softbank sold theirs in $nvda ! 75m shares at $100 pps is $7.5B ! A respectable investment to leave riding after making money on their initial AMD investment and using part to pay for warrants. 75m shares are free to mubadala without additional funds. AMD gets inventory funding without adding to debt or adding diluted stock as mubadala warrants are already committed. So $intc faces a concentrated tsunami in 2H from Rome in datacenters and Ryzen 3000 in desktop and laptop as $nvda will with navi and VII. I hope my views are helpful to my AMD's friends on this MB.

656,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Supreme Court will consider whether to declare unconstitutional a system that technology companies, including Apple Inc. and Google Inc., have used to invalidate hundreds of patents and head off litigation.In an argument at the intersection of intellectual property and the separation of powers, the justices on Monday will consider a challenge to a congressionally-created board that critics have dubbed a “death squad” because of its tendency to toss out patents.The Patent Trial and Appeal Board has invalidated more than 2,000 patents since it began work in 2012. Apple says it alone has used the board to successfully attack almost 200 patents, many held by entities interested only in filing lawsuits and extracting royalties. Congress set up the board, known as PTAB, in 2011 as a faster and cheaper alternative to litigation.But some smaller inventors see a chance to undercut the board, saying it’s become an anticompetitive tool for large companies.The case “has the potential to shut down the PTAB, if only for a moment until Congress can do something to get it back on course,” said Jim Carmichael, a former PTAB judge and now managing director of Carmichael IP. “For many inventors and patent owners, that’s a very exciting prospect.”At issue is whether more than 250 PTAB judges are serving in violation of the Constitution. The federal appeals court that handles most patent disputes said the judges have important enough powers that they need to be appointed directly by the president.Should the Supreme Court agree, it could go as far as barring the board from continuing to review and invalidate patents. The justices could also issue a more limited ruling that would strip the judges of their job protections but leave the board’s powers intact. Either way, a decision against the board could mean that hundreds of cases would have to be reconsidered.",0.9818

Hence the lower guidance for Q4 by nVIDIA (and the share price drop). And they have explicitly mentioned slowdown in datacenter in coming months.My interpretation would be it is very much possible that INTC DCG decline was indeed due to Covid-19 related slowdown (after two consecutive quarters of big increase).

No the 2nm IBM recent PR hype is 5-7 years away. $intc losing markets means AMD gaining huge revenues. $xlnx ""coprocessors"" accelerating multiple types of workloads, cannot be matched by an ARM datacenter ecosystem nor by nVidia's GPUs only. Higher chiplets integration means that many functions are tightly integrated as chiplets or as infinity fabric connections that aren't open to others like PCIe gen 4/5 and achieve much more at the lowest hardware level without software drivers. So even if the $xlnx merger won't be approved by the UK regulators fearing such will lock the UK strategic processors ARM out of future datacenters solutions, it's not preventing for a very tight partnership with Xilinx including exclusivity joint development not available to others. So achieving most of the technology future without merger and just not having the possibility to mix engineering teams to use on each otgers different other designs like taking Xilinx engineers to help future Zen development etc. That's not a biggie if the merger isn't approved especially as it's clear that the shareholders and executives at both companies want to see a tight relationship as the merger was approved by them. So read the following and contemplate what it means for AMD's PPS future and nVidia's technology use as ARM buying won't be approved. In the meantime if Xilinx's merger isn't approved on July 6, AMD's PPS jumps as it will be perceived as good for AMD's shareholders value while the 30% premium embedded in Xilinx's PPS vanished and then some creating a very big difference in staying in AMD vs risking staying in Xilinx for a few %s multiplier difference.

I just do not understand how investors are not complaining about management adding over a million shares to the stock... This level of exec compensation just seems so excessive at the expense of shareholders. The execs at AMD have already been awarded over 2M shares this year, for total exec compensation of over 100M whereas here at Intel execs have only gotten 160k or so and bought back millions of shares instead. Also, the AMD execs have been selling nearly all their shares. Why would they be doing that if they were confident their company would keep taking market share? So many small warning signs that the insiders are fleecing this bubble while they can. They are also converting debt into AMD shares and acquiring Xilinx with shares. In these cases though their sky-high evaluation helps them. I am happy that there are many innovating players in the semi space and I think AMD has been doing well and making some great products, but I just cannot trust a company that has these management practices.",0.9726

Do you believe in tooth fairies?I guess the theory goes that because Apple (Customer No 1 at TSMC) has gone on to 5nm, that has supposedly freed up capacity at TSMC at 7nm and TSMC has just handed this extra capacity to AMD. The theory further goes on to surmise that TSMC is doing this to crush Intel before Intel can rise as a viable competitor to TSMC in the Fab space. Dream on.Firstly, given the shortage of substrates and water in Taiwan, exactly where did TSMC find the capacity to give away to AMD?Secondly, this dumb theory forgets to take into account, that any spare capacity at 7nm in TSMC will not arrive in a vacuum. Many customers will be waiting. Many with deeper pockets and better value-added design solutions. TSMC will sell any and all capacity to where it can get the most return on investments. Including Intel.Thirdly, TSMC has failed to supply AMD adequately even at 14nm. Therefore we have shortages of Zen2 parts used in PS5 and Xbox's. 14nm should have been easier to supply given the fact that it did not require EUV.Lastly, TSMC will not try to play god here. It will not waste any of its hard-earned 7nm spare capacity as ammunition in a long-term battle against Intel when no end game is in sight. TSMC needs good relations with Intel, to smooth out the political landscape to be hospitable to a TSMC setting up shop in the U.S.The political narrative of TSMC can turn sour real fast, as the company that leaked the most technology to the Chinese.

I see $intc restructure its business to focus on fab manufacturing only, in the USA and Western countries like EU, Israel etc with significant Gov funding for independence of chips manufacturing national security goals vs relying on Taiwan and South Korea. Intel will sell its x86 franchise to probably nVidia as so $nvda won't buy ARM nor will it be approved as it's a UK national security and China too especially with China ARM CEO lawsuit going on. But in the next few years, AMD will rise especially as tge Xilinx merger get AMD to become the dominant chips supplier of the world. AMD's ARM architecture license allows them to make own designs compatible with ARM and Samsung has the financial muscles and fabs to fabricate such chips. AMD will grow significantly, render ARM licensing business mostly obsolete as their chips will have an intermix ECOSYSTEM of x86 pin compatible sockets, servers, mobile, laptops, PCs and added GPUs, FPGAs and other heterogeneous accelerators. Won't make sense for any company to do their own, even Amazon and Apple! So in the next 5 years, AMD is the stocks to hold all the way to $1000 SP. After many turbulences for Intel and nVidia, with significant SP decline, they could be a buy 5 years from now. If th above happens...Intel will be a pure fab manufacturing company at bigger size than TSMC after 5 years without own chips designs. While nVidia's only chance is to buy Intel's chips designs businesses, Mobileye, Altera FPGAs, x86 desigs to survive vs AMD. Intel's Flash storage will be sold to other company, it's different business than computing.

Now AMAZON, not just German retailers, showing AMD's leading sales! REMEMBER shortages as AMD's sold out everything they'd made! Yet, AMD leading means, 1. TSMC's added 80% capacity kicked in, more chips available, 2. If Intel's PCs results still had higher PCs revenues and AMD's is leading over Intel's sales on giant Intel's sales revenues, imagine the ER numbers to soon be shown by AMD! That with datacenters revenues will be even more amplified as datacenters had huge growth, they are professionals buyers, and Intel's datacenters revenues declined big time! Net - answer is Intel is beyond woried. $intc is moving to a NEW BUSINESS to become a fab manufacturer for others designs! Intel has too many problems, war on many fronts is a sure defeat. Their chips design and their fabs cannot both simultaneously be fixed. So without saying, they gave up on chips design leadership, and hope to fix fabs using the US Gov $50B planned grants to make IS based fabs PLUS GETTING HELP FROM IBM AS RECENTLY WAS REVEALED! Yrs, this article raw data on Amazon’s sales with AMD leading is very clear.

1059,"Going forward, the Intel business plan appears to be centered around selling fab services. Their Foveros technology accommodates chipets from just about any source, enabling them to manufacture 3D products for virtually any design firm. They also seem willing to combine X86 cores with other chiplets ranging from 5G to memory to ARM. Such a plan makes sense only if they intend to invest enough money and time in fab technology to manufacture the completed integrated circuits for the design company. The $20B investment promised for Arizona will have to be followed by even greater capital investments in locations throughout the world to keep pace with the likely demand for computational products.AMD, on the other hand, is limited in their growth opportunities since they no longer own a fab operation. Whatever AMD sells that depends on TSMC technology will have a gross margin that reflects the portion of the value provided by TSMC. AMD's 3D stacking technology appears to need them to bond them with one memory supplier, which will also want a suitable piece of the total pie. Once AMD gets done sharing the pie so many ways, there will be a smaller piece remaining for them.Future success for both companies will be determined over several years by their selection of the best business plan.",0.9947

Likely there will be some significant projects fueled by increased revenues that will be announced in due time. AMD is a growth story, it's always been that since Dr. Su formed the A-Team, and the direction and lucrativeness of this growth is what AMD leadership is all about going forward from this point. With TSMC taking lead and AMD's solid designs all the way to Zen 5, there's absolutely negative chance Intel can catch up now, especially after the recent security issues. Intel won't die or anything but decline will be slow and painful over next few years as Intel continues to experiment and fail repeatedly. Intel's GPU project is also fairly high risk. Keep an ey on AMD's APU strategy because the timing of this final nail on Intel's Whiskey lake coffin is crucial for a TKO. I'd abandon $intc asap. Also, Nvidia has never ever faced a fully ressurected and strong AMD before, so it will be an incredible challenge for $nvda to carve out their moat.

It became Apple’s sole supplier of modem chips.But Intel got a late start when it came to 5G and hasn’t been able to keep pace with rivals like Qualcomm. Mr. Krzanich’s abrupt departure last June for violating company policy by having a relationship with an employee left the future of the modem initiative uncertain.Intel had expected to start sending sample 5G modem chips to customers in the second half of this year and put them into production next year before dropping those plans on Tuesday.

Can Intel make exploit this opportunity?Recall, GPU accelerator (servers) always work in conjunction with a CPU, just like a Graphics card works in conjunction with CPU on your desktop.If you have paid attention to some of the technical evaluation of Intel's discrete GPUs (the lowest end one), it has been called more of an encoder/decoder for videos and less of performance GPU barely beating MX350. It is probably for a reason. Enter Intel Server GPU, released recently. The combination of Intel Xeon + Intel server GPU is 50% more efficient in power wrt competition.Where the card stands out is how it runs at a low TDP of 150 watts, or less than half of Nvidia’s RTX 3080 card, which has a TDP at 320 watts. According to Intel, the product can help clients consolidate their servers into a smaller footprint while keeping power costs low.The reason is ""Synergy"" between Xeon and the Intel GPU.(source: PCMag)With upcoming Sapphire rapids in 2021 and pcie5 support expected before AMD, there is a good chance Intel will be dominant in the space.

It turns out the patches had bugs of their own. The glitch underscores the complexity of Intel's challenge as it scrambles to fix the unprecedented vulnerabilities (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/intel-says-significant-progress-made-to-protect-chips-vulnerable-to-exploits-2018-01-04), which were disclosed more than a week ago. In a confidential document shared with some customers Wednesday and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Intel (INTC) said it identified three issues in updates released over the past week for ""microcode,"" or firmware -- software that is installed directly on the processor. The updates are separate from patches produced by operating system companies such as Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Read:What can you do to protect your PC against Meltdown and Spectre chip flaws?

""Intel will provide frequent updates.""

I mean, if all you have is a penny, and you find another penny on the street, your wealth has increased by 100%. But how rich are you? Two cents worth! Right? Comparing AMD to Intel is like trying to compare a Mom and Pop convenience store to Walmart. The Mom and Pop store has the potential to grow faster, because it’s starting from the bottom. But Walmart will probably have the greater chance to make more money. Which of the two would you feel safer putting your money? So why would anyone invest their money in a smaller stock? Many reasons, but when it comes to AMD vs. Intel, logic goes out the window as other forces are at work to push one stock over the other. Why would these forces think and act illogically? Because it’s safer to control and manipulate the markets rather than to allow the markets to find their own equilibrium. Every minute of everyday money managers, and their proxies, are hard at work separating you from your money by controlling the narrative with their highly skilled, well paid analysts, self-appointed experts and market commentators many of whom many work for the rich. It’s no surprise then that you often find yourself on the wrong side of the trade because you have been controlled from the very beginning as to what to buy and when to buy, and when to sell, the bandwagon effect. They have a well thought out plan to separate you from your money using all three. Proof! When they tell you to buy, price goes down. When they tell you to sell your shares, price goes up. How can you avoid this market manipulation? Hedge your bets by owning various stocks, example AMD and Intel and Nvidia, and not put all your eggs in one basket. Or by using options. Either way remember, the stock market is a casino. You are BETTING on a stock to go up or down. Hedge your bets and you may have a greater chance to win.

This is because the chiplets design that has high yields earlier - already 70% vs Intel's 30% for its monolithic single chip processors. But because 7nm is higher density than Intel's 14nm, in addition to gain from yields there is gain from making way MORE CHIPS PER WAFER! in other words, even if Intel's yield would have been 70% in 14nm with their single big chip, AMD's 7nm produces many more chips per wafer! If Intel could have shrunk their big chip to 7nm in addition to having 70 yield, the smaller area chips now made out of the same area wafer in 7nm double the chips numbers! So AMD's can afford cutting Intel's prices in half and still making way higher profits! Intel cannot cut prices due to big chip and yields. If they try compete with AMD on price they operate at a loss! They do this for limited number of chips in 10nm just to show off with products performance worse than 14nm chips. It's a big meds. New CEO cannot declare AMD will take 25% market share as the previous CEO has stated and was fired! But Intel has nothing for the next few years that will take to make new chiplets design and new 7nm fab as the 10nm fab cannot be fixed.

But nVidia's PPS collapse would be way worse than Intel's possible going back to $100ish and latter as they fail get approval to buy ARM even lower. Why? AMD EPYC will lock nVidia's GPUs out of datacenters ecosystem ! Now nVidia's Ampere uses EPYC Rome in the datacenters with PCIe gen 4. The coming cDNA Arcturus datacenters GPUs will have 50 teraflops double precision - see my previous posts - vs 10 teraflops with Ampere.

If nVidia's future GPUs had a competitive chance, nVidia WOULD HAVE WON AT LEAST ONE BID OF SUPERCOMPUTER THE DOE AWARDED! They got 0.

2261,"I am trying to think of a good parallel, in another industry, to what is now happening in the semiconductor industry, and without much luck. Whereas companies that designed semiconductors in the 1980's also made them, that is no longer the case. Now design and manufacture are two separate businesses. Design has become greatly simplified with modern software tools. Interestingly, advances in semiconductors three years ago have enabled more complicated design technology that is in use today. The industry continuously pulls itself up by its bootstraps. Semiconductor design, as a business, is easier to enter than fabrication. The cost of setting up a design company is very small in today's environment, but the cost of setting up a fab is enormous. A fab costs at least $10 billion, and that is before any product is produced. To be successful, the fab must include the latest and greatest manufacturing equipment, but that's just a start. It has to have thousands of people to manage the facility, and then it requires the support of many chip designers to keep it working at full capacity. The money must be spent on the facility before the operators can be hired and the fab's capabilities demonstrated to clients. It is one of the highest fixed cost and highest risk businesses that I can think of. And that's why China is financially backing its local fab companies. I am not sure that it would be possible to establish a fab business without public backing, which is why Intel is in an enviable position. I have spent many hours working with Intel on fab issues, and the comments that I hear about Intel needing years to catch up really annoy me. Their current problem stems from years of under investment by a management that was unaware of the nature of Intel's business, and the competitive threats. The word stupid comes to mind. Gelsinger knows what he's doing, but we will have to give him some time and trust. We're already seeing some green shoots of progress under his direction, and more of the same is coming soon. Some seemingly small developments will not be appreciated by most investors. One of the greatest challenges is to restore the culture of the company, and some of what he does will help accomplish that, but not be appreciated by most.",0.9991
2262,"Speaking looely, nVIDIA's new server processor's major is to ensure high bandwidth communication between CPU and GPU for training and specialized AI applications using NVME link. Needless to say, the incumbent x86 processors in servers won't support this over pcie for a competitor.Few points to be noted. Without this feature, the writing on the wall for nvidia is loss of GPGPUs for AI in HPC/servers as both Intel/AMD have their own CPUs and server (Intel about to launch) GPUs. This has a real risk of putting nvidia in disadvantage. Ponte-Veccio, does 41 TOPS in FP64 TODAY in Silicon as opposed to nVIDIA's best Ampere's 11 TOPS of FP64. Indeed, as Pat Gelsinger pointed, it's a reaction by nVIDIA to stop INTC/AMD to eat into its server GPU market, NOT the other way round. The market, as usual, is irrational and prone to pump.The first purported silicon will be available in 2023 and remember it will be competitive (BIG IF) only for certain AI workloads (Not all). A realistic competitor is due by 2025.What's the chance the first Silicon will succeed? ZERO!!Server Silicon is not a joke. Amazon worked on graviton for 5 years and only a few months back the processor has some semblance of competitiveness in BENCHMARKS, selling and making money from them is YEARS YEARS away. AMZN can put them into their own AWS, nvidia has to show profits by selling them ASAP. How difficult it is to get a competitive silicon for CPU? Ask Samsung.They had their Exynos SoC with custom ARM cores being designed for years into their OWN mobiles and other hardware. Yet, with all the multi-year effort in Austin Research Center, they could not beat Snapdragon for their flagship phones. And Samsung, let me tell you, is one heck of competitive company. None other than ex-AMD head of Opteron lead that development for a decade!Plus, Intel is coming up with Ponte-Vecchio, and many more EMIB/Foveros packaged devices and they have till 2025 to deliver. In summary, nvidia's so called processor is first of all targeting only a subset of workloads in servers, their chances of competitive silicon are low and selling them is not a given. Competitors are not going to sit idle.If at all, I believe this is nVIDIA's shot at protecting its server GPU turf from INTC/AMD, not the other way round.

In the short term the pcie 3 Mobo would be fine with the pcie4 CPU but added a new nvda gpus which is pcie4 , i would think that there would be some long term issues. The main one being if the primary use were for games with high refresh rate this would be considerably more bandwidth than other games in addition to a higher refresh rate monitor, nvme drives, and other optical devices that share the same bus.

2360,"For all the people on this board that are monofocused on AMD vs NVIDIA vs Intel and transistor size in chips, realize that this industry is much, much broader than that. Intel's current market is far broader than AMD's or NVIDIA's. Their R&D addresses a swath of technologies related to modern computer and communication infrastructure: AI, Internet of things, self driving cars, servers, cloud, networks, GPU, CPU, Memory and Storage, 5G, integrated photonics, non-silicon transistors, Quantum computing... No other semi company has such a diverse collection of expertise other than perhaps Samsung. TSMC and their clients: AMD, NVIDIA, Apple, Huawei...and others are doing great, but the rapidly growing chip/network market has more than enough room for multiple players to grow as we saw this year. Everyone grew in 2020. But speaking more specifically of the chip market, Intel is in a unique position that rivals who outsourced are not. Namely: control over their supply. As one of only 3 companies in the world with their own cutting edge fab technology (TSMC, Samsung, and Intel)...this is where the real competition is. And Intel is the only remaining Western company that has their own cutting edge semi research and fabs and produces chips in house. This gives them a unique cost and supply advantage. For one, the US government will likely preferentially invest in and buy from them for supply security reasons. So may other governments that want to have redundancy of supply. The market needs more than one player for innovation to thrive. The fact that rivals outsource gives them access to TSMCs semi technology, but dramatically lowers their margins and makes them dependent on TSMC succeeding to continue to stay ahead. Demand for TSMC fab space is so high that they are already raising how much they charge by about 20% after accepting Apple as a new customer, raising the costs for producers that outsource fab technology. TSMC is currently trying to ramp up new fab space to meet the demand, but that takes time and meanwhile the world is in a CPU shortage, something that will benefit Intel who has invested to double their fab capacity since 2017 and whose chips are more than adequate and affordable for most clients. This is why Intel keeps selling their chips as quickly as they can make them. You don't need to be the world leader to have good sales, what you need is to be able to produce large amounts of chips that offer competitive performance at affordable prices, and here Intel really has the cost advantage. What other US rival can afford to offer the pricing Intel does on the low end for PC and Notebook if there is a cost war? Certainly not NVIDIA or AMD who outsource fab research and pay for it per chip. What matters for overall profitability is not that you have the most advanced microstructure, but that you can produce a lot of something that works well at an affordable price. Yield matters. It doesn't matter if you have an advanced chip if you can't produce enough of it at a price that will meet demand. Intel's current advantage isn't that they lead in process node, but that they have independent supply and a lower cost basis than other US rivals. On the high-end technical side of transistor density and latest gen chip architecture: Intel clearly stated in their cc that they are committed to keeping up their own semi R&D and trying to reclaim leadership. It is very common in this industry for a roadmap to be delayed or a new node to be flawed with low yields. It has happened in the past to all the major players at various times: TSMC, Samsung, and Intel have all experienced it and been leaders at various times. It happened to Intel most recently, but it will likely happen again for the other major players as well. How do you think that will affect Intel's rivals who all try to use TSMC if they have a delay, a yield issue, or supply problems as they have had in the past? Even if TSMC stays in the lead, the fact that everyone wants to partner with them will raise costs, meaning Intel will have uniquely profitable margins on the chips they do sell. Also keep in mind that node improvements from a transistor size standpoint are stagnating as we approach atomic limits. Most of the improvement isn't coming from increases in transistor density, but through parallelization (increasing corecount), AI optimizations, and clever structure/material breakthroughs that lower the mounting resistance issues as junctions get tinier. This is why Intel's chips have been able to stay competitive and why customers are still placing massive orders year after year...Intel excels on optimizing 3D chip architecture. Also, keep in mind that the the process names (10,7,5,3nm) are marketing. It is roughly tied to the thinnest dimension of the fundamental transistor, but better metrics that customers look at is transistor density in the wafer and power requirements. Intel is not far behind at all in transistor density.",0.9997

John / OsulinFOOL / braccrapus - you can keep trying to be positive but Intel is just too far behind AMD and it’ll take 3-4 years to compete while AMD takes market share and is in hyper growth mode! Enjoy the weekend I know I will :)https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/intel-vs-amd-ces-2019/,0.9739

2435,"Here's a classic example why financial based analysts cannot make it big in technology ahead of the time and where own deep DD understanding of the technology can beat Wallstreet. AMD obviously is an example as longs here know but the near future is more amazing for AMD yet still a miss for Wallstreet who doesn't really understand deep technology. Recent analyst research note:“In our view, 2020 appears to be a major recovery year for the semiconductor market,” analyst Harsh Kumar wrote on Wednesday. “Inventory levels are low across the board, and with a soothing trade narrative, we expect a strong pick-up in demand.”True.

2588,"Microsoft ARM Dollars and SenseGartner estimated Surface sales of about 600K per qtr - say 2.5M a year. 1. Say Surface ARM is wildly successful (NOT) and reach 1M units a year in 3 years at $500 each (Surface RT $500) ie Surface ARM revenue of $500M a year for a company doing more than $150B sales by that time! Say it's very profitable at 20% net margin ie net profits of $100M for a company that's today doing $45B of net income from operations. Does it make sense for them to embark on a MAJOR Chip R&D effort for a measly additional annual revenue of $500M and a measly 0.2% contribution to the bottom line IF IT'S VERY SUCCESSFUL - which is very doubtful.2. Surface ARM will have great battery life. At the time Surface ARM RT was introduced it had about 2X the typical X86 battery life BUT IT FLOPPED .... ""Microsoft's original Surface model was a $400 ARM-based Windows RT product, flanked by a more conventional, low-voltage x86 Surface Pro model that the company compared to Apple's MacBooks. Surface RT flopped dramatically across four years of trying because it didn't do what Windows customers expected of a Windows device: run most Windows software. That left Microsoft to focus on Surface Pro as its mobile, x86 PC tablet designed to be used with a keyboard and stylus. "" Today a typical Ryzen 4000 notebook runs 8 hrs routinely if the manufacturer doesn't skim on the battery size. OK Surface ARP Pro X runs upto 15 hrs - isn't this similar scenario to RT days - at 8hrs it's less compelling to need 15hrs! for me.3. Microsoft ARM today addresses the performance and compatibility issue or at least the compatibility issues..by creating a 64Bit emulation and an ARM variant Microsoft ARM SQ1 which is ""more suited for computer based applications than CP"" - with it comes a larger power draw than CP ARM. ""THE KEY HERE IS MICROSOFT'S NEW SQ1 CHIP BASED ON THE ""ARM"" ARCHITECTURE. These chips are often made for mobile devices like smartphones, but the SQ1 chip has been engineered to provide computer-like performance rather that smartphone performance. "" - ""As a result, an ARM-based laptop designed for computer performance isn't going to get the same battery life as a smartphone.""""While the SQ1 chip in the Surface Pro X is designed for computer performance, IT WON'T BE POWERFUL ENOUGH FOR HEAVY DUTY TASKS LIKE GAMING OR VIDEO EDITING. But for everything else, like web browsers and productivity apps like Microsoft Office, it's likely all anyone would ever need.""4. Here's the TKO punch .... ""The key here is Microsoft's so-called ""SQ1"" chip, a processor made by Qualcomm that's based on the ""ARM"" architecture. "" SO MICROSOFT IS NOT GOING INTO THE CHIP BUSINESS!

2813,"A transistor is an electronic device that can be used as either a switch or an amplifier. An NPN transistor is like an Oreo cookie, it has three parts, two outer N layers with a P layer sandwiched in the middle. In the middle of this NPN Oreo transistor cookie is an electric field (capacitance) which prevents the flow of electrons through the transistor. In a typical NPN silicon transistor a voltage or 0.7 volts is needed to overcome the electric field and allow electrons to flow. Using different materials, Intel has reduced the electric field (capacitance) that prevents the flow of electrons and therefore reduced the amount of energy needed to control the transistor. I am assuming this improvement in design can be used across all chip designs and sizes. A new transistor is much different than simply a smaller transistor. It will take any size transistor and make it 20% more efficient. That is a technology that Intel can keep for itself or lease for others to use, or maybe both.

Although most PC users won't notice the difference it is likely that the Spectre-Meltdown will encourage owners of PCs older than three years to upgrade those systems ahead of schedule producing a revenue lift for 2018. In laptops and 2-1s the case is particularly compelling because of the 30% overall performance gain of the new quad-core Kaby Lake CPUs. In desktops moving from a quad-core to a six-core i8700K easily compensates for any performance hits related to Spectre & Meltdown remedies.

The question of independent USA controlled foundries, and the China problem are closely tied together. We cannot be dependent on China in anyway. The 2 Chinas are one China, depending whom you talk to. The USA only recognizes mainland China. The two Navies (USA & China) will settle this in the Taiwan Straits, one way or the other.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------QUESTION :"" Why is China so fearful of Taiwan becoming independent?ANSWER : With the return of Hong Kong to Chinese control in July 1997, Taiwan remains one of the few areas over which Beijing claims sovereignty but does not control. It is widely viewed by Chinese on the mainland as the last vestige of the century of humiliation that began with the Opium Wars in the middle of the nineteenth century. The persisting separation of the mainland and Taiwan is also portrayed as a hindrance to China’s reemergence as a great power, which President Xi Jinping has dubbed the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The Chinese Communist Party’s legitimacy is linked to its pledge to achieve reunification of Taiwan with the motherland. A commonly held view on the mainland is that no Chinese leader could remain in power if he allowed Taiwan to separate from the PRC and be recognized by the international community as an independent sovereign state.The Anti-Secession Law, adopted by Beijing in 2005, sets forth three conditions under which China would be justified in using “non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity: 1) Taiwan independence forces cause Taiwan’s secession from China; 2) Major incidents entailing Taiwan’s secession from China occur; or 3) possibilities for peaceful reunification are completely exhausted.Bonnie S. Glaser is a senior adviser for Asia and director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C. Michael J. Green is senior vice president for Asia and holds the Japan Chair at CSIS.""",0.9953

No, I think not.AMD, IBM, Qualcomm, Google, Apple, NVidia, Huawei, Microsoft, Micron and yes even Intel are dependent on a company called TSMC.TSMC has grown to be the only viable supplier of advanced node semiconductors to the information industry. Many of the companies I mentioned above with the possible exception of Intel, have viewed moving to more advanced nodes as the easy way of gaining a competitive advantage in the market place. This makes TSMC a monopoly.Now, this monopoly is nothing like the past monopoly’s we have read about in the past, the likes of Standard Oil Co or U.S. Steel Co. It is different principally, in its cost structure. Past monopoly businesses were good at obtaining exclusive access to what everybody wanted at low cost; TSMC has exclusive access to what everybody wants (computing power) by pushing the limits of physics at very high cost.In the third quarter of 2018, a total of 18 percent of TSMC production was on the 10nm and 7nm node. This is before TSMC getting into the very messy business of producing EUV chips. It is the place no foundries in its right mind would want to go to. It is the place where yields are low, costs are high and most importantly, the place where most customers of TSMC, will be content with, for a very short time.This brings me back to my starting point. If AMD is able to gain any traction in Intel’s markets, it will have to share the bounty with a company that is its only viable supplier. A supplier, that has earned its place at a very high cost. TSMC is no position to give discounts to AMD, just to see it take out Intel.Given the slowing demand for semiconductors by the likes of Apple and Nvidia, and the shortened lead times at TSMC; AMD may not have to wait for long for its chip supplies, but it better pray that the demand for the likes of the iPhone’s don’t pick up any time soon.",0.9975

This is after rumors of Warhol 6nm Zen3+ being cancelled as a stand alone Ryzen pure CPU. Now let's connect this news to Sony upgraded 6nm Playstation rumors AND a new upgraded X570S motherboard! All leaked recently. What do we get? A powerful new mobile Ryzen coming very soon... to be used as desktop and consoles APUs too, just like the rumored Ryzen 5700G which is a Ryzen mobile chip with higher power and AM4 socket desktop use.So now let's understand that TSMC's 6nm is a more sharply definitely Extreme UV lithograph that is compatible with 7nm designs. 5nm requires complete new masks and designs and of course provides substentially higher improvements. Advantage of the 6nm is ability to CONVERT 7nm fab lines quickly to 6nm by ADDING EUV etching machines. EUV results in sharper lines features, hence can get devices dencer closer to each other with less capacity of the metal lines for example. So higher clock speeds and lower power use are possible. The net is all above links are connected and could result in new laptops launching at Computex Taipei June 1st! Lisa Su Computex opening keynote is a big event to show new products related to Computex. Obviously 6nm Rembrandt is...! Connect the dots... you'll see what is coming. . $100+ EASY! $intc doesn't have an answer, their Tiger kitten cannot even compete with past 7nm chips. ADDITIONAL TSMC fab capacity will prevent Intel selling low end chips at a big discount. Just because AMD's are sold out.$nvda will suffer a blow in the mainstream GPUs line as 12 SPs vs previous 8 with faster clock speeds and Zen3+ integration is all it needs for most people.

3165,"INTC, AMD, and NVDA are locked in a competitive struggle that is fragmenting the market. AMD has some leading edge products out, but it's only as good as it's last product release. And what happens when AMD can no longer leverage the X86 processor due to competition with RISC V and ARM? I think that Xilinx is a hail mary pass, and will never yield the return that AMD is hoping. FPGA has been around for a long time, and its market is small volume applications which are too small to justify ASIC development and production. NVDA is the leading video chip provider and hopes to complete the ARM purchase and compete in more generalized CPU's. But it will take time to replace X86 in cloud computing centers, and the NVDA AI may not evolve to become the market leader. For the near future it will have to depend on gamers and cryptocurrency miners, both of which are not terribly reliable markets. INTC sees the fragmentation and is trying to further develop whatever advantage it can in areas in which it has more IP that most. For example, 3D packaging with Foveros will be featured, and fab capacity in the USA and allies will be leveraged as assurance of a continuing, reliable source of products. I think INTL believes that it can match AMD step for step in CPU performance whenever it wants, and I agree. It is therefore focusing on areas that will yield a more durable advantage. Picking the best of the three is tough, but I am favoring INTC primarily due to its fab capacity. Next is NVDA, and AMD is wiping up the rear.",0.9978

3569,"If RTX was a success, we wouldn't have a 1660 GPU. This means that we will see an Ampere sooner because Nvidia needs to correct their misstep asap. Nvidia's growth story basically was purchased for $7B. But is it really growth? In-house interconnect doesn't really benefit all that much compared to commodity. Mellanox was smart with timing their exit strategy benefitting all their shareholders. Microsoft would have benefitted far more. Nvidia got punked. There's still a silver lining but this acquisition is no different than Dell acquiring Force10 to interconnect their servers but still it.makes sense for Dell although it didn't really add much compared to the overhead involved because Force10 became commodity fast. Same with Extreme Networks, Cisco catalyst, brocade, Nortel etc. Arista has been holding on but not for long. Nvidia really needed a CPU design team, not a networking switching company. Imo this puts $AMD and $INTC in a more favorable position over next 2 years. Paying $7B for a tech that will be generic 'made in china' in less than two years is a gamble. But Nvidia had no choice, there was no other option for this one-trick pony. Laptops do not need 4K. 1440p will become an APU affair in a few months. 4K gaming and VR is AMD territory with Navi and consoles. Intel's GPU is also joining the opencompute anti-cuda forces.

We would all like to own a Ferrari, Maserati, Lamborghini or a Tesla EV, but do we need one to go shopping or picking up lumber at the home depot? No, that would be overkill. Most people would be happy with a Ford, Toyota, SUV or a broken-down pickup truck. And in the computer world, most people would be happy with a 14nm or a 10nm, which Intel excels at. That is probably why Intel continues to make big buck because they focus on the larger segment of computer buyers while AMD and Nvidia go after the elite, much smaller segment. Yeah, it would be nice if Intel could make a 7nm or a 5nm chip, but do they really need to focus on that to be highly profitable?",0.9974

3808,"The Dell report shows that Intel is a major force in OEM Laptops and PC's. Intel doesn't have the top spec consumer CPU ( won't have one until 2024 and maybe never ) but how many Gamers are buying Threadrippers for $3000 and how many Gamers need 50 cores ? Streamers are doing ok with 8 cores ( running multiple software ) and lag is often due to game settings, faulty software or poor Internet connection and poor cloud service at peak times. What's more important is the power usage benefit of going to 7 nm but are AMD's 7 nm setups that much lower Watt ? Intel's low power CPU's ( at 10 nm ) are currently 5 to 8 W under normal workload. How much lower Watt can Intel go before CPU needs become irrelevant vs. the screen and other parts of a Laptop ? because the power need of a CPU can never reach zero or negative. I.e. When Intel goes to 7 nm it will save another Watt ( max 2 Watts ) per Laptop but this is going to increase the battery life by approx 5 % for the average setup. Also. Is it worth to scrap an entire Data Center ( worth $50 million ) to save 15 % on the electrical bill and to incur a costly transition period without gaining any noticeable reliability or speed ? No. New data centers are built when the old ones becomes obsolete and/or non functioning or when the hardware becomes so old that the engineers and the new software becomes non compatible and even then the reliability is King vs. saving 10 % on electricity, because even a downtime of 5 seconds per year can cost a business more money than the entire energy bill especially in finance and trading. The only exception to this is BTC mining operations but mining for BTC isn't going to determine the sales of server setups for the entire future of human kind. The parabolic increase of btc data centers has pumped up sales of primarily Nvidia. However. Nvidia's massive increase of revenue ( the past 8 years ) has never been a drag to Intel's revenue but on the contrary has helped Intel's revenue into data centers and storage. Finally. How many manufacturers that are based in the USA are experiencing an increase in revenue for 2020 ? You may say Apple but Apple is not an Am. manufacturer and it's also valued a lot higher.",0.9964

3886,"What is the inherent value of INTC? What returns can be expected by investing in INTC today?I have tried to build base + other more optimistic scenarios.BASE scenario:Let's assume INTC does as good or bad as it has done historically in the last 10 years. That includes good years as well as last few bad years.From EPS perspective. Intel increased its EPS from $2.14 in 2011 to $4.94 in 2020. That's an average increase of 8.7% per year. Projecting the same to 2025, we have an EPS of $7.50.This case does not assume any tailwinds from Fabs, GPUs, 5G and Mobileye. (even in the last 3-4 years, when admittedly ran into fab problems, INTC increased EPS at much higher rate).Assigning a modest PE of 22 (current S&P PE ratio is 38 and projected to remain high due to fed printing of money for a foreseeable future).That gives us a PT of $165 at the end of 2025, excluding the dividends. Assuming ~2% yearly dividend, that's another 12-13% return on an investment made today. That's a compounded rate of return of 21% annually in BASE scenario.I believe it is a very compelling rate of return with very low risk. If Fab business, GPUs, 5G and Mobileye take-off (even one of them), it can boost returns even further to mid 20s. No multi-bagger but very compelling investment with good sleep at night. Possible federal support for fabs in terms of tax breaks etc are additional and highly likely tailwinds.Summary: Intel may have some market share loss but I believe overall INTC will maintain its revenue growth in medium to long term (5+ years). There is a high likelihood that out of IDM 2.0, Mobileye, GPU and 5G, a few bets may pay-off very well, leading to at the very minimum average PE ratio. In that case, it is a compelling investment. No multi-bagger may be, but still promising rate of return (20 pct +) in next five years.GLTA.Source: Macrotrends",0.9951

4053,"Intel has licenses to do business with Huawei revoked - ReutersJan. 18, 2021 4:48 AMIntel Corporation (INTC)By: Yoel Minkoff, SA News EditorThe Trump administration has notified Huawei suppliers, including chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), that it is revoking certain licenses to sell to the telecom equipment supplier, sources told Reuters. The administration also intends to reject dozens of other applications to supply the Chinese company, escalating tensions with Beijing during its final days in office.Backdrop: The U.S. put Huawei on a Commerce Department ""entity list"" in May 2019, restricting suppliers from selling American goods and technology to the firm. Some sales like semiconducters required licenses as Washington intensified its crackdown on the company, which it labeled a national security threat.The latest action is likely to be the last against Huawei under President Trump, with Joe Biden taking the oath of office on Wednesday. It will also play out in the early days of the Biden administration (unless he decides to cancel the order).Companies that received the ""intent to deny"" notices about supplying Huawei have 20 days to respond, and the Commerce Department has 45 days to advise them of any change in a decision or it becomes final. Companies would then have another 45 days to appeal.Last week, the Trump administration added smartphone maker Xiaomi to a blacklist of alleged Chinese military companies, restricting American investors from buying the company's shares or related securities.",0.9713

And remember AMD is agressively taking market share from Intel they started at the workstation and grew market share from 8 to 12% in the last quarter alone in February launched mobile processors to compete with Intels high margin notebook business and they are making big inroads in the server area where their chips have the highest levels of performance and lowest cost and are not subject to the performance robbing meltdown that is workload dependent and much more likely to have severe performance problems in the cloud and virtual server environment where there is a lot of data io, system calls and context switching. In addition AMD is a launching a complete refresh Ryzen CPUS on April 19th on 12 nano with up to 18% improvements in performance and intel has nothing to compete with them as I explained.So don't be surprised to see Intel warn and this stock take a real hit when they report earnings in a few weeks.I suggest you buy some AMD to balance out your risk most won't listen but AMD is 10.04 now while intel is 50.47 lets see where they are in a few weeks and months..",0.893

So let's say you do come up with the next big deal instead of the usual kinda big deal, you do realize that it has taken Intel nearly fifty years to actually build enough capacity to meet their overall demand. AMD is incapable of supplying even a fraction of the Intel end user demand even if they wanted it. So continue to believe the analysts who are walking you down the plank to the slaughter house, but why not ask that question of them. So we do now have the product that will supplant Intel from its leadership role, how do we actually build enough of that product to reach these lofty sales goals. It takes years and billions of dollars to build foundries, so you think they will be able to capitalize on this great, new product in time before Intel comes up with their alternative. I didn't want to bore you with the details Yin, but what you are saying is no different than what was said in the mid 90's, AMD did actually have products that were very competitive, but they lacked the manufacturing capacity to supply the demand, it is no different today. Maybe you should look to China to produce them? Then that would be the end of your great, new product, a Chinese chip supplier would have the same component available in six months at half the price. Good luck to you, not sure if you truly understand the dilemma that AMD has and will always have. While technically Intel is not a monopoly, the ability to create/maintain the manufacturing capacity to supply the customer demand of your product essentially creates its own form of a monopoly, it also creates that barrier to entry to keep new entrants from trying to enter the market.

4648,"Intel 30% yield ! $intc“AMD Zen 2: Production yields for Ryzen 3000 Dies at 70 percent “by Hilbert Hagedoorn on: 04/22/2019 08:08 AM | source: bitsandchips | AMD Zen 2: Production yields for Ryzen 3000 Dies at 70 percentWhenever you fab a wafer with CPU/GPU dies (or whatever they are fabbing), there are always defects. So if a wafer has 200 CPUs dies and 50 are functional, your yield is 25%. Well, the yield of the Zen 2-cores should be good, roughly 70 percent of the chips are fully functional. When AMD started original ZEN at 14nm, that was number was 80%, so they are not that far off in this early stage of fabrication. in a report from bitsandchips that number is 70 percent, which is not perfect, but good. The site relies on ""unspecified sources"" though, but has been proven reliable in the past.The small die size of the Zen 2-core is estimated to be 88 mm² and seems to be the helping factor opposed to designing big monolithic chips. For example, Intel's XCC-Die with 28 cores, according to chatter, for a fully functional chip shows only 35 percent in yields. If you keep that thought in mind, the upcoming Threadripper also would yield at 70% as it uses the same CPU dies added together in a chiplet design. So that's twice the yield of Intel.Unfortunately, there's no official word on clock frequencies and prices just yet, we can't wait to hear the official announcements, which are expected at the AMD keynote starting at Computex late in May.",0.9589

China is not stupid enough to target and hurt them either, because there is no other non-US replacement, unless they want to go back to use abacus (computer is a glorified calculator).Sure, China can impose tariff on US tech products, say Apple iPhone because they have Huawei or even Korea's Samsung for their consumers. China can also target PC makers like HP and Dell, because they have Lenovo but it has Intel/AMD/Nvidia inside. China can even target PC components like memory (Micron), disk drive/SSD (Western Digital, Seagate) because they can get memory from Samsung/SK Hinix, or disk from Hitachi, Toshiba. However, there is just no other way around for CPU/GPU.Since CPU/GPU are critically needed anyway and I can't imagine the Chinese wants to slow down to build out their data center, cloud infrastructure, super computer/HPC, AI, Smart City and etc, they can pledge to increase the purchase of ""American's"" goods, GPU/CPU, to reduce the trade imbalance and appease Trump. That is the positive impact.Don't let the pundit's ""generalization"" of tariff on tech companies/gadgets scares you. Dig deeper, CPU and GPU are irreplaceable American crown jewels.",0.9753

This is very unusual because server always gets the newest and fastest cpu. This is why AMD EPYC 7nm is going to come out for server first in early 2019.The answer to this is that the client cpus will still be the old  meltdown and other security ridden architecture if it comes out at all because intel knows it can’t deliver this old architecture to the datacenter server. Instead it is trying to buy time while former AMD Ryzen architect Jim Keller designs, develops, tests, validates, betas, vets, and finally volume produces a new mcm architecture similar to AMD’s which will take 2 to 3 years and will have to risk AMD lawsuits over patents and intellectual property rights.So think in combination witg the intel only hyperthreading foreshadow security issue that lowers Xeon performance by 30% what this means for intel datacenter sales in 2019 and 2020..“On Thursday, during the company's second-quarter conference call, Intel executives said that they would deliver 10nm during the second half, later clarifying that they would ship consumer PC systems in time for the holidays.

5114,"Thought about articulating my thoughts in Intel GPUs about to be released next year, Xe-LP GPU in particular.First, an overview of mobile gaming market:Mobile Gaming is fastest (+24% in 2020) growing segment in gaming industry and expected to show similar growth in 2021 (as per marketwatch, link below).A big reason why mobile game revenue is expected to widen its already large lead over console- and PC-based games in 2020 is a matter of economics. Mobile phones, which serve as the primary online connection for billions of people world-wide, can be cheap — or free with a usage plan — unlike dedicated gaming consoles such as Sony’s PlayStation 5, Microsoft’s new Xbox line and Nintendo Co.’s 7974, -0.05% NTDOY, -0.47% Switch, which can run from $300 to $500 before supply-constrained markups.In addition, 5G will be a major boost for mobile gaming not just because of bandwidth (upto 1Gbps) but mainly because the latency of 5G networks is much lower (at around 25ms) which is very important for gaming. Mobile gaming's biggest market is China, Tencent and Netease hold 50% market share there. In general mobile gaming is (and will be ) more widespread in Asia (Korea, JP) which also happen to be having best 5G coverage to enable that. And of course, Google, Apple and others also have their mobile gaming service.How is Intel positioned to capture this growing market? Intel's H3C XG310 Server Graphics cards are very promising as their TCO is lower than nVIDIA's solution.From the WCCftech article:One particular use case that truly showcases the power of using multiple GPUs on a single card is cloud gaming. One Intel Server GPU (H3C XG310) can stream up to 60 resource-intensive android games (or up to 90 light-weight ones) at 720p 30 fps. Up to the theoretical limit of 4 cards, this becomes a maximum of 240 android games being streamed per configuration - which is a very impressive total and according to Intel, constitutes a lower TCO (total cost of ownership) than NVIDIA-based solutions - primarily due to the synergy between Intel Xeon and Intel Server GP.And the customer is Tencent right now, biggest player in China (same article).I will post the links in the replies.Also, Intel's monster HPC/Server GPU currently (sampled in labs right NOW!) is capable of 42TFLOPs of FP32 as opposed to nVIDIA's 21 for Ampere (their most powerful) and AMD's around 22 TFLOPs.In summary, Intel is well poised to exploit GPU market for booming mobile gaming and its higher end GPUs will leave AMD and nVIDIA behind by a wide margin once released.Wish you all a happy new year!!>> https://www.marketwatch.com/story/videogames-are-a-bigger-industry-than-sports-and-movies-combined-thanks-to-the-pandemic-11608654990?siteid=yhoof2>> https://wccftech.com/intel-server-gpu-h3c-xg310",0.9983

5219,Hello IBM longs. I don't own ibm's shares but i wanted to post here about a possible big play for ibm in hybrid cloud at both enterprise and shared cloud infrastructure. Leveraging unique ibm's position in the enterprise that actually runs IT operation for big enterprises. It's nothing integrated as anyone else has with Microsoft and Amazon clouds. Ibm's $34B Redhat buy play well into this as well as AI Watson Cognitive analytics deap learning etc.This has to do with $amd GPUs and CPUs integrated in a way $nvda and $intc cannot achieve. Ibm's Power processors aren't going to make it because nvidia wasn't a good partner for ibm ripping off the price. Hence ibm has not won the supercomputer bid with Pathfinder DOE initiative. Cray has with AMD Frontier win. Intel won by default because 1. They were late in previous phase cancelling Knights GPUs and 2. DOE needs 2 wins of which ibm could make it. So I've posted a number of posts related to ibm and amd. Including ibm's general manager of cloud infrastructure saying in a video last Sep in Rome the advantages of using amd's EPYC processors including for AI and machine learning. Also recent moves of key ibm's Power processors technical and executive leadership to AMD putting in charge of amd's GPUs re to machine learning and tight CPUs and GPUs integration. Cannot happen without ibm's agreement as these people have ibm's confidential info on processors and AI related to ibm's IP. So ibm said in Sep they will reveal details of cloud computing with AMD EPYC this Q. If so i think big impact to push ibm and amd higher shares price! Please do comment if you're familiar with ibm's plans etc! Thanks.,0.9961

Sorry to see it, but, Brian brought this on himself and INTC. They did the same thing with the FPU bug back in 1995. Intel will eventually have to replace every chip that customers demand without the flaw. They tried to ignore the FPU issue and eventually replaced every one that customers, including me, demanded. What I couldn't understand is why they demanded my credit card and billed me $900 until I mailed them the old chip. They thought it would create a secondary market with the old FPU chips. I'm sure they're thinking the same thing; however, it will be over a year before they have a replacement chip. The cost will be enormous. This will require special charges in the billions, not counting the special charges for litigation. I suspect they'll have to eliminate the dividend for the next couple years to pay for it, otherwise, they'll drain all the cash with these charges. OMG, they can borrow, but, that will make things even worse, credit downgrades will destroy the bondholders. Da Bear Cares [CGDGE] Folks, this is not a good time to hold this stock, as long term INTC holders already know. I think this stock may settle under $20 before all these issues are resolved.

More people will be working, shopping and getting educated from home than ever before. This means more servers, which INTC has a near monopoly. 3.

To be honest, I was considering closing my position, or at least a part of it.Lion's share of my holdings are in Intel!A personal thanks to JayN for keeping the morale high all along!I believe this is just the beginning, here is why:DCG: Intel still holds more than 90% share in servers and WILL continue to hold that share. Ice Lake is due shortly and competition is stuck in supply issues. Intel will make a decision on Fab one way or other and future products like sapphire rapids with pcie5 and Optane will be extremely competitive. As per EEtimes (and other reports), Cloud Capex is going to stratosphere. Intel held 98% market share in servers in Dec 2020!PC: Tiger lake is already doing very well as also evident from the fact that Intel did better than forecast last quarter. Also, with upcoming Alder lake promising massive architecture improvement (on 10nm), things will only get better. It should also be kept in mind that supply constraints of competition will not abate till 2021 and Intel will be on much stronger footing by then.Fab: There is a good reason to believe they have improved 10nm yield significantly as per latest statement and also 7nm will be as per last announced schedule. dGPUs: Intel is supposed to be using TSMC enhanced 7nm for its GPUs which is going to give a run for money to its competitors. Intel is going to expand its revenue in this area in 2021 onwards. The dGPUs are already in lab and at 42TFLOPs of FP16, most powerful as of today. Gradually, Intel will also capture market for lower end/integrated GPUs (Iris Xe Max). The GPU SoC for android gaming employed by Chinese H3C and Tencent (biggest player in android games in China) show 50% reduction in TCO (total cost of ownership) with respect to nVIDIA Ampere as per Anandtech. This will be a huge market once games move to cloud with 5G.ADAS: Mobileye, which provided technology to tesla initially, has announced plans for robotaxis in 2022 and consumer grade ADAS by 2025. That's a HUGE market and even at a model of $15 monthly charge (like NIO is offering in China), this alone could rake in tens of billions of dollars. 8 out ten cars approved by European agency for ADAS use Mobileye solution including BMW, VW, Audi, Volvo, Nissan.With the arsenal of Optane, PCIE5 first mover advantage, Photonics, FPGA solutions for 5G, Intel is very well poised to ride the wave.The new CEO, an extremely competent ex-Intel engineer will put things in order fast and help Intel maintain lead.

The weight of this first-hand testimony, along with supporting government documentation and other evidence, established without any doubt the reality of these phenomena.

However given $intc failure to have 10nm servers and desktop chips this year as expected and pushing the 7nm to 2022 2023, he may want to wait for after the ER because it's clear cloud datacenters won't keep buying 14nm Intel's servers chips for another year. Plus Zen3 7nm+ EUV EPYC Milan coming out this year when even EPYC Rome can kill ALL market share as Intel has nothing. So from a humble 10% cloud datacenters market share to what? 80%+ is a huge jump for small AMD...with profound implications on its PT 12 months forward.

One of the cheapest ways to makemoney from the many new memory hungry technologies out there that have already gained strong momentum.What's nice about Micron now is that even with the strong gains which I have made and in many cases locked in such as option sales, I still see huge upside mostly because of the ridiculously low PE of around 6 and a forward PE that is in the 4's. And much much better growth numbers than most of the other major techs if not all of them.

5873,The proof is in the benchmarks guys. Only trust product reviews like those from Gamers Nexus and Jay. The IPC and fps is truly higher than anything on the market. AMD has done an excellent job with their Ryzen line and benchmarka like cinebwnch and multithreaded multicore performance is excellent bang for buck but Intel's 9700k and higher are being purchased by a large portion of consumers. If you livestream and play you may enjoy a 3900x or higher since it uses more resources. The other thing to keep in mind is that the IMC of the 10900k supports DDR4 ram above 4000 which means that you can open up a lot of performance with the newest line. As a consumer it's why I own both brands plus a 2080ti due to cpu bound scenarios at 1080p low settings where I need at least 240fps to even come close to winning a competition purse. From an investor's point of view we should understand this customer base that is price insensitive and needs IPC so this is one of the reasons why Intel has a strong consumer base in 2020-2022. The patents on their architecture are strong and entering the PCI GPU market which they will shortly will increase revenue and take some market share from Nvidia and AMD.,0.997

5927,"Well once again we have a Goldman Sachs analyst (Toshiya Hari ) putting a SELL rating on a quality company like Intel, referencing AMD as potentially taking market share from Intel's server business. Yesterday it was Mark Delaney, from Goldman Sachs, putting a SELL rating on Seagate Technologies, a company that recently beat above and below the line estimates and raised guidance for the rest of the year.Now Goldman is recommending to SELL Intel and buy AMD, even though they missed recommending AMD months ago before the rapid rise in the price of AMD stock (Way to go).If one looks at the financial statistics for both companies, Intel is clearly the long-term winner based on the following: 1) A comparison of valuation metrics shows Intel's current and forward P/E ratio (which is well below market multiples) is 17.6 and 11.4, vs. AMD's P/E ratio of 66.1 and 30.3. 2) Intel's Price/Book ratio is 3.2 vs. AMD's 21.2. 3) Intel's revenue is 10 times that of AMD at $66.2B vs. $6.4B. 4) Intel's net income is 2 times AMD's total revenue!, and 5) Intel has a broader range of products (e.g., processors, memory, networking, WiFi, storage, and programmable logic (Altera's FPGA business), to name a few, vs. AMD's processor and graphics chip lines of business (which I might add AMD's graphics are a far second to Nvidia).As a reminder, Intel just took the Apple iPhone modem chip business from QualComm and is active in AI chips for deep learning as well as SSD memory modules; all lines of business AMD is not directly in.Once again it appears that Goldman Sachs may have their own agenda for putting a SELL rating on a quality company like Intel, perhaps to drive the company stock down short term to the benefit of Goldman and their clients.I find it amazing that both Mark Delaney and Toshiya Hari, Goldman analysts covering tech and semiconductors, neither have any technical nor advanced degrees, either a BA in business or a BS in economics. Perhaps Goldman ought to consider hiring analysts that have some technical background so they can more fully understand the technology and the associated companies they are assessing.At the end of the day 7nm vs. 10nm vs.14nm feature sizes on silicon are not going to be the primary drivers of success in the semiconductor world.

IBM is to announce in Q1. This is more than just instances. It's hybrid cloud with enterprises. This explains why ibm's key technical leadership on such moved to AMD and are in charge of stuff related to the GPUs! Impact to $nvda and $intc is clear. Because of the tight integration between CPUs and GPUs amd is creating, enterprise customers will move to amd for both. Just like why cray Frontier supercomputer uses both GPUs and CPUs as I've posted Lisa Su explained because of such integration. This could benefit ibm too of course as ibm runs a lot of IT at big enterprises, it's at a position to replace legacy intel and nVidia servers with new amd's design in addition to the ibm's cloud side! It's a huge play where the $34B Redhat purchase can clearly help with developing the Linux operating system for clients of ibm's hybrid cloud and smooth transition.

By coming with chips including hardware patches for the many security exploits which use software patches today decreasing performance by 30% or more - Intel asks NDA signature before giving the patches not to publish any degradation of performance from these! So now as Intel has a few yeas anyway they redesign chips to close the exploits in hardware. That will eliminate software solutions today and appear the new 14nm chips are faster! But they just got back t square one as by then the comparison with AMD will use new 7nm Zen 2 products not 14nm old chips! From Intel's customers they will see gains on existing chips they use but compared with AMD the gap will increase drastically leaving Intel behind. This is all Intel can do only very few cloud customers will buy this. Hence even Dell had to upgrade its AMD's products to 10 from 3 as its customers refuse to buy Intel based products and would go to Dell's competition to get AMD's!

On Thursday, Intel reported adjusted second-quarter earnings per share of $1.06, above the 89-cent Wall Street consensus. Revenue of $16.5 billion beat expectations of $15.7 billion.The chip maker's 2019 guidance was also above full-year Wall Street expectations. Intel forecast 2019 sales of $ 69.5 billion and adjusted EPS of $4.40, versus the average analyst estimates of $68.5 billion and $4.23, respectively.What's new. Raymond James analyst Chris Caso on Thursday reaffirmed his Underperform rating for Intel ( INTC Loading... Loading... ) stock, arguing that better-than-expected PC chip demand may not last.""While near term numbers do move modestly higher, that's driven from one-time cost benefits and some demand pull forward which isn't likely to be sustainable,"" he wrote.In similar fashion, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis on Friday reiterated his Underperform rating for the chip maker, citing the resurgence of Advanced Micro DevicesCompetitive challenges loom,"" he wrote. Lipacis predicts AMD will take about 10 percentage points of chip share from Intel from now to the end of next year. Looking ahead. Caso doesn't have a price target for Intel shares.

I was much more knowable about EDS, the industry and I was brought in to advance EDS's growth initiatives while Bob was brought in as the CFO/cost-controller. What we determined with Bob was that he had very high credibility and was a solid cost-controller. HOWEVER, he was very week in technology and customer-facing matters. Thus, we kept him far in the background. I did take him on a couple CEO/CEO trips to give him some exposure but we mutually agreed his time was better spent back in the headquarters. My background is in high Finance (wharton MBA) but also ran numerous ""growth consulting initiatives for customers since the late '80s so I understand both the tech and Finance spaces. Bob, is just 1-2 steps below what INTC really needs to put INTC back on a growth curve. He's more of a ""shop floor controller"" (as labelled at EDS).

Intel's Ice Lake chips with avx512 showed no problems with power efficiency, and in fact outperformed AMD chips for the comparable laptop designs in Surface last year.3. Intel has demonstrated scalable gains in AI processing with the avx512 designs, especially with the dlboost 8 bit inference processing and the bfloat16 training processing. You can't deny these have been a factor in sales, especially in the case of FB requirements for bfloat16 in their Zion platform, for example.4. Intel already developed small Tremont core solutions without AVX and with its 6 wide out of order decode, so if no avx is the answer, Intel has a chip.5. Intel is extending Tremont with AVX2 simd in next year's Gracemont cores. These appear to present Intel's answer to the more-small-hammers processing of AMD chips. 6. Tremont cores were a fourth the size of Sunny Cove. You already see up to 24 Tremont cores in the P5900 5G base station products. It isn't hard to imagine a 128 Gracemont processor, if that is a required solution.7. We already see Alder Lake desktop chips on the roadmap that will offer varying numbers of Gracemont cores. These will be an interesting competitor for AMD's many small core avx2 limited chips. 8. Usual hyper-thread performance adds about 30% to the performance of a core, while a Tremont small core added about 50%.9. Gracemont addition of performance while doing AVX2 operations should be close to 100%, which is an interesting thought for the benchmarks. Use of AVX with hyper-threading sometimes actually decreases performance.https://www.pcworld.com/article/3569182/whats-wrong-with-intel-and-how-to-fix-it-former-principal-engineer-unloads.html",0.9915

In SiSoft Sandra now an entry can be spotted, this is an early engineering sample AMD Rome Epyc 2 processor running 64 cores and 128-threads (single CPU) at 2.2 GHz.The chip tested is the AMD ZS1406E2VJUG5_22 / 14_N which was planed into a Dell PowerEdge R7515 server. The proc is a qualification sample and perform close to the final performance aside from maybe the Turbo frequencies. Right now it is setup as 1.4 GHz Base with a boost to 2.2 GHz on all 64 cores. You can spot 64 x 512 KB L2 cache and 256 MB L3 cache. The second generation of Epyc chips is codenamed Rome and has a maximum of 64 cores and 128 threads by combining eight 8-core 7nm chips . ZEN2 will bring a higher ipc, smaller fabrication process and lower consumption.These processors are of course data-center products, but you know it, this architecture will end up in desktop processors. So far all it pretty interesting. AMD expects a 25% generational performance increase for the CPU cores. While that's not IPC, the theory is that one die package would be 25% faster. ZEN2 is not just a die-shink, it's a new architecture and based on chipsets. 7nm dies surrounding one 14nm IO chip in the center connected through AMD's Infinity fabric. The ""Zen 2"" high-performance x86 CPU processor core thus has a modular design methodology. An improved AMD Infinity Fabric interconnect links the separated pieces of silicon (""chiplets"") within a single processor package. This should solve some latency issues. The new processor also will support 8-channel DDR4 memory. Also, PCI-Express will be supported. Rome looks amazing, the dies are just so small.$INTC Https://www.guru3d.com/news-story/amd-rome-epyc-2-processor-64-core-(128-threads)-spotted-and-benched-in-sandra-(2-2-ghz).html",0.9963

As it turned out it had to fab a certain chipset at the 22 nm process – a step back from its current, insanely optimized, 14nm++ tech. There were also concerns that demand for Intel Xeon processors on the 14++ node is so high that ecosystems might actually move to EPYC if they are able to cater for them.

Also, for certain processes INTC appears to have more efficient algorithms for data centers. But, what I think will be the greatest advantage for INTC is their new Optane memory that will be available with Cascade Lake (14++ process) as well as 10 nm chips.

The company guarantees that the chip will operate the way it was designed. And they are doing exactly that.

There is a good analogy to this issue in military history. For centuries industrialized nations built vast naval fleets to project their military and political power around the world. The prevailing assumption among military leaders was that the only threat to the naval fleet was from another naval fleet. Then in the early part of the 20th century when aviation was still young an aviator named Billy Mitchell theorized that an airplane could carry a bomb and sink a large naval vessel, and then he proved it could be done. Does this mean the ships were designed incorrectly because there was a new of attacking a ship from the air? Absolutely not, it simply means the prevailing assumptions about the nature of attacks had to expand and adapt and they did.

We had another strong quarter of cloud adoption, highlighted by industry leader Amazon announcing new versions of their most popular EC2 computing instances powered by Epyc processors. Businesses can easily migrate their AWS instances to AMD and save 10 percent or more based on the technology advantages of our platform. Microsoft Azure also announced general availability of their AMD based storage instance in the quarter, as well as a new HPC instance powered by Epyc processors that is 33 percent faster than competitive X86 offerings.”Su called out some HPC system wins, including clusters based on Epyc processors going into Procter and Gamble, the US Department of Energy (the NERSC-9 “Perlmutter” system), and the University of Stuttgart, and notably a system at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory that employs both Epyc processors and Radeon Instinct GPU accelerators that will be employed for data analytics and machine learning workloads. While there has been a fair amount of tire kicking and testing among enterprise customers and HPC centers said Su, it is the hyperscalers and cloud builders who are driving the shipments of Epyc processors at this point, and it is these same customers who will be at the front of the line for the Rome Epycs, which are socket compatible and which will provide a big bump in performance when they are launched in the middle of this year and ramp in the second half.“As we look into 2019, I would expect that the early Rome deployments will also be cloud based,” said Su. “It will be the first ones, but we have a strong set of enterprise platforms.",0.9912

6868,"The reason why Intel has a problematic 10nm node is that Intel chose to use DUV+SADP instead of EUV (what TSMC uses) to manufacture 10nm. EUV is a more advanced etching technology which allows the etching to become more precise. When Intel started at 10nm, EUV was not ready yet. So Intel had to come up with a clever workaround on DUV, namely Self Aligned Double Patterning, which allows them to apply the older technology to newer nodes (10nm). But the workaround is not perfect; etching the wafer multiple times simply causes the edge to blur and increases defects. TSMC started on 10nm later, and they went ahead with the newest technology at the time, I.e. EUV. Note that Intel has access to EUV now as well, and they've pledged to switch back to EUV for their 7nm and 5 nm node. EUV, combined with Intel’s experience on multi-patterning technology, will allow Intel to push much faster towards newer nodes (5nm and 3nm).

Did you also hear about Google using AMD for their Gaming Cloud, not to mention the many other fortune 100 and 500 companies turning to AMD. It seems none of AMD'S customers projected a slowdown due to China and nor did AMD. 2018 Microsoft blamed intel for not having very stellar results because intel couldn't produce the chips. I told everyone they wouldn't allow that to happen 2 quarters in a row, guess what? they didn't allow it to happen and the way they prevented it was buying AMD chips. China was a convenient excuse for intel, but no one else is using China for an excuse, just intel. By the way, you wonder why AMD people post on intel board, you and bobbysue, drool, jayn and the rest coming here to post your drivel, is the reason we return the favor.

Intel execution will improve under Pat there is no question about it but the competition is not the same and is executing like a Swiss clock.Intel is a value play but investors will have to get the confidence that things are on track to be able to push the stock much further.

Except that AMD stated a modest 10% market share by Q2 this year. However this will obviously be more leading to triple beats.Intel also saying there is ""progress better than expected"" in 10nm fab. We've heard about this ""progress"" since 2015 every year. Butnotice nothing about commitment the large scale production to start in say Q2 or so. Just smoke and mirrors ""progress"" so let's look at this in 2021 shall we?Read the rest. AMD is the real thing coming next week. Intel has a mix of other chips such as storage i.e. SSD Optane now a combined sub unit in Intel's recent reorganization to hide the net fall in CPUs sales. Storage is doing well and Intel is selling that as is Micron, Samsung, WD etc. But the highest margins are the CPUs not commodity storage chips. As you've noted, Intel's gross margins dropped significantly because in their mix the CPUs revenues are down even as lower margins storage revenues were up. Same with 2020. So the net is overall growth is flat with lower margins. Horrible guidance! I'm very sure $intc will dive even if it takes a few days to see way higher revenues and margins outlook from amd's ER next week. Even as amd has consoles chips at lower margins than datacenters chips, everything is up including margins for consoles plus bigger market share in datacenters. Let's see... watch the VOLUME for both Intel and AMD.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-results/intel-signals-2020-will-be-a-turnaround-year-for-chip-industry-leader-idUSKBN1ZM30P",0.9645

7427,"""Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Stock Is Back in a Big Way"" And this is not counting EPYC server !!!SmarterAnalyst Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has consistently gained CPU share since the launch of Ryzen series CPUs, and indications from various sell-side checks suggests that AMD has gained market share versus Intel in laptops, and Chromebooks. However, GPU revenue might take a while to recover until the full roll-out of Vega series GPUs with Turing capable features like Ray-tracing, and AI similar to the RTX line-up for Nvidia series cards. Despite the choppy indications when pertaining to financial results, AMD is recovering from a really low base of revenues when compared to peers, and with a steady slate of products anticipated to launch in the next two-quarters, the sentiment tied to the stock could still improve from here.Despite the mixed-implications for market share gains for AMD in Q1’19, there were a number of notable positives from a report released by Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland: ""AMD takes share in notebooks and Chromebooks as Intel shortages likely accelerate share gains. AMD laptop share was up +3.9% quarter-on-quarter to 11.7% in Q1’19! In Chromebooks, AMD goes from almost zero market share to 8% as we believe Intel fails to supply the low-end of the market. AMD desktop share remains flat in the quarter at 15% as we wait for 7nm in 2H19. Positive AMD, negative INTC. GPU attach rate in desktops now 33% as gaming desktops increased in Q1’19.

But more importantly was the EPS declining way more at amazing 32% lower EPS GAAP in FY20 vs FY19. Non GAAP was still down 13%.Why earnings were lower much more than revenues? This shows a fundamental problem with nVidia going forward! In 4Q of FY19, nVidia refused to provide the whole year ouylook for FY20. They didn't provide such outlook for the FY21 yesterday. It's in declining revenues AND EPS which is more alarming.In contrast you would think high price high margins datacenters GPUs showed an increase so the percentage of drop in EPS shouldn't be way bigger than the revenues drop. But this is EXACTLY what AMD forced nVidia to do. Cut prices accross the board not just midrange gaming GPUs we've seen but the datacenter crown jewels! This is BEFORE AMD is launching new high end nVidia's killer gaming GPUs and new Arcturus datacenter GPUs. Also before the INTEGRATED GPU CPU design with Zen3 EPYC Millan that will take control over the datacenter GPUs leveraging EPYC 7nm+ Zen3 Millan leadership over Intel to pull the GPUs into such.So i see VERY BAD outlook for nVidia in sharp contrast with AMD's outlook for the year. nVidia's spinning of even lower revenues for their current quarter guidance blaming on the Corona virus is a hint of what's coming this year. Intel in contrast at least mentioned competition pressure for their ER. Not mentioning AMD but it's obvious. nVidia's lowering analysts expectations to then ""beat"" while overall they decline revenues and earnings is criminal I think.Remember last year nVidia has issued a warning lowering their previous guidance for the quarter ? Then analysts lowered their expectations to end with a ""beat"". This is how Jensen operates. But yearly revenues and earnings cannot lie. It's down and will be further down this year not just the first quarter especially as amd's new products are launching. I suggest you consider selling nVidia and buying AMD. Numbers don't lie. It's worse than Intel's outlook that was flat for the year. It's declining this year as last. Remember this post don't be fooled by herd manipulation ponzy schemes.",-0.9571

Because it’s not a Spectre attack, none of Intel’s mitigations work on it. And, there may not be a software fix, Moghimi told the Register. “My personal opinion is that when it comes to the memory subsystem, it’s very hard to make any changes and it’s not something you can patch easily with a microcode without losing tremendous performance,” he said. “So I don’t think we will see a patch for this type of attack in the next five years and that could be a reason why they haven’t issued a [common vulnerabilities and exposures].”Intel’s response:“Intel received notice of this research, and we expect that software can be protected against such issues by employing side channel safe development practices. This includes avoiding control flows that are dependent on the data of interest. We likewise expect that DRAM modules mitigated against Rowhammer style attacks remain protected. Protecting our customers and their data continues to be a critical priority for us and we appreciate the efforts of the security community for their ongoing research.”",0.7054

7818,"Netlist (NLST) is ""largely overlooked"" Who’s/What’s Netlist?Netlist holds several patents in server, storage, and hybrid memory, as well as rank multiplication and load reduction.What’s goin on here (the main course anyways)?Netlist has been in litigation with Googs since 2009 over allegations that Googs infringed upon Netlist’s seminal 912 hardware patent. Netlist alleges that Googs infringed the patent by building servers using the 912 patent technology. Netlist sued Googs on December 2009 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. The judge in the case ordered a random cross section of servers to be examined which showed that Googs indeed was using technology described in the 912 patent. Googs then asserted that the patent was invalid. In 2010 Googs requested an Inter Partes Reexamination of the 912 patent by the USPTO’s (United States Patent and Trademark Office) PTAB (Patent Trial and Appeal Board). While the reexamination was going on the Northern District Court granted a joint request made by both companies to stay the 912 patent infringement lawsuit until the USPTO made its findings. On January 2019 the PTAB upheld the validity of Netlist’s 912 patent. In April 2019 Googs appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In June 2020 the US Court of Appeals upheld the PTAB’s decision on the validity of the 912 patent. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic Googs was granted a 6 month extension to decide if it wanted to appeal this decision to the United States Supreme Court. Googs did not choose to appeal. On February 16, 2021 Netlist moved to lift the stay in the Northern District of California so the patent infringement lawsuit could continue. The Court granted the request and ordered that both Netlist and Googs shall appear for a telephone Case Management Conference on March 11, 2021.So, what’s the big deal?Netlist has a seminal patent. A seminal patent is defined as a patent that describes an invention so impactful that it creates or shifts the technology space. Netlist believes that the teachings of the 912 patent can be found in various DDR3 and DDR4 server DIMMs (Dual Inline Memory Module) as well as future products that will be produced under the DDR5 server DIMM standards currently being established by the industry. Furthermore, Netlist asserts that the 912 patent enabled Googs to build servers with high capacity and rapid memory that allowed servers to store an entire Oracle database in memory which allowed lightning fast search results. The 912 patent played a large part in Googs dominance in search engine capability. Right now, it is not a question whether Googs infringed the 912 patent. That has already been established. Now, Googs is at the stage where it can settle with Netlist or go to a jury trial to determine damages.What are the damages? Are they substantial?Damages will take into account both the product itself (internal factors) and the environment (external factors) in determining pricing. In this case Netlist will argue that the 912 patent established Googs dominance in regards to their search engine, which allowed monopolist profits that funded Goog’s entire ecosystem. While at the same time, Goog’s infringement of the patent prevented Netlist from establishing itself in the server memory marketplace. Netlist will most likely seek billions in damages. Also, the prospect of treble damages is in play as Netlist will allege willful infringement on Goog’s part. The most likely scenario is Googs will settle the case rather than risk going in front of a jury. A settlement would include a large lump sum plus licensing of the patent going forward.Anything else going on?Yeah you bet! Netlist also sued Inphi for infringement of the 912 patent in the US District Court for the Central District of California. That case was also stayed pending the Court of Appeals decision, and now that the 912 patent was upheld it is expected Netlist will resume court proceedings once it is finished with the Googs case.Also, on March 2020 Netlist filed a patent infringement lawsuit against SK Hynix in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas based on the infringement of Netlist’s 218, 523, and 595 patents in SK Hynix’s RDIMM and LRDIMM server memory products. SK Hynix petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“CAFC”) to change the venue from Texas to California. This petition was denied and the case will be tried in Texas. The Markman hearing was set for March 4, 2021 with Jury trial set for July 6, 2021. The Western District of Texas is notorious for being very pro-patent holder friendly.$AMD $MU $QCOM",0.9996

Intel cannot even sell its fabs because no one will buy a fab built on a process that doesn't work! That means $10s of billions of capital investment needs to be written off as loses. Even if Intel funds other fabs to make its chips their own capital investment in fabs won't return revenues making its chips. Intel will pay full price to other. Accounting perspective means not just to forget about the dividend but to expect negative EPS. ..yes losses based on accounting rules and writing off capital. In addition to this their huge debt of $10s of billions will now be downgraded to junk level. This is more than just catching a falling knife thinking it's oversold. It's going to low $20s at best, possibly lower.Analysts will now issue sells downgrades with way lower PTs. It wasn't yet out Fri but will be for Monday bringing another sell wave. Institutions cannot hold with massive analysts downgrades forcing to sell. Implications and panic of the US losing fabs manufacturing leadership as attached analyst comments, will fuel retail selloff shares. It's worse than ibm's paying global Foundries to take its fab in return for commitment to make ibm's processors. Ibm's fab was working no disaster failure like Intel's. No one will buy Intel's fabs other than for scrap salvage of equipment. Playingwith fabs is very dangerous. Next to be exposed as hurting is $nvda ! Its move and failure to go to Samsung for 7nm isn't over yet. Ampere leaks are real and nVidia's won't be competition with amd's big Navi. TSMC's doesn't have the capacity for nVidia now hence its first launching would be with Samsung old 10nm+ marked as 8nm for hype purpose. It's not 7nm EUV even close as big Navi will use. So I'm expecting a sharp drop in nVidia's pps. ..Out of all this AMD emerges as the only choice and clear winner. Even before fab issues for both Intel's and nVidia's products, for which AMD assumed competition straight on with such. With fab issues it's not a competition anymore . Remember combined market cap of Intel’s and nVidia's is $500B vs AMD's $80B. Doubling AMD's is in aSHORT ORDER. Leading to breaking $100 PPS very quickly. nVidia's ER in less than a month...Just read the following analyst's writing.

It's only easier to increase product costs to offset if you are in monopoly, but with a competitor selling a superior product the consequences are severe. Intel may be down after their ER but it's hard to say because they increased their Cascade Lake price by 10% as is reported when they sell this to OEMs, but the OEMs in turn sell it to customers for 60% discounts. These discounts are not being shown as negative earnings but as marketing operational costs which are probably offset by firing, cost_cutting and laying off US workers.

Even if Intel just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem.
