It does seem that the odds on an acquisition have moved from 50-50 to 70-30 in AVGO's favor with a negotiated deal being about 50-50 (I wouldn't expect an announcement before Monday morning, but earlier would be wonderful).",0.8258

5,"Based on my study to QCOM, AMD, NVDA, and INTC, the following results can be concluded:1. 1 yr price for QCOM is $228 (low), $280 (average), and $465 (high).2. QCOM is the relatively cheapest stock among them on the basis of combining P/E, forward P/E, profit margin, revenue, quarterly revenue growth (YOY), and quarterly earning growth (YOY).3. The QCOM P/E is 23.28, which is similar to that of a traditional industrial stock. Based on this low P/E, high growth in both revenue (62%), and high earning (165%), I believe that Qcom will have a limited space to pullback even if the overall market continues to pull back.I believe that QCOM will have a 2:1 split soon.",0.9542

19,"Did the board fulfill its duty based on the following (feel free to comment but would appreciate thumbs up/down to conduct an informal survey):Duty of care. The duty of care requires that directors be informed and exercise appropriate diligence and good faith as they make business decisions and otherwise fulfill their general oversight responsibilities. When reviewing plans to sell a company unit or to buy or merge with another company, the board must exercise proper oversight of management, especially with respect to issues of strategy and compliance with legal obligations such as mandatory disclosures. Pricing is another important consideration, and boards should be wary of claims of synergy. Academic studies offer mixed opinions on the track record for merger returns. Some find positive returns compared to non-acquiring peers (Petrova and Shafer, 2010), especially for frequent acquirers (Cass Business School and Intralinks, 2014). Other studies, for example a recent Fiduciary Group study citing McKinsey, claim a 70% failure rate.Duty of loyalty. The duty of loyalty requires that a director act in the best interests of the corporation, including in the M&A context. Boards can maintain independence from an M&A transaction by appointing a standing committee of the board composed entirely of independent, non-conflicted directors to review the terms of a particular deal with the help of an independent third party, who can render a fairness opinion. (The National Association of Corporate Directors submitted an amicus curiae letter on this issue in May 2015.) For a substantive legal discussion of the board’s role in M&A transactions, see this article by Holly J. Gregory of Sidley Austin, which appeared in Practical Law (May 2014).",0.9988

The wording used in the stay is very indicative : 1) We are satisfied that Qualcomm has shown, at minimum, the presence of serious questions on the merits of the district court’s determination that Qualcomm has an antitrust duty to license its SEPs to rival chip suppliers.2) Qualcomm likewise has made the requisite showing that its practice of charging OEMs royalties for its patents on a per handset basis does not violate the antitrust laws.3) The fundamental business changes that the injunction imposes cannot be easily undone should Qualcomm prevail on appeal. 4) Indeed, the Department of Defense and Department of Energy aver that the injunction threatens national security, and the DOJ posits that the injunction has the effect of harming rather than benefiting consumers. https://essentialpatentblog.lexblogplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2019/08/2019.08.23-074-Order-Granting-Stay-of-Injunction.pdf",0.9482
83,what will qcom stock price be at the end of 2019? comment welcome.,0.6503
84,"Here is the reason why I thing QCOM will eventually win the court battle over Apple. QCOM won the same argument in courts in Europe a few years back against Nokia and will win it again this time because once the issue is dissected Apple has no case: Without QCOM essential patents there would not be a wireless internet access (at a meaningful speed) that would thrive the smart phone business. In other words all the smart phone manufacturers will not be where they are today (specially Apple) if it wasn't because of QCOM's breakthrough inventions in 3G and 4G. So the court judge will ask this question from a potential apple customer to determine who should win the court case. The question is:How much would you pay for an iPhone if it didn't have any wireless capability except through WiFi? Meaning you could only access the internet at home. If the answer is people still would pay the full price, then judge will vote in favor of Apple. But if they say they wouldn't pay anything, then judge will vote in favor of Qualcomm and grant permission for QCOM to continue with the existing model. In my opinion no one would buy an iPhone without a 3G/4G capability. And it is only fair for QCOM to be rewarded for their inventions in 3G/4G so they can continue funding the 5G and future technologies.Notice that this model was not invented by QCOM. It is also used by Nokia and Erickson and was blessed by the communication industry to increase the competition and keep the price of the chips low. That is why you pay only $40 for a QCOM snapdragon but you pay $300 for an intel chip. That is the proof that the system worked. Apple probably pays more for the plastic material it uses in iPhone than the money it pays Qcom for their breakthrough inventions in 3G/4G and the modem chips they use.",0.9926

Look at this...Chinese budget phone maker Honor said on Friday it had signed partnerships with major chip suppliers such as Intel and Qualcomm after being spun off from parent Huawei Technologies in the wake of U.S. sanctions last year.Huawei had sold Honor to a consortium of 30 of the sub-brand's agents and dealers in November to help it resume sourcing components restricted by the sanctions.As Chief Executive George Zhao launched the View40, Honor's first phone model since the split, Honor said in a statement it now had its own deals with some tech firms.These include AMD, MediaTek, Micron Technology, Microsoft, Samsung, SK Hynix, and Sony.""The last five months have been an extremely difficult but meaningful time for Honor,"" Zhao said. ""We feel the weight of expectation from industry partners and consumers.""Samsung and Hynix declined to comment, while Intel, AMD, Microsoft, Qualcomm and Micron did not immediately respond to requests for comment.One supplier source said Honor becoming a separate entity from Huawei was enough for suppliers to supply components.Under Huawei, Honor focused on the budget end of the phone spectrum, but it will aim to move into the middle and higher tier market and expand overseas, Zhao said.The company said it would pursue the 'internet of things' market, calling its strategy '8+1+N', the same term used by Huawei.""They wanted to show they are Huawei reborn so that customers can trust them to have the same quality Huawei was aiming for,"" said Nicole Peng, VP of Mobility at Canalys, a consultancy.Honor shipped 13.3 million phones in the third quarter of last year, making up just over a quarter of Huawei's total shipments, according to Canalys.Honor's roughly 8,000 staff have moved out of Huawei's offices to a new headquarters also in the southern city of Shenzhen. Around 50% were involved in R&D, Zhao said.The same day, a letter from Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei was posted on Huawei's employee messageboard, saying that the company would have to focus its R&D efforts and cut some products due to the U.S. action.Ren's letter was dated June, before the Honor sale.Tightening rounds of U.S. restrictions have choked off Huawei's access to advanced U.S. chip technology, damaging its phone business.

There is nothing brilliant about this, Andrew Carnegie was the master at this business maneuver over 100 years ago. In any event, Qualcomm is not considering doing away with Royalty structure and Apple knows it, so along with organizing and colluding with other Qualcomm customers to manipulate their input cost, along with withholding payment within a contract agreement with Qualcomm and giving Intel the source code of Qualcomm, Apple has shown it is absolutely ruthless at pushing our laws bounds in their mission to pound down all of their partners into subservient/controlled rolls in the wonderful world of Apple.

403,"Augmented reality (AR) glasses are one of the most talked about technologies of the future. The idea of taking the functionality of a smartphone and turning it into a hands-free, wearable device that can intelligently interact with the world around us is the goal for many. The path to that goal has proven difficult at times, and although companies continue to make progress, the often asked question is, how long until truly smart AR glasses become a reality?As with so many areas of emerging technology, it pays to listen to those involved in the silicon layer. Identifying the next major step in the semiconductor market can provide a clear insight into the world of tomorrow, as the next wave of devices will harness these chipsets and platforms for power and performance. That’s why I think the latest news from Qualcomm’s extended reality (XR) division is so significant.This week, the company announced a new reference design for AR viewer devices based on its Snapdragon XR1 platform. The design showcases a split-processing approach, meaning the viewer can share computing workloads with a host device, such as a smartphone or PC. In contrast, existing XR viewers, such as the Nreal Light device, don’t hold any processing power on-board, relying on the host device for its performance entirely.Why does this matter? Well, to return to the original question, I believe this is an important next step on the journey toward fully-fledged AR glasses, and the next generation of spatial computing. The split-processing approach will help to solve some of the problems facing today’s XR viewers, providing a stepping stone to even better devices and richer computing experiences.For example, a problem with today’s XR viewers is that the devices fully rely on a host for their power. Qualcomm says that the split-rendering approach, assisted by computing power within the viewer, will pave the way for XR viewers that use up to 30% less power overall than the current crop of devices — that’s a huge improvement.The additional processing power will also lead to new uses. For instance, users on a smartphone or a laptop should be able to run multiple virtual displays within their field of view, making it easier and simpler to engage with 2D content in XR. And, in time, newer 3D applications designed to take advantage of these devices will revolutionize the way we socialize, work and play together.Much like the way the virtual reality market is segmenting as it matures, with devices targeting a variety of uses, different AR device designs will play to different strengths. Simple viewers like the Nreal Light offer a lightweight, simple design for things like streaming content, whereas designs based on a split-processing approach will be more valuable to enterprise customers in the shorter term; Lenovo’s ThinkReality A3 glasses, launched at CES 2021 are an early example.Still, consumer uses like media consumption and gaming will emerge and find space in the market. And as we’ve seen in virtual reality, improvements come quickly in areas including displays, tracking and user interface, delivering continuously improving experiences that will roll down the price curve over time.Naturally, the next step will be taking this approach to a wireless design, a view shared by Qualcomm, which has said that this is the next step on its journey. The company has already achieved wireless split-processing in the virtual reality space with what it calls “boundless XR” technology. So realistically, once we see this distilled into AR devices, we’ll only be a half step away from powerful AR glasses that are indistinguishable from a pair of spectacles.As a result, it feels like the promise of AR glasses is sharpening into focus. As a major player helping to build the XR ecosystem, Qualcomm’s view of the future is clearer than most, and as the silicon provider of choice for major XR devices, it’s important to pay attention to its reference designs. I’d argue that this update gives us the best look yet at the future of AR, as well as the steps required to deliver truly smart glasses and the next generation of mobile computing.￼",0.9991

Apple has to compete so more sale bucks for QCOM!Top Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF Securities said in a note on Sunday that all three models of Apple’s 2020 iPhones will support 5G in order to better compete with 5G Android devices.In June, Kuo said only two models of Apple’s planned 2020 iPhones would ship with 5G support, while a third would only offer 4G LTE to help keep costs down. But competition against Android in the low-cost segment will force Apple to add 5G, Kuo said.“Apple has more resource for developing the 5G iPhone after the acquisition of Intel baseband business, ” Kuo said in his note. To be a so called top analyst, he has to know that the Apple modem chip business will be hard pressed to be producing their own Chips in one year, or maybe forever!! Most experts agree they are behind QCOM by 5 years or more! “We expect that the prices of 5G Android smartphones will decline to $249–349 USD in 2H20,” he added, noting that “consumers will think that 5G is the necessary function” by the time they’re launched.

Apple's move to fifth-generation wireless technology, or 5G, for its iPhone may take longer than some investors expect, according to UBS.The back story. Apple (ticker: AAPL) shares have rallied 23% so far this year through Tuesday as investor sentiment regarding its strategic shift to services has improved.Last week, the company unveiled an array of new paid services such as Apple TV+, a video-subscription offering; Apple Arcade , for gaming; and Apple News+, for news and magazines.But some analysts are also looking forward to the potential big upgrade cycle from a 5G-enabled iPhone in 2020. Samsung has already announced a 5G-enabled phone, which will be released this year.The shift to 5G is tremendously important to the technology industry. Analysts expect 5G to deliver 10 to 40 times the current speed of 4G LTE networks. Its lower latency promises to make possible new applications from augmented reality to cloud gaming.What's new. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri on Tuesday said Apple may not be able to launch a 5G iPhone by next year.There is ""increasing potential that AAPL may not be able to ship a 5G iPhone for 2020,"" he wrote. ""Barring settlement w/QCOM in the next few months, field work suggests Apple is increasingly in jeopardy of being unable to ship a 5G iPhone in 2020."" Apple is embroiled in a patent dispute with Qualcomm (QCOM) over technology used in the company's phones. Apple stock was 0.5% higher at $194.89 early on Wednesday. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for commentThe analyst said he thinks Intel (INTC) won't be ready to produce a 5G modem for Apple by 2020, and that he doubts Samsung will want to sell Apple a 5G modem.Looking ahead. Arcuri reaffirmed his Buy rating and $215 price target for Apple shares, saying the smartphone maker will still be able to increase its iPhone sales over the long run due to demand from people seeking to replace their phones.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.com",0.9951

The analyst views this as a modest positive for Qualcomm given he expects Qualcomm to gain an incremental share at Huawei on 4G handsets. It's unlikely this license will represent a source of near-term upside to estimates, but likely to be modestly incremental next year, Vinh says. Longer term, Vinh believes Qualcomm is likely to be better positioned if only 4G-related licenses are granted to Huawei given its stronger footprint at other OEMs. The analyst made no change to his Overweight rating or $175 price target.",0.9867

We remain sidelined until model implications become clearer.”Citi: Neutral rating, $55 target“We believe the deal could be positive for Qualcomm given the restoration of licensing and chipset revenue and we estimate the deal could total an additional $7.0 billion and $1.55 EPS accretion to our C20 revenue and EPS estimates of $22.5 billion and $3.57 respectively. We expect Qualcomm’s other customers will pursue similar royalty and chipset pricing if Apple gets a good deal.”Bernstein: market perform rating, $60 target“The resolution caps a multi-year period in which Qualcomm’s stock has broadly been viewed as virtually uninvestible, and the resolution will likely go a long way toward assuaging investors who have been terrified of the potential for negative legal and regulatory outcomes.”Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Neutral rating, $71 target“We think the risk of changing the model to component-based licensing is muted now and going forward, the stock could start tradingon its own fundamentals of strong semiconductor and licensing businesses. On the negative side, the impending FTC decision adds some risk to Qualcomm and the stock’s 28% positive move yesterday (vs SP500 +0.05%) mitigates our enthusiasm.”Morgan Stanley: Equal weight rating, $55 target“We think this settlement is a significant win for Qualcomm and results in a similar, if not better, outcome to a scenario we laid out in January, which would have been reached had Qualcomm achieved a win at the FTC … We think settlement with Apple provides Qualcomm some leverage with other handset OEMs to ensure future royalty compliance.”",0.9973

542,"5G Technology May Be in Use by 2021Qualcomm also made some big splashes at CES this year, where Ford and Qualcomm announced a partnership to study cellular V2X technology. That may have been a significant victory in the push to promote cellular. As recently as April 2017, Ford was telling federal regulators that it agreed that “DSRC is the only proven communication technology currently available that meets latency and availability requirements” for these systems. Only eight months later, Don Butler, Ford’s executive director of connected vehicles, said that technologies including 5G and cellular V2X are “fundamental to support our vision for connected cars.”Qualcomm’s cellular V2X chips are expected to be deployed commercially next year, and Duggal says they could be underpinned by 5G technology to be commercially deployed by 2021. In vehicles, Duggal says, 5G will give these connected systems longer range, better reliability, and lower latency than either DSRC or the LTE-based systems in today’s cellular V2X chips. Should its products underpin the arrival of 5G in automotive uses, Qualcomm’s role in the industry will only expand. A 2017 report from consulting firm IHS Markit suggests that 5G connectivity may enable $2.4 trillion in economic output across the automotive sector by 2035",0.9914

Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. and Reliance Jio Platforms (Jio) along with its wholly owned subsidiary Radisys Corporation today announced their expanded efforts to develop open and interoperable interface compliant architecture based 5G solutions with a virtualized RAN. This work is intended to fast track the development and roll out of indigenous 5G network infrastructure and services in India.Now todays news from ET is that India's telecom sector is expected to see some major developments in 2021 which will fuel the growth for all telecom operators such as spectrum auction, likely launch of 5G services, Open RAN adoption, among others. This hopefully could be the signal indicating a major rollout of ground systems that I hope might be be awarded to QCOM ((((or at the very least a significant piece of the equipment orders)))) in a market that could eventually rival China's in size. Adding to my belief / hope is that the border tensions between India and China and China's ongoing spying has led to the barring of certain Chinese companies like Huawei and almost all Chinese created APPS that might allow access to data in India .Todays news as written below is also indicating the 2nd half of 2021 for initial 5G launch which I believe may be the next major escalation in sales. Recently at the India Mobile Congress 2020 (IMC 2020), Reliance Jio chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani said Jio would take the lead in launching 5G in India in 2H21 using in-house 5G hardware.

Like when we think about our relationship with Apple, we are very happy.We have restored the relationship. We are developing great products together. And the way we think about it, we don’t make any heroic assumptions on our business with Apple. We think about it, that is a business that is going to be very stable, much like our business with Samsung.Samsung has gone and developed their own platform. I would say they have more assets than Apple does to do it. They have an infrastructure business, which is growing. They have a semiconductor business in very large scale. And they have built a solution, and we have built a very stable relationship over the years as we continue to move technology forward to about a 50% share, give or take, within Samsung.That is how we think about Apple. And I’m sure they are a great company. They are going to be focused on developing the platform. And if they succeed, there is always going to be room for a company like Qualcomm driving the premium technology. I think companies that they go into the vertical transition, they look at optimizing building materials.They look at how to have a common platform they can use in a number of devices from phones to watches to different things, and Qualcomm will continue to be focused on driving the modern technology for. That is the number one core competence of the company. That is what we do for a living.The other way for you to think about it, we also were very excited. We don’t want to speculate or making any disclosures, but I’m telling you, we are very excited about rebuilding the relationship with Apple and opportunities to expand you, we are very excited about rebuilding the our relationship even to other products beyond the modem, for example, to RF front end.So I think we are just the beginning of our journey with Apple, and we are very happy with the relationship.

Apple currently is using Intel for the iPhone modem, it stops using the Qualcomm chips in its IPhone. It had maintained a dual supplier relationship (QCOM and Intel) for quite some time until Intel could stand up on its own). Apple has to slow down the QCOM chips iPhones to make both phones have similar performance. Intel has really made strides in the development in mobile chips, and its almost caught up with QCOM in the LTE world. Broadcom is supplying the RF components to the iPhone, and it has a great relationship with Apple. If Broadcom successful buys QCOM, and IF Hock Tan cuts a sweet deal with Apple to 1.cut licensing costs, 2. Be the exclusive supplier for both modem chips and RF components to have a seamless integration in the iPhone, this would be a major threat to Intel’s mobile communication’s revenue.For the reasons listed above, I do think Intel WILL need to do something to disrupt the potential edge that AVGO would have in buying QCOM, and I think it has been brainstorming on what to do, and the rumor that AVGO is being targeted by Intel is probably an internally leak from its behind the door brainstorming.

719,"Qualcomm (QCOM) - has had quite a run since its March 23, 2020 low and investors are right to look through what will be a less exciting 2020 than initially thought, according to one analyst. Qualcomm is up 30% since that low, but still down for the year as earnings for 2020 have been revised lower on account of coronavirus. Semiconductor stocks have enjoyed a big run up and, like many stocks in the U.S. market, are now trading at elevated valuations on next 12 month’s earnings. Although part of the reason is lowered interest rates, investors are looking for a sharp recovery into the end of the year. But Qualcomm now trades at 17 times 2020 earnings per share, using FactSet consensus estimates, compared to its recent average of roughly 16 times. The reason: 2021 is looking to be a strong year, especially as 5G handsets make their way through production and into the hands of users around the globe. “Despite the near-term uncertain smartphone supply-and-demand environment, Qualcomm is well positioned to benefit from the long-term 5G investment cycle and anticipate recovering earnings in 2021 as 5G smartphones ramp, Apple reenters the model for QCT [a business segment] shipments, and global demand for smartphones improves,” wrote Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley in a note after hosting a meeting with management. Economic activity is expected to recover in the second half of 2020, a trend currently looking much sharper in China than in the U.S. Excluding a second wave of virus outbreaks, this looks to be on track. Walkley is looking for 5G handset volumes between 175 million and 225 million in calendar year 2020, not a far cry from previous 2020 estimates. Combined with other revenue segments, this would translate to about $20.25 billion in sales for Qualcomm. But investors are more concerned with 2021 results and Walkley sees Qualcomm taking market share from other players in 5G chip sales in 2021, as the company is producing a powerful chip. Walkley is looking for revenue in 2021 to grow 29% to $26 billion, suggesting profit margins may expand too.Walkley also points out that Huawei, which the White House is disallowing from buying U.S.-made chips, does not represent much revenue for Qualcomm. According to research from Alliance Bernstein analysts, Huawei only accounts for roughly 5% of global semiconductor purchases. And according to CFRA analysts, Huawei only comprises roughly 3% of Qualcomm’s revenue, allowing other revenue streams to outweigh Huawei’s impact. Walkley has a $102 price target on Qualcomm shares, implying a 16.9 times multiple on his 2021 earnings forecast of $6.02 a share. Pre-virus, 5G-exposed chip makers were indeed trading at elevated multiples compared to their histories because the multi-year 5G ramp was expected to bring strong revenue and earnings growth. Walkley’s price target reflects 30% upside. Risks to the thesis on Qualcomm: stronger 5G competition from other makers or another virus crisis, disabling suppliers from building and consumers from buying, although the latter argument is rebutted by the industry’s position that 5G devices would be highly beneficial during a pandemic period.",0.9987

Intel announced on late Tuesday it will exit the 5G smartphone modem business.In similar fashion, Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay on Tuesday reaffirmed his Outperform rating for Qualcomm shares after the Apple settlementWe believe shares remain undervalued even after [Tuesday’s] 23% move,” he wrote. “Our checks have consistently pointed to Qualcomm’s ~1-year+ technological leadership in 5G modems versus peers.”Looking ahead. Cassidy raised his price target for Qualcomm to $100 from $57, while Ramsay increased his target to $91 from $70.The back story. On Tuesday, the companies announced they reached a six-year license agreement, effective April 1, and a multiyear chipset supply agreement.

861,"Despite all the smoke and mirrors and noise QCOM is moving ahead with plans and launching new production in Vietnam.Qualcomm Expands 5G Development Via New Facility In VietnamBy Ramish Zafar / Jun 20San Diego, California-based chip giant Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), like other American companies, is caught in the middle of the trade war between the United States and China. The bulk of the modern tech industry's products are assembled in China due to easy access to labor and other incentives provided by local authorities. Additionally, the East Asian country's massive population also ensures that not all products that are assembled there are exported to foreign markets, with a big chunk of them also being consumed locally.Nevertheless, a souring of ties between the U.S. and China has caused several big tech giants to look for contingencies to their operating plans in the off event that affairs go fully south. With this in mind, we've got more information today for Qualcomm's research and development plans for its modems and other smartphone radio front-end chips for current and next-generation cellular technologies.Qualcomm Snapdragon 875, Next-Gen Modem Based on 5nm Node Reportedly Go Into Production at TSMC FacilityQualcomm Opens New R&D and Testing Facility In Hanoi, Vietnam For Modem and Radio Front-End ChipsThe information is courtesy of a new report published on the Vietnamese website 24h, and it reveals that the facility is located in Hanoi, Vietnam. Its purpose is to assist Qualcomm in developing new cellular technologies and to allow the company's local manufacturing partners to test out their products.Within the testing center, Qualcomm will also look to developing image sensing applications ion addition to focusing on radio front-end modules for smartphones. Three sub-facilities, which include a radio frequency (RF) laboratory, a laboratory designed to test power consumption and performance metrics (PPT) and a laboratory designed to adjust image sensors and gauge the quality of sensor results.Given that Qualcomm does not produce camera sensors, the term 'image sensor' as available in the translation of 24h's report refers to either the company's image signal processors (ISPs) that are integrated within a Snapdragon system on chip (SoC) or to Qualcomm's virtual fingerprint recognition sensors that also take the image of a user's appendage for security verification.￼￼Qualcomm's Snapdragon 7nm 5G modem (right) and the QTM 525 mmWave antennas pictured. The QTM 525 is crucial in allowing the San Diego chip giant to maintain a lead over its 5G competitors. (Image Credit: Qualcomm Incorporated)While the report does not explicitly state whether Qualcomm will also test 5G chips in the facility, it's clear that the next-generation cellular standard will play some role in the plant. One of Qualcomm's partners in Vietnam, VinSmart research and production, has already entered into a partnership with Qualcomm and Fujitsu to manufacture 5G smartphones in Vietnam. This will be carried out in the Hoa Lac Hi-tech Park in Hanoi, and it will be powred bt a Snapdragon 5G modem and IP68 and power management features from Fujitsu.Yet, despite Qualcomm's decision to open a new plant in Vietnam, it's impossible for the company to move its modem fabrication facilities in the country as well. Right now only Samsung (in Korea) and TSMC (in Taiwan) have the technical capability needed to print circuits on the level of minuteness required for a bleeding-edge 5G modem.To that end, TSMC is expected to commence producing orders for its advanced 5nm manufacturing process soon, and one of the customers is rumored to be Qualcomm. The outbreak of the coronavirus has put a dent in the San Diego-based company's high hopes for 5G market demand, and performance of upcoming products including Apple Inc's new smartphones will determine the consumers' mood towards next-generation connectivity standards at a time when purchasing power is shrinking and the need to work and study from home is rising.",0.9982

R&D around the components is ver expensive, the main reason Intel dropped out and sold business. Apart from that, Samsung and Huawei but also Mediatec have been able, to use their own (inferior) components. Apple did virtually everything to scare possible inventors and hopefully, the FTC case is over soon to ensure proper enumeration for inventors again. Q is used to competition, but the Apple / FTC initiative was the real thread to Q and to innovation in general. If licensing on component level becomes the norm, innovations will be possible for Apple, Samsung and Huawei...this was always the target of these companies (and the FTC supported this initiative).

During the FTC trial Apple was saying that 1.50 USD would be a fair and reasonable price for all SEP and non SEP licenses, whilst Q wants to charge 7.50 USD (applying the cap if 400 USD per device). If the San Diego Jury determines 1.58 USD (Q position in the court) or 1 USD or 0.5 USD or 0.1 USD for the 3 patents concerned, how can the whole portfolio of patents (> 100.000 patents) be worth 1.50 USD ?

One has to sign license agreement and agree to the price if you want the chip. Apple didn’t want to pay $7.50 but wanted to pay only $1.50 so qcom didn’t sell the chip to them ... how is this unfair? I don’t think $1.50 would have covered cost of research and development and qcom would be going out of business.Apple operating chief Jeff williams say something like he felt there was gun to his head... I guess Apple shouldn’t have tried to steal from qcom. Second, Shapiro idea of fair is in-fact unfair. Technology leader is leader through technological innovation and good engineering. He mentioned something like Qualcomm should be commended for its technological achievements but companies who aren't quite as good or who don't have the scale are not impeded from trying to catch and threaten and challenge the leader. Who aren’t quite good? Should be allowed to catch up?

Since Apple now sells 5G-compatible devices, the upgrade cycle has begun in earnest. With 5G offering speeds exponentially higher than that of 4G, most users will likely upgrade at some point.Qualcomm benefits because it is the only maker of a critical 5G chipset. This should remain true for at least the foreseeable future. Last year, Qualcomm persuaded a court to overturn a ruling that Qualcomm was a monopoly.Apple also dropped its lawsuits against Qualcomm in 2019. However, it did buy Intel's smartphone chipset business, presumably to someday offer a competing product.One can understand why Apple wants a piece of this market. This business is so large that Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 63% through 2027.These increases have already begun to materialize. In its most recent quarter, adjusted revenue rose by 35% from the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings per share surged by 86% over the same period.Moreover, despite recent growth in Qualcomm stock, investors may not yet appreciate the value proposition. Even with the move higher, Qualcomm's forward P/E ratio stands at about 21. This is extremely cheap, especially considering the potential growth and Qualcomm's market position.Finally, as CEO Steven Mollenkopf retires, Qualcomm insider Cristiano Amon will take over the position.

1054,"Qualcomm’s Rf Business Is Under the Street’s Radar, Says 5-Star Analyst As the largest mobile chipmaker in the world, Qualcomm (QCOM) is expected to be one of the main beneficiaries of the upcoming 5G cycle. However, there’s a particular segment of Qualcomm’s business that gets less attention, but has gradually become more prominent. Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland recently spoke to Qualcomm’s resident RF expert, to discuss an “often-misunderstood piece of Qualcomm’s business model.” Qualcomm’s RF front end business – the components that turn the information into radio signals – grew by 50% year-over-year in the first quarter. Rolland estimates the segment makes up 10% of Qualcomm’s overall business, amounting to what is now a run-rate of $600 million. Looking further down the line, in the long term, Qualcomm sees RF making up 20% of the company’s business. The company has expanded its RF “revenue base” significantly, with recent technology advances in parts, such as power amplifiers, switches and antenna tuners. Furthermore, some 5G networks will be powered by mmWave – the tech which makes it possible to move massive chunks of data at high speed over unused high-frequency bands. Qualcomm’s “integrated approach” gives it a competitive advantage as it provides the performance required to “meet complexity challenges at high frequencies.” But 5G is not the only opportunity for the RF business, as Qualcomm is making strides in 4G, too. 5G is based on legacy 2G/3G/4G networks and Qualcomm has been able “to inherit legacy bands when winning 5G platforms at some customers.” Summing up, the 5-star analyst said, “Qualcomm has defined the cutting-edge cellular standard by consistently ‘moving the goal posts’ in baseband capabilities for the last two decades. Every time a competitor matches Qualcomm’s technology, they quickly add important new ‘table-stakes’ features… We continue to believe the RF opportunity for Qualcomm is generally underappreciated by the Street.” Rolland keeps a Positive rating (i.e. Buy) on QCOM, and raises the price target from $95 to $105. The implication for investors? Potential upside of 23% from current levels.

1068,"Reg. possible timelines for final decision :Not unexpectedly but understandably, Qualcomm just filed a 176-page opening brief with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in its appeal of the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust victory in the Northern District of California--and an 11-page unopposed motion explaining why the opening brief has to be that long.This has implications for the timeline. The most recent scheduling order, based on another unopposed Qualcomm motion, gave the FTC until October 25 for its responsive brief, and Qualcomm until November 15 for its reply brief. But in that motion Qualcomm already indicated that the FTC could also get an extension (after Qualcomm got two more weeks because the expedited schedule was too expedited even for them) should Qualcomm exceed page limits. It now turns out the FTC will even get twice as much extra time: four weeks. Qualcomm doesn't oppose it, so it's a given that the FTC will use that extra time and then file its responsive brief just before Thanksgiving--and then Qualcomm will have until mid-December for its reply brief.When the Ninth Circuit's motions panel for August granted Qualcomm's motion to stay the enforcement of two of the FTC's antitrust remedies yesterday morning and ordered that the hearing be scheduled for January, this extension was not factored in. As a result, the appellate hearing will presumably slip into February (February 3-7 or February 10-14), if not March 2-6; at the very earliest it might take place January 21-24 (the later one of the Ninth Circuit's two January 2020 court sessions), but the January 6-10 session doesn't appear to be a practical option anymore.

1143,"So much bluster, rhetoric, and craziness on both sides (companies and folks on this board). Here is my take on the facts as this moment in time.First and foremost. There is a CFIUS investigation. This is a serious, non-trivial matter. On the macro level, I see three possible outcomes. Based on their history, the most likely outcome is that CFIUS will require remedies to their concerns from AVGO, but will let the shareholder meeting proceed in four weeks. The second most likely outcome is that they will not be appeased by the remedies and will simply stop the transaction. The least likely outcome is that they will ask for another delay. I doubt this outcome because 1) it is such a high profile case, and 2) they are approaching jurisdictional deadlines.The second item is the QCOM acquisition of NXPI. As it currently stands (lack of significant tender, lack of regulatory approval), it is highly unlikely that QCOM will be able to acquire NXPI. The odds are almost nil if CFIUS allows the AVGO deal to continue, somewhat higher, but still unlikely absent AVGO.There is no other suitor waiting to swoop in and save QCOM from AVGO and from itself. If the AVGO transaction does not proceed (close to 50-50, but, due to potential remedies, probably a little in AVGO's favor), QCOM needs to come up with an entirely new plan.It is highly likely that all six AVGO nominated board members will be elected if the slate proceeds and a vote occurs.It is highly unlikely that AVGO will voluntarily either decrease or increase the current bid. It is possible, but not very likely, that the new BoD will enter negotiations for a higher price. If so, I would think a $1-$3 increase is about all that can be expected. So, the purchase price very likely be $82 with a very small chance of increasing, but probably not past $85.Assuming the AVGO deal is inked at $82, the QCOM price should rise to the $78-$80 range almost immediately; potentially a little higher initially as shorts cover.If neither the AVGO or NXPI deals are finalized, the QCOM pps should settle into a $58-$62 range for the next couple of years. It might initially drop a little further, but should rebound to that range fairly quickly.If the AVGO deal fails and the NXPI deal is inked (I view this scenario as probably the least likely of all), the QCOM price will probably settle into a $60-$64 range for at least a year. Even with the rosy QCOM earnings projections, thay don't see actual GAAP earnings from QCOM until at least FY20 (FY19 is 8 cents). AAPL will be in no hurry to come to a settlement agreement.",0.9947

1233,"For Friends can't access to WSJ :05/19/2019 | 12:15pm EDTBy Asa FitchNvidia Corp., the computer-graphics giant that made a successful bet on chips purpose-built for artificial intelligence, is facing new threats to its market dominance as rivals enter a multibillion-dollar race to power everything from customer-service chatbots to robotic lawn mowers.Qualcomm Inc., long the leading designer of silicon for smartphones, unveiled a new AI chip last month for use in cloud computing that it plans to sell next year. Graphcore, a U.K. chip-making startup that recently secured $200 million in new funding from investors including Microsoft Corp., is testing its chips and plans to release them commercially in the second half of this year.Underlining the commercial prospects for AI hardware, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. on Friday reached a deal to acquire Cray Inc., a company that makes high-end equipment for supercomputers that are increasingly being deployed for AI research.Demand for chips specialized for AI is growing at such a pace the industry can barely keep up. Sales of such chips are expected to double this year to around $8 billion and reach more than $34 billion by 2023, according to Gartner projections.That growth is creating opportunities for everyone. But with increasing competition, it will be harder for a single company to stay on top of the race for performance, said Linley Gwennap, the president of the Linley Group, a Silicon Valley research outfit.""When you have so many different companies, there's a new chip coming out every month, and if that one happens to grab the lead, how long are they going to stay there?"" he said. ""There is going to be a lot of this leapfrogging going on.""Nvidia owns about three-quarters of the market for AI chips, based on Gartner estimates. Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, said some of the most sophisticated AI algorithms recently had been developed using Nvidia hardware.He said Nvidia also is working to make its portfolio more flexible for customers by customizing its robust general-purpose chips with AI-specific circuitry -- and developing software to speed things up further. ""I think that's a really great advantage,"" he said.AI software enables computers to mimic human activity such as having conversations, making recommendations and avoiding obstacles on the street. Such systems require machines to perform a gargantuan number of simple calculations at the same time. That kind of math has traditionally been done by the central processing unit, or CPU -- the brain of a computer. Yet CPUs, which make their calculations one after another, aren't as good at the task as chips with lots of small brains making calculations at the same time.Nearly a decade ago, Nvidia recognized graphics processing units it sold for videogame enthusiasts and other niche buyers -- chips that calculate how to display animated pixels on a computer screen -- were well-suited to AI because they work largely in parallel.The Santa Clara, Calif., company plowed investment into adapting its chips for AI, positioning itself for a boom. Nvidia booked almost $3 billion in revenue last year from selling AI chips used in data centers. Its stock price has risen more than eightfold over the past five years.On Thursday, Nvidia reported quarterly earnings that fell 68% but beat analysts' expectations. A slowdown in data centers where the company's AI chips primarily reside was one factor that led to the decline. Cloud companies that made significant purchases last year are getting the most out of existing chips before buying new ones, Mr. Huang said.Chip companies aren't the only ones building AI silicon. Cloud-computing giants like Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc., huge buyers of Nvidia's chips, have started to design their own to meet their customers' specific needs. Their size -- Amazon's cloud unit had $25.66 billion in revenue last year -- give them ample resources to fund the high cost of development.""We can aggregate a bunch of customer demand on any workload type and justify investing in one of the specialized chips,"" said Peter DeSantis, vice president of global infrastructure at Amazon Web Services. In November, the Amazon cloud unit unveiled a custom processor called Inferentia optimized for a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The processors are to be deployed on AWS; Amazon doesn't plan to offer them to other companies.Intel Corp., already the biggest supplier of chips for computer servers, has gained a sizable foothold in AI chips for data centers by tweaking some of its most powerful CPUs to do better at AI tasks.Smaller companies, too, are building AI chips from the ground up. They include startups Mythic Inc., Graphcore and Habana Labs Ltd., which have drawn a surge of venture-capital interest after many years during which early-stage investors shunned chips.",0.9986

1333,"Few days left until ITC decision. In a first decision , Judge Pender (Administrative Law Judge for ITC) found a patent infringement but ruled out, that an import ban is against public interest. It was discussed, as an import ban was not often overruling an infringement. The nomination of Judge Pender is discussed to be in line with law or not (cannot link it but google calabresi pender itc, you will find details). Many things have happened, last Friday gave 3 court decisions (Rebate, Japan, San Diego). What could be decided on 26th ? A) The first decision is confirmed. Personally I don’t believe, because in San Diego another 3 patents have been found to be infringed by Apple. ITC would start to loose face, when they stretch the importance of public interest even more and devaluate patents at the same time. I give it a 30% likelihood. If it happens, share price should go below 50 days average. B) ITC speaks out a hard import ban. Apple would be forced to settle with Q. It is questionable, if an infringement of 1 or 4 patents (including the last three from San Diego) can justify a hard ban, although historically the argument of public interest was used only a few times. If it happens, share price will significantly go above 200days average, direction 70. I give it a 40% chance, the San Diego ruling makes it much more complicated for ITC. C) ITC speaks out temporarily import ban. ITC could contribute constructively by speaking out a time-limited import ban. It should be long enough, that Apple cannot play with workarounds but short enough to make Q think about a settlement as well. I give it a 70 % likelihood. The durance of the import ban is unclear for me (1 year ?) and the mechanism to bring Q also to the table cannot be ,ordered’ by ITC. However, I believe a temporary import ban will be the result. Depending on durance, share price will go direction 50 days average or 200 days average or above. I’m thankful for constructive advice and hope it’s helpful. Unnecessary to say, that leaks/rumors/fake news or true news could change the picture. Last but not least, I find it interesting that Apple did not appeal the San Diego court decision.",0.9826

She failed to be a judge. Judge by definition should be unbiased, be fair, objective and be loyal to government and its people she is serving. She failed to do all these. She never should have presided over this case, since in her mind Qualcomm was guilty of antitrust and she went out of her way to make sure she was right. She found Qualcomm violated Sherman antitrust act for not being fair, reasonable and non discriminatory and found Qualcomm to be monopoly. Judge Koh however had no problem with these traits found in her action during this trial. Koh’s decision in trial was just bad interpretations with antitrust overreach using Aspen case as her model. I wonder how far she dug to find this rather unique case and its relevance? Really ski resorts to cell phone chips! Her policy was complete opposite of what it was meant to do...protect consumers. Her policy is anticompetitive, anti innovative and anti American.She wrote 233 page lengthy documentation which was planned from beginning to make sure Qualcomm not only was found guilty but also make it difficult to win its appeal. Even Qualcomm’s evidence of Apple’s slide prevention that clearly showed Apple’s plan to “hurt Qualcomm financially” was ruled inadmissible in appeal process without any explanation. This Apple’s plan was the very reason that started as result of Apple’s instigation that lead to FTC’s attention therefore should have been allowed without prejudice. I believe that she has the right to be socialist belief and her way of life, however it should have stayed out of US court room. I had chance to follow her court room through twitter few months back, and I was really appalled at how she Behaved.

So they buy Intels modem division and now think they can develop a 5G modem on their own. The reality is that any Apple modem must be a multi mode / multi band 3G/4G/5G modem to operate on all networks and facilitate domestic and international roaming. It's incredibly difficult to do that and Apple will never get there with the data speeds and low latency of QCOM modems. Qualcomm is also already doing it on a 5 nanometer process. Or. If they do, the world be on to 6G by then. My take from that announcement was that Apple wants to renegotiate their supply contract with QCOM and this is the only leverage they can conjure up.",0.9216
1397,"So let me get this straight. People are selling in AH why?

Sales of radio frequency chips, a growth area for Qualcomm, increased 157% to $1.06 billion. Automotive chips sales were $212 million, up 44% from the previous year.""In what universe this isn't stellar?

1401,"Tendered their shares, are in bed with Hok Tan and Tim Cook. Qualcomm will eventually close this deal. The reason why this has been so difficult is that APPLE knows that once NXPI is part of Qualcomm it greatly minimizes their chance being acquired and the currenlty royalty model being eliminated. Once the NXPI deal is completed there will be an immediate pivot of Qualcomm and government staring down APPLE to pay them money owed in the billions, and complete a renogotiated % of phone cost Royalty agreement, similar to what was ratified with Samsung. At that juncture, Steve Mollekopt will continue to reduce costs within Qualcomm, own the 5 G evolution of wirless, and continue to drive new IoT NXPI techologies. Tim Cook needs to understand he will pay a % of phone Royalty for Qualcomm technology, if he doesnt negotiate in good faith and stop his planned out/ obstruction to Qualcomms business, Apple can then stop utilizing Qualcomm technology and go it alone in processor development and compete against technology developed by Qualcomm.

Michael Walkley on Monday reaffirmed his Buy rating for Qualcomm shares, saying Huawei accounts for a small portion of the company’s business.“Our current Qualcomm estimates include minimal contributions from Huawei,” he wrote. “Despite the near-term uncertainty from the Huawei ban to the wireless infrastructure and handset markets, we believe Qualcomm remains an attractive investment opportunity.The analyst is optimistic about Qualcomm’s ability to generate strong sales from its leadership in fifth-generation wireless technology.The shift to 5G is tremendously important to the semiconductor and telecom industries. Analysts expect 5G to deliver 10 to 40 times the current speed of 4G LTE networks. Its lower latency promises to enable new applications from self-driving vehicles to cloud gaming.Looking ahead. The analyst reaffirmed a price target of $105 for Qualcomm shares, representing a potential gain of 35% from the current price.“We believe Qualcomm is well positioned to benefit with increasing smartphone market share with leading Android OEMs as 5G smartphone shipments ramp entering 2020 and beyond,” he wrote.Get smart think long term and be rewarded!!",0.9964

Now I'm sure there are duplications from different outlets, but my rationale and hope is that there are a LOT of other cell phone manufacturers, (remember several months ago when Steve Mollenkopf stated they had from Equipment OEM's, 110 licensing agreements in hand at that time) so my suspicion is...we all know about the Samsung, Apple. Google etc. phones, but what about all the places and companies around the world that we are not factoring in because we may have never heard about them, well a search for that indicated around 180 manufacturers, granted they will not all be going to 5G, BUT MAYBE SOMEDAY!!!

Two hearings on two separate patents were heard just yesterday in Beijing, with more scheduled for next week and several others during the second week of January. It will be a busy holiday season for both sides’ counsel in China.So far, the PRB has issued decisions on 12 Qualcomm patents. Apple has notched just two total wins, and two partial ones.

By eliminating Intel, possibly Qualcom, and then who knows next, they have to try and cut costs. When you are trying to move the needle on a $2 Trillion monster you have to try and squeeze everything. This is a hedge for Apple. They have a 6 year plus 2 yr option on Qualcomm and will try their own development. If they fail then they will continue along this road but will pay dearly. This is why they settled last year. They are in a corner and Qualcomm holds all of the cards for years to come. Everyone thinks the Apple ecosystem will never be upended.

It allows drones to delivery packages (5G network from a mobile truck), allows robotics in factory due to low latency, autonomous cars can leap forward, etc. This will grow and evolve over the next several years. I posted earlier using NVIDIA as an example of how it gets beat down right before an incredible run (almost triple in six months from 200 last year). AMD is another one ... sitting at 16 to 19 then sudden drop to 9 only to be followed by a run to 30. AMD had a disruptive technology and large TAM... it was obvious but they had to go through that shake out.

Huawei has denied the report, saying there is no merit in it. Shanghai officials said they weren't aware of the situation. One of the sources says Huawei started exploring a possible sale as early as last September. It's apparently motivated by insufficient access to chip supplies amid U.S. sanctions. Since May 2019 Huawei has faced restrictions over allegations that it's a threat to national security. The sources say the potential divestment is a sign the firm doesn't expect relief from U.S. sanctions, even a with a new administration in Washington. Now any divestment could be a very big deal. Shipments of P and Mate phones were worth 39.7 billion dollars over the year to the third quarter of 2020.

With 5G handset shipments likely to more than triple from less than 200 million in 2020 to over 750 million in 2022, according to estimates compiled by Qualcomm, Qualcomm’s licensing, chipset and RFFE revenues are likely to experience a significant uplift as well.The Snapdragon platform’s versatility has also allowed Qualcomm to score some impressive design wins in extended reality (Augmented and Virtual Reality), voice and audio solutions, the IoT (including robotics platforms), mobile gaming and PCs. For reference, Qualcomm already counts over 11,000 IoT customers, with a SAM expected to reach $13 billion in 2022. In the PC/compute space, where the SAM is expected to reach $8 billion in 2022, Qualcomm’s partnerships with Microsoft and Lenovo to deliver always-connected 5G laptops with all-day battery life should be a strong growth opportunity.In the short term, the Ninth Circuit’s decision to overturn the lower-court ruling may not have had a big impact on Qualcomm. However, had the district court’s judgment been upheld, Qualcomm’s inability to fully monetize its more than 140,000 patents would have likely undermined its ability to keep properly funding the kind of R&D operation that allows it to pursue so many opportunities for licensing and hardware revenue.IHS Markit research from 2019 indicated that 5G will have $3.6 trillion in economic output by 2035 — and over $13.2 trillion when its contributions to adjacent industries are included. Qualcomm will benefit both directly and indirectly from the entire $13.2 trillion as its licensing and chipset business monetize 5G handsets and adjacencies.Now, without the handcuffs of uncertainty that have tethered the licensing disputes to the company’s entire innovation portfolio, Qualcomm is in a great position to deliver the returns investors have long been looking for.",0.9953

1666,"Tim Cook in his quest to screw QCOM and not pay for IPRs and breach the contract that Apple signed, tiedup with Intel transferring proprietary info, source code, etc to develop 5G tech, just as he had done with 4G. Apple instigated the FCC, foreign governments including Korea, Japan, China, Japan to fine, or reduce/withhold royalty payments. Using all kinds of fried chicken analogy. What Tim Cook and his engineers did not understand is that base band chips, in concert with other RF components, power control, etc are very complex to design, especially regarding 3G/4G and more important 5G. We are talking about complex wave transmission, interference, etc. A whole different game than designing power hogging microprocessors which is the core competency of Intel. No wonder the Intel 4G chipset is power hog and has low performance.Tim Cook bet the future of Apple on second stringer Intel for cutting edge 5 chips... in order to save $7.5-1.50=$6.00 or less than 1% of ASP of the iPhone. Talk about greed! Yes, Apple had to give up before the trial. Worse, is that Apple has been loosing market share in the smartphone market due to hi prices and lack of innovation. It is too late for the iPhone to have a 5G phone this year, while the competition will start selling them. Expect the iPhone market share to decline further. It is likely to affect their service revenue. Apple has not innovated much lately. Financial services are limited and late. They should have offered secure biometric based B2B, B2C, C2C, multi plaform, multi currency banking services, point of sale services, social networks, e-commerce, etc. Steve Mollenkopf stuck to his guns.,, kind like Churchill after the Blitzkrieg of France. QCOM has to deal with FCC plus the China/Huawei. FCC is unlikely to wipe out QCOM contracts and biz model at this stage. Huawei will cave in due to political pressure, especially if they want to export. QCOM is not an easy stock to hold. This time around I had only a small position prior to the trial which I increase within minutes of settlement. Nothing that will change my life at this stage of the game. Unlike in Sep-98 when I bought 6,250 shares at $38. Did not sell when the stock spike to $850 ($1,700+) in 15 months after QCOM won a legal case against Nokia (or Ericson?). Sold in 2005 for a fraction. This time around, I did not have the courage to make a big bet and I felt the upside was limited since QCOM is already an established company. Looking back, I should have bought a bucket of out of money call options expiring this month. A lot less risky that buying the stock. A loss in court for QCOM would have knocked the stock to $20 or less, especially with all the debt.I figure the upside is $100-120 in the intermediate term.

1808,"Second part...Carl Shapiro, a professor of economics at the University of California in Berkeley, took the stand Tuesday to analyze the impact of the no license, no chips policy and Qualcomm's royalty rates on handset makers, chip rivals and consumers. He concluded that Qualcomm had monopoly power over CDMA modem chips and over premium LTE modem chips through 2016.""It's my view they harmed competition in those two markets,"" he said. ...Qualcomm should be commended for its technological achievements,"" Shapiro added. ""But...what's really important is that companies who aren't quite as good or who don't have the scale are not impeded from trying to catch and threaten and challenge the leader.""He testified that Qualcomm is using its market power and its monopoly power over chips to extract an ""unusually high amount"" for royalties for patents. That raises the cost for rivals, weakens them as competitors and fortifies Qualcomm's monopoly power, Shapiro said. Losing access to Qualcomm's modems would impose costs on handset makers, including not being able to supply to consumers. ""That's a very heavy hammer that Qualcomm is bringing down, at least as a threat, in those negotiations,"" Shapiro said. Michael J. Lasinski, CEO of IP consulting firm 284 Partners, on Monday testified that Qualcomm's licensing fees are ""far too high to be consistent with their FRAND operations."" Standard essential patents must be licensed in a fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory manner. An Ericsson licensing executive, Christina Petersson, said in video testimony that a fair royalty rate for multimode LTE should be 6 percent to 8 percent per device. Lasinski said he determined it should be 6 percent because there's a lot more going into a phone than when Ericsson came up with its rate.Qualcomm's rates tend to be higher than that amount. Apple wanted to pay $1.50 per device in royalties to Qualcomm, based on a 5 percent fee for the cost of each $30 modem connecting iPhones to mobile networks. Instead, it ended up paying $7.50 per phone, an amount Qualcomm later wanted to raise, Apple's Williams testified. Qualcomm has argued that its broad patent portfolio and innovations justify its fees. CEO Mollenkopf, who took the stand Friday, defended the company's licensing practices, saying the way his company sells chips to smartphone makers is best for everybody involved.",0.9965

1813,"From Seeking AlphaQualcomm: Huge Growth Approaches Qualcomm has experienced years of bad luck and setbacks that appear to be coming to an end. After the coronavirus slowdown is complete, wireless 5G acceptance and product growth should propel results far into the future. Qualcomm can be purchased at cheaper than historical valuations, heading into well-above normal operating growth. High profit margins, a conservative balance sheet, a large share buyback leveraging upside, and a solid dividend story are worth consideration. Qualcomm (QCOM) has been busy since 2017, getting its future arranged for faster growth rates. Finally, after years of setbacks and obstacles, Wall Street is expecting a sharp jump in Qualcomm EPS into 2021-22. The owner/manufacturer of many of the patents and semiconductors that make wireless communication possible, Qualcomm is a critical player in the world’s information-technology economy. For long-term stockholders, patience may yet prove a virtue! It took several years of fifth-generation (5G) chip research & development for the newest wireless industry standard to become reality. The company spent hundreds of millions in legal fees fending off the Apple (AAPL) licensing and patent disputes between 2017-19. Plus, Qualcomm had to deal with its failed takeover attempt of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) during 2018. All told, today’s $89 price is not much different than its 2014 high quote around $80. Last but not least, the string of bad luck has been capped by the coronavirus economic shutdown and supply chain problems of 2020, estimated to dent June Q3 sales by 20-30%. After the NXP Semiconductors merger fell apart (an effort to expand and diversify away from its cell phone and smartphone chip and license focus), the company has done an admirable job of redeploying its cash hoard into a monster share buyback. The company has been able to repurchase 25% of its outstanding shares since the end of 2015, with a sizable chunk of it acquired last year. The good news is the balance sheet remains quite strong and liquid after the buyback, while leveraging future operating results for the remaining owners. Qualcomm has refocused its preparation for the new 5G wireless growth wave that began deployment in 2019. This back-to-basics approach should help the stock price to much stronger performance soon. Just last week, Qualcomm announced a new processor, the Snapdragon 690 CPU chip for cheaper sub-$500 smartphones (a consumer price-point representing 50% of global phone sales) geared toward 5G network access. Are you wondering what all the fuss over 5G is about? For perspective, experts believe the speed of 5G may encourage customers to use phone access as a replacement for cable TV subscriptions. If 5G does revolutionize wireless communication and internet access, Qualcomm’s piece of the pie could turn into an income bonanza! Settling all disputes with Apple was a huge win for the company, as sales/income trends from one of its largest customers will remain intact. Intel’s subsequent withdrawal from the immediate 5G chip market was also a positive, reducing competitive pressure, at least for a number of years. In the end, once the coronavirus economic mess becomes less intrusive to operations and demand sometime in 2021, the final weight holding Qualcomm in check will be removed. Wall Street analysts agree with this view. 2021-22 should usher in a dramatically stronger profit picture. And, the increase in earnings will be divided between fewer owners, after the large share buyback. Below you can see the unusual bump higher expected in EPS, especially against other available equities for your investment capital in the U.S. Estimates are calling for cash income to nearly double from $3.45 in fiscal 2020 to $6.23 per share by 2022-23. Analyst estimates collected by Yardeni Research are only looking for 2022 S&P 500 earnings to make it back to 2019's pre-recession level. On a relative basis, Qualcomm’s 75-90% surge above last year would be a standout winner.",0.9994

1895,"This puts the Huawei advance buying question to restTSMC Shrugs off Huawei Ban and Shows Who’s King By Tim Culpan | BloombergJuly 16, 2020 at 7:07 a.m. EDT Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. was expected to be severely hurt by a U.S. ban on producing chips designed by Huawei Technologies Co., one of its largest clients. The opposite seems true. The Taiwanese chip foundry posted earnings Thursday that far surpassed estimates, and went on to raise its revenue and spending guidance for this uniquely troubled year. Not only does Huawei make a large slice of the world’s telecommunications network equipment, it’s also a major international smartphone brand. To power a lot of that gear, it designs chips at its own HiSilicon unit that are manufactured by TSMC. But a May 15 edict from the U.S. Department of Commerce banning the use of American technology to make chips for Huawei has forced the Taiwanese company to stop taking orders from its Chinese client. Given that Huawei is the company’s second-largest customer behind Apple Inc., the move was widely expected to deliver a body blow to TSMC, especially in orders for its latest manufacturing technology. TSMC has barely flinched. The supply chain will adjust, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei told investors bluntly. In other words, the broader trends toward 5G mobile networks and smartphones, coupled with high-performance computing products (such as artificial intelligence and graphics) means that if end-customers don’t buy from Huawei, they’ll find someone else. And that alternative supplier is going to turn to TSMC for chips. So far, it looks like Nokia Oyj and Ericsson AB will replace Huawei in networks. In smartphones, brands from Xiaomi Corp. to Apple Inc. may benefit, while Huawei itself can ship devices using semiconductors from third-party designers like Qualcomm Inc. and MediaTek Inc. Asked how the Huawei ban would impact TSMC’s ability to fill up its multi-billion dollar factories, Chairman Mark Liu said that the company is progressing well in using any capacity left open. He’s putting his money where his mouth is. The company will now add another $1 billion for spending on new equipment in its 2020 plan, taking the budget as high as $17 billion. As if to prove the naysayers wrong, TSMC went one step further by raising its revenue forecast. In April, it expected sales would climb a “mid to high single digit percentage” this year. Now, the company reckons it will top 20% growth. It’s almost as if the Covid-19 pandemic and the Huawei ban had never happened. Companies are installing new servers, stay-at-home workers are buying computer monitors, and quarantined consumers are whiling away the hours on games consoles. What it comes down to is that in any scenario, electronics are being bought and semiconductors are running them. Inevitably, that means the world still needs TSMC.

1896,"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4258734 The guidance for non GAAP 3rd quarter is very very conservative: Page 4 Q is saying, revenue is to be 5.5 bn $ in 3rd quarter. Page 5 Q says, Revenue for QCL (licensing) to be 1.325 bn $, This leaves 4.175 bn $ revenue for QCT. EBT margin for 3rd quarter: 15% QCT, 70% QCL. Taking these numbers, I come to EBT of 626 m and 928 m totaling 1.554 bn $. With outstanding shares at 1.2 bn, this gives 1.3$ EPS for 3rd quarter. The 3rd quarter 2017, EPS have been 0.83$ ( I took 3rd Q 2017 being without the legal issues with Apple). Using the percentage of increase 3rd quarter 2019 (my assumption) to 3rd quarter 2017 actual and apply it to 4th quarter 2019, I calculate 1.44$ for 4th Quarter 2019.

1982,"Source : seeking alphaEach time someone buys a mobile phone, Qualcomm QCOM...makes a little bit of revenue. That’s because Qualcomm is the brains behind much of the knowhow that powers smartphones, including code division multiple access (CDMA) for third generation (3G) wireless networks, and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) for 4G. The wireless world is now on the cusp of another big network upgrade to 5G, and Qualcomm has a hand here, too. Qualcomm isn’t as domineering in this area, but 5G phones have to be backward-compatible, so they contain 3G- and 4G capability. The upshot: Qualcomm’s licensing business will continue to see solid growth for years to come as 5G ramps up. The company also designs chips used in smartphones, but licensing and royalty business represents about 75% of operating income.Importantly, COVID-19 doesn’t seem to be hurting the roll out of 5G. It’s a leading indicator for the health of Qualcomm, says the company’s CFO Akash Palkhiwala, so this is key for investors. Surprisingly, Qualcomm maintained its 2020 guidance for its 5G business in its late April earnings call. “We feel very comfortable with the full year guidance,” Palkhiwala told investors. In a hint of what may come soon to the rest of the world, about three-fourths of mobile phones launched in China so far this year were 5G. Qualcomm also benefits from two major long-term trends: The increasing wireless capabilities in cars especially as they add self-driving capabilities, and the Internet of Things.",0.995

They point to growth trends in data centers and video games. On Friday, Nvidia stock scored two price-target hikes. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann reiterated his buy rating on Nvidia stock and raised his price target to 500 from 400. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves kept his outperform rating on Nvidia stock and upped his price target to 461 from 385. In morning trading on the stock market today, Nvidia stock rose 0.7%, near 423.20. Earlier in the session, it notched an all-time high of 426.21. Several Strong Quarters PredictedNvidia's data center business should see growth for several quarters thanks to new graphics processing units, Mosesmann said. That's due to the secular shift to accelerated computing, and the company's Mellanox acquisition, he added. Nvidia's gaming chip business will benefit from expected growth in high-end desktop and notebook PCs later this year, he said. ""Strength in both of these segments should last for several quarters, in our opinion, helping to drive overall revenues for the company,"" Mosesmann said in a note to clients. ""We continue to like the Nvidia story over the long term."" Nvidia is a beneficiary of the Covid-19 pandemic. Its processors power cloud computing services and video game machines, Steves said. The pandemic has forced many people to work from home and has boosted at-home entertainment such as video games. ""We continue to believe that NVDA will work higher through year-end and wouldn't be surprised to see the stock eclipse $450/share in the next 5-6 months,"" he said. Nvidia Stock 'New Bellwether In Semiconductors'Steves called Nvidia ""the new bellwether in semiconductors"" after passing Intel (INTC) in market value earlier in the week. ""Not only is the company tied to a secular growing industry, we believe their software assets should allow the company to drive higher-than-normal operating margins in the foreseeable future,"" he said in his note. Nvidia stock ranks third on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks. Nvidia stock also is on IBD's Leaderboard stock watchlist. On April 7, Nvidia stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base at a buy point of 275.50, according to IBD MarketSmith charts.

Qualcomm Announces Next-Generation 5G RF Front End Solutions, Featuring Use of Artificial Intelligence for Sleeker, High Performance 10 Gigabit 5G DevicesWhat’s New: Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. today announced its next generation of Qualcomm RF Front End (RFFE) solutions for high-performance 5G mobile devices. The solutions are designed to support advanced performance and power-efficiency capabilities in the newly announced Qualcomm Snapdragon X65 and X62 5G Modem-RF Systems – bringing together modem, RF transceiver, RF front-end components with artificial intelligence (AI) assistance and mmWave antenna modules to enable OEMs to design premium 5G devices.And from another article...Qualcomm today announced its X65 modem, the 4G/5G component that will connect 2022's phones to carrier networks. The new modem allows for ""10 gigabit"" 5G connectivity, by expanding the number of 5G channels it can use at once. But there's a lot more going on here, which could further transform how we use 5G.Qualcomm's modems are used in nearly every high-end phone in the US, including those from Samsung and Apple. Apple inked a ""multiyear"" deal with Qualcomm in 2019, to cover at least the iPhone 12, 13, and 14 models, after which it may (or may not) start using modems it develops itself.The new modem will appear in phones in ""late 2021,"" according to Qualcomm. That means it has a chance of appearing in the iPhone 13. That would be a swerve for Apple, as it would mean skipping a generation of modems. The current iPhones have Qualcomm's X55, and this would mean they skip the X60. But Apple may also be the only Qualcomm smartphone customer that could pull this trick off, as only Apple buys discrete modems from Qualcomm. Other manufacturers wait for the modems to be integrated into Qualcomm's overall Snapdragon chipsets, which takes a few more months.",0.992

2252,"Did Qualcomm Just Reveal A Key Piece of the New iPhone?Louis NavellierLouis NavellierThe race to 5G wireless is on – and if your mobile carrier isn’t already pestering you to upgrade to a 5G phone, they will be soon.Your first opportunity is the Samsung Galaxy S20, due out in March. It’s sleeker than the latest iPhone: thinner and lighter, while offering a larger display – and connectivity to the ultrafast 5G networks. While the iPhone 11 launch in September was all about “slofies” (and a third camera), Apple (AAPL) is said to be working on a more innovative iPhone 12 for its 5G debut this fall.All of this is made possible by the hardware inside. In my experience, great hardware is one of the best ways to profit from any tech boom – and that includes 5G. Let’s take a look at that today, because Qualcomm (QCOM) just announced its latest contribution to the 5G revolution. And Apple is sure to take notice.The hot new product Qualcomm announced today, the Snapdragon X60, is a 5G modem. Now, when most people think of modems, they think of something like this – the equipment that gets you online at home or work:But the modems we’re talking about here are actually tiny chips that go inside smartphones (and other mobile devices):Above you see an example from Intel (INTC), which in August sold a modem division to Apple for a cool $1 billion. Like its Chinese competitor, Huawei Technologies, Apple was more inclined to develop its OWN chips.Custom hardware is a hallmark of Apple products. But, in the meantime, Qualcomm is still its chip supplier for the next few years – and the new X60 chips prove that it can make them as small and as efficient as Apple (and other smartphone makers) could hope for.Qualcomm has not announced the exact dimensions of this year’s Snapdragon X60 chips. But we do know that it’s made of transistors that are just 5 nanometers (that’s 5 billionths of a meter!) in size.From the expert who ""recommended Google before anyone else"":Is this 5G opportunity like getting in on Intel in the early days? (Surprise Verdict)Money manager Louis Navellier says anyone who makes an informed ""bet"" on this ""Smart Antenna"" technology right NOW... could fast-track their dream retirement over the next 24 to 36 months. Go here for details.And Qualcomm’s making another key upgrade from the current X55 chips: This will be the first “to support spectrum aggregation across all key 5G bands and combinations.” We talked last time about how 5G will use new millimeter-wave technology, and basically Qualcomm will deliver chips that let you access 5G speeds in any of the different networks.With 5G chips that are more versatile, efficient and smaller than its rivals, Qualcomm is clearly a step ahead in terms of the technology. How about as an investment?Well, I’m actually taking a different approach to 5G in my Growth Investor recommendations.To help you see why, here is how QCOM is looking right now in my Portfolio Grader:QCOM earns top marks of “A” for its Quantitative Grade, which is certainly a strong point in its favor. But overall, its sales and profitability scores make for a mediocre Fundamental Grade of “C.”Add it all up, and QCOM does manage to ring in as a B-rated “Buy.” But I’ve got a better way to invest in 5G now.Grab the Biggest Slice of the 5G ProfitsAs amazing as 5G promises to be, it doesn’t get us anywhere without the right infrastructure in place. You can never stream Netflix (NFLX) using your smartphone plan (at any speed!) unless there’s a cell tower nearby.With 5G, those cell towers will be able to provide cable modem speeds (approximately 100mps) to wireless devices. Within two years, most cell phones will be 5G enabled and be able to wirelessly handle television streaming. In fact, with the 5G infrastructure market set to grow at an annual rate of 67% over the next 10 years, the entire market will go from $780 million to nearly $48 billion. This buildout is where I see opportunity now.Cable companies can do their best to fight back with fiber optics…but their services aren’t even available in many rural areas. And anyway, they can’t compete with the convenience of a smartphone, once it’s got ultrafast 5G. That’s how my 5G infrastructure play will capture more market share from the broadband cable companies.The stock I’m targeting is enjoying an influx of big money on Wall Street, and it has strong fundamentals, too – making it an A-rated “Strong Buy” in",0.9995

2356,"By Karen Freifeld(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Commerce on Friday lifted a ban on U.S. companies selling goods to ZTE Corp, allowing China's second-largest telecommunications equipment maker to resume business.The Commerce Department had said it would remove the ban after ZTE paid a $1 billion penalty and placed $400 million in a U.S. bank escrow account as part of a settlement reached last month.""While we lifted the ban on ZTE, the department will remain vigilant as we closely monitor ZTE's actions to ensure compliance with all U.S. laws and regulations,"" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in an emailed statement.ZTE did not immediately respond to requests for comment.ZTE, which relies on U.S. components for its smart phones and networking gear, ceased major operations after the ban was ordered in April. The punishment came after the company made false statements about disciplining 35 employees involved with illegally shipping U.S.-origin goods to Iran and North Korea, Commerce officials said. ZTE pleaded guilty and settled with Commerce last year over the illegal shipments.On Thursday, ZTE's Hong Kong shares surged some 25 percent after Reuters broke news the United States had signed an escrow agreement that paved the way for ZTE to deposit the $400 million. The $1 billion penalty was sent to the U.S. Treasury last month.The $400 million will stay in an escrow account for as long as 10 years to provide the U.S. government access to the money if ZTE violates the latest settlement.The June settlement also required ZTE to change its board and management, and to allow the U.S. government unfettered site visits to verify U.S. components are being used as claimed.",0.99

He admitted to under-appreciating the Android limitations but fundamentally the thesis driving Qualcomm as his top pick for 2021 is fully intact Ramsey tells investors in a research note. Ramsey reiterated his Outperform rating and $180 price target on Qualcomm shares.Morgan Stanley trims Qualcomm target, stays Overweight after 'complicated' Q1 - Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore lowered the firm's price target on Qualcomm to $167 from $171 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares after what he calls ""a complicated quarter with many puts and takes."" Chipsets are ""much stronger than expected"" for March, but the company guided for a drawdown in June, while royalties were guided down for March and June, Moore tells investors.

I don’t see anybody who can bridge this gap,” this person said…[Steve] Mollenkopf, who was born in Baltimore, is a military buff who interned for the Central Intelligence Agency before joining Qualcomm. He has often made decisions after consulting individually with his top lieutenants, but many have left over the years, leaving him isolated and reliant on counsel from outside advisers.[Tim] Cook, an Alabama native, is an operations whiz who works to build consensus among Apple’s top-dozen leaders, often asking them, “What is the right thing to do?” The group-decision approach has resulted in a team of enforcers who defend Mr. Cook’s view that Qualcomm’s licensing practices—taking a 5% share of most of the sales price of an iPhone—was just plain wrong, allowing the chip maker to profit off Apple innovations in display and camera technology…A jury could determine who is the real victim: Qualcomm, which claims Apple is violating its patents by withholding royalties, or Apple, which argues Qualcomm has been overcharging for those patents for years.

But I am dismayed that the judge took this opportunity to create new legal obligations, undermine intellectual-property rights, and expand the application of our antitrust laws beyond U.S. borders.Qualcomm has announced that it will appeal the decision. Speaking for myself, and not for the FTC or any other commissioner, I encourage higher courts to reconsider the wisdom of the judgeʼs conclusions. In the interim, I write to make clear to businesses, fellow antitrust enforcers abroad, and law students my opinion that this ruling is both bad law and bad policy.”She concludes:“Thankfully, serious damage can yet be avoided. Qualcommʼs appeal will allow the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and potentially the Supreme Court, to assess the wisdom of these sweeping changes.

2616,"Netlist (NLST) is ""largely overlooked"" Who’s/What’s Netlist?Netlist holds several patents in server, storage, and hybrid memory, as well as rank multiplication and load reduction.What’s goin on here (the main course anyways)?Netlist has been in litigation with Googs since 2009 over allegations that Googs infringed upon Netlist’s seminal 912 hardware patent. Netlist alleges that Googs infringed the patent by building servers using the 912 patent technology. Netlist sued Googs on December 2009 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. The judge in the case ordered a random cross section of servers to be examined which showed that Googs indeed was using technology described in the 912 patent. Googs then asserted that the patent was invalid. In 2010 Googs requested an Inter Partes Reexamination of the 912 patent by the USPTO’s (United States Patent and Trademark Office) PTAB (Patent Trial and Appeal Board). While the reexamination was going on the Northern District Court granted a joint request made by both companies to stay the 912 patent infringement lawsuit until the USPTO made its findings. On January 2019 the PTAB upheld the validity of Netlist’s 912 patent. In April 2019 Googs appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In June 2020 the US Court of Appeals upheld the PTAB’s decision on the validity of the 912 patent. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic Googs was granted a 6 month extension to decide if it wanted to appeal this decision to the United States Supreme Court. Googs did not choose to appeal. On February 16, 2021 Netlist moved to lift the stay in the Northern District of California so the patent infringement lawsuit could continue. The Court granted the request and ordered that both Netlist and Googs shall appear for a telephone Case Management Conference on March 11, 2021.So, what’s the big deal?Netlist has a seminal patent. A seminal patent is defined as a patent that describes an invention so impactful that it creates or shifts the technology space. Netlist believes that the teachings of the 912 patent can be found in various DDR3 and DDR4 server DIMMs (Dual Inline Memory Module) as well as future products that will be produced under the DDR5 server DIMM standards currently being established by the industry. Furthermore, Netlist asserts that the 912 patent enabled Googs to build servers with high capacity and rapid memory that allowed servers to store an entire Oracle database in memory which allowed lightning fast search results. The 912 patent played a large part in Googs dominance in search engine capability. Right now, it is not a question whether Googs infringed the 912 patent. That has already been established. Now, Googs is at the stage where it can settle with Netlist or go to a jury trial to determine damages.What are the damages? Are they substantial?Damages will take into account both the product itself (internal factors) and the environment (external factors) in determining pricing. In this case Netlist will argue that the 912 patent established Googs dominance in regards to their search engine, which allowed monopolist profits that funded Goog’s entire ecosystem. While at the same time, Goog’s infringement of the patent prevented Netlist from establishing itself in the server memory marketplace. Netlist will most likely seek billions in damages. Also, the prospect of treble damages is in play as Netlist will allege willful infringement on Goog’s part. The most likely scenario is Googs will settle the case rather than risk going in front of a jury. A settlement would include a large lump sum plus licensing of the patent going forward.Anything else going on?Yeah you bet! Netlist also sued Inphi for infringement of the 912 patent in the US District Court for the Central District of California. That case was also stayed pending the Court of Appeals decision, and now that the 912 patent was upheld it is expected Netlist will resume court proceedings once it is finished with the Googs case.Also, on March 2020 Netlist filed a patent infringement lawsuit against SK Hynix in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas based on the infringement of Netlist’s 218, 523, and 595 patents in SK Hynix’s RDIMM and LRDIMM server memory products. SK Hynix petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“CAFC”) to change the venue from Texas to California. This petition was denied and the case will be tried in Texas. The Markman hearing was set for March 4, 2021 with Jury trial set for July 6, 2021. The Western District of Texas is notorious for being very pro-patent holder friendly.$AMD $MU $QCOM",0.9996

The consumers are getting all the benefits of these technologies. It even make Apple the biggest company in the world. Qualcomm has over 150 licensees, and they all paid the fee. Apple is the only company that do not have a direct licensing agreement with Qualcomm? Instead indirectly through its iPhone manufacturers.

At the same time, the Dow added 0.24%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.15%.Heading into today, shares of the chipmaker had lost 1.83% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 4.54% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.59% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from QCOM as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.09, up 111.11% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $8.28 billion, up 63.04% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $7.14 per share and revenue of $30.54 billion. These totals would mark changes of +70.41% and +29.79%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for QCOM. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 22.13, which means QCOM is trading at a discount to the group.It is also worth noting that QCOM currently has a PEG ratio of 1.06. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Wireless Equipment was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.42 at yesterday's closing price.The Wireless Equipment industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector.

Yet, not only are Qualcomm’s charges barely material to Apple, they are paid successfully by Apple’s smaller competitors (who often are charged much more as a percentage of revenue than Apple is as a function of volume). And, were what Apple is alleging true, then Qualcomm would be approaching a trillion dollar valuation–not Apple. Given this massive disparity in financial performance, revenue, profit, and valuation it looks like Apple is massively overcharging and not Qualcomm. The one huge difference is that Qualcomm is charging Apple, who once again isn’t paying their bills, and Apple is charging you.This kind of suggests that Apple believes that anyone under a contract that believes they are being overcharged should be able to simply not pay their bill. What if every Apple customer decided to follow Apple’s lead and not pay their bill until Apple lowered the cost of their phone and service back to where it used to be for the original iPhone?Now you’d be right to argue that if you didn’t pay what Apple wanted they wouldn’t sell you a phone, but Apple seems to argue that it would be unfair if Qualcomm did the same.",0.8272

Revenue of $4.8 billion was roughly in line with expectations of $4.76 billion. The chip maker’s predictions for the current quarter bracketed Wall Street’s expectations.Canaccord Genuity analyst T. Michael Walkley on Wednesday raised his price target for Qualcomm shares to $101 from $87 following the results. He has a Buy rating on the stock.“We believe Qualcomm has a strong chance to maintain its current licensing business and is well positioned to benefit with 5G network builds ramping around the world,” he wrote.Qualcomm stock was up 8.4% to $91.77 on Thursday.The analyst expects 5G smartphones will offer Qualcomm the opportunity to sell 50% more dollar chip content per device versus the prior 4G generation, due to the increasing complexity and higher pricing. Dollar chip content refers to the dollar value of chips that a device holds.In similar fashion, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee on Thursday increased his price forecast for the chip maker’s stock to $97 from $88.

In its final quarter of its 2020 fiscal year, Qualcomm’s RFFE business grew to $2.36 billion from $1.48 billion. This is thanks to the company developing technical competencies to support 5G, whereas competitors Broadcom AVGO, -0.62%, Skyworks SWKS, +1.40% and Qorvo QRVO, +1.62% have all struggled. The company seeks to capture 20% of this market by 2022 and is on pace to achieve the goal.Qualcomm will also benefit significantly from the rapid growth of 5G in 2021; it rolled out its new 4-series Snapdragon mobile platform this week, making feature-rich 5G devices possible in the low-end smartphone tiers. This should significantly add to incremental results for Qualcomm as it is still early days for 5G. All of this coupled with the announcement Tuesday of the appointment of long-time Qualcomm executive Cristiano Amon to succeed Steve Mollenkopf at the helm of the company sets up 2021 to be a promising year for Qualcomm.",0.9942

On fundamentals, there is no doubt QCOM is doing great. Their cash flow is solid and was solid even when Apple stopped paying. But the headwinds are really annoying. My single most argument for near term sell is as follows:Judge Koh is very likely to reject the stay appeal. Once this appeal is rejected and before 9th circuit puts a stay QCOM will have to re-negotiate their licensing terms. Worst part is they have to open up for external monitoring. While QCOM has solid case for bringing a stay on court order, even under expedited process 9th Circuit will take about an year to do so. Meanwhile the damage can be quite serious. Also FTC has no incentive to settle. They will push for full implementation of court order, which is a terrible judgement for QCOM. And QCOM will eventually win the FTC battle (even head of FTC says Koh's decision is ""bad application of law""), it will not be anytime soon. At least not for next 2 years. Till then the uncertainty hangs over QCOM. Others can share their thoughts. Pls note that I am not suggesting to short QCOM. Do not do that.

3201,"Here is the reason why I thing QCOM will eventually win the court battle over Apple. QCOM won the same argument in courts in Europe a few years back against Nokia and will win it again this time because once the issue is dissected Apple has no case:Without QCOM essential patents there would not be a wireless internet access (at a meaningful speed) that would thrive the smart phone business. In other words all the smart phone manufacturers will not be where they are today (specially Apple) if it wasn't because of QCOM's breakthrough inventions in 3G and 4G. So the court judge will ask this question from a potential apple customer to determine who should win the court case. The question is:How much would you pay for an iPhone if it didn't have any wireless capability except through WiFi? Meaning you could only access the internet at home. If the answer is people still would pay the full price, then judge will vote in favor of Apple. But if they say they wouldn't pay anything, then judge will vote in favor of Qualcomm and grant permission for QCOM to continue with the existing model. In my opinion no one would buy an iPhone without a 3G/4G capability. And it is only fair for QCOM to be rewarded for their inventions in 3G/4G so they can continue funding the 5G and future technologies.Notice that this model was not invented by QCOM. It is also used by Nokia and Erickson and was blessed by the communication industry to increase the competition and keep the price of the chips low. That is why you pay only $40 for a QCOM snapdragon but you pay $300 for an intel chip. That is the proof that the system worked. Apple probably pays more for the plastic material it uses in iPhone than the money it pays Qcom for their breakthrough inventions in 3G/4G and the modem chips they use.",0.9925

At their event, Qualcomm announced their first discrete dedicated AI processors, the Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 family.

In a nutshell, the company is developing a family of AI inference accelerators for the datacenter market. Though not quite a top-to-bottom initiative, these accelerators will come in a variety of form factors and TDPs to fit datacenter operator needs. And within this market Qualcomm expects to win by virtue of offering the most efficient inference accelerators on the market, offering performance well above current GPU and FPGA frontrunners.""""The actual architectural details on the Cloud AI 100 family are slim, however Qualcomm has given us just enough to work with.

3565,"Agreed. Almost 5% while you wait for them to work through one of biggest extortion attempts in the history of technology. This management has fought through the organized attempt by Apple and Broadcom to weaken and overtake this company. They failed. Half of the international antitrust uproar is fuel by the Apple machine. Apple has to find ways to keep growing. They are masters at pinching all of their suppliers. The supplier they cannot pinch is the one that owns all the core technology that allows their devices to have so much utility and value. Ultimately Apple wants to change the rules. Qualcomm is powerful enough to object. Apple doesnt like that, so they go about conspiring with the rest of the world to contend that what Qualcomm charges is unfair. Here is how this goes from here.... 1) NXPI deal is approved by China as part of a ZTE slap on the wrist workout 2) free Cash flow following that deal will be around 10 Billion a year. Now the street can ignore that fact, and that is ok, for Steve Mollenkopt will proceed to buy back every share he possibly can at these levels. 2) Dividend. Stable. Covered.

3580,"Low PE, High Payout Adds to QCOM Stock AppealTo be sure, even if such a deal takes some time, other factors make QCOM stock worth the wait. Despite the much-higher earnings projection for fiscal 2020, the forward PE comes in at just 15.7x. That multiple will bring an estimated earnings growth rate of 36.5% that year. Going further out, Wall Street projects average annual profit increases of 27.05% per year over the next five years.Furthermore, Qualcomm will make it worth it for investors to wait for the 5G revolution. Qualcomm’s current dividend stands at $2.48 a share, which takes the yield to just over 2.9%. While that pales in comparison to the 4.3% yield before the price spike, it still comes in well above S&P 500 index averages. QCOM has also increased this payout every year for the last eight years. If these payout hikes remained safe during the recent years of struggle for QCOM stock, they should continue once consumers begin buying 5G-compatible devices.Final Thoughts on QCOM StockFollowing its settlement with Apple, QCOM stock again trades in a range as the company faces its next battle. The magnitude of QCOM’s post-settlement move, coupled with a mixed earnings report, may weigh on the equity for now. Moreover, the company relies on China for the majority of its revenue. Such concerns could bring the same stagnation to Qualcomm stock that the shares faced during the Apple dispute.However, much like Apple, China may also have to agree to a trade settlement to move forward in 5G. Once the China situation becomes more settled and manufacturers begin to sell 5G-compatible phones in earnest, QCOM stock will have nowhere to go but up.Qualcomm Inc. shares were trading at $85.40 per share on Friday afternoon, up $1.62 (+1.93%). Year-to-date, QCOM has gained 51.81%, versus a 15.44% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.QCOM currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of B (Buy), and is ranked #15 of 90 stocks in the Semiconductor & Wireless Chip category.",0.9942

Huwei chipset is not politically and security risk acceptable. Samsung is a competitor and their commercial terms would be stiff. Regardless, Apple would need help in integrating the chip set into their phones. Plus Apple needs the non-essential patents from QCOM regarding power control and fast charging. Would stiff have continuing litigation and liabilities. So Apple had to cave in. It is going to cost $10B in back royalties plus interest, legal fees. I suspect royalties are not going to be cheap. QCOM can not afford to lower royalties because rest of licensees will demand similar terms. Huwei, Samsung will have to cave in. Forward Earnings are around $5/s and this deal could add $2 per CNBC estimate. I think it could be higher because of chipset set margins increasing. Plus revenues from other phone makers.

Then there were bad acquisitions that had to be written off (Netzero, display tech, etc). Not to mention litigation, etc. Simple math tells me this stock could make $8-10/s and PE could expand all the way to 18-20. However, nothing is simple about this company.

His estimate for annual licensing revenue is now $5.5 billion.The Ninth Circuit ruled that Qualcomm didn’t breach antitrust laws because the company isn’t required to license rival semiconductor suppliers.“The panel held that Qualcomm’s patent-licensing royalties and ‘no license, no chips’ policy did not impose an anticompetitive surcharge on rivals’ modem chip sales,” the Ninth Circuit panel wrote in the judicial opinion. “Instead, these aspects of Qualcomm’s business model were ‘chip-supplier neutral’ and did not undermine competition in the relevant markets.”",0.9765

3711,"A snippet from The Verge commenting on this CONVENIENT & TIMELY (for shorts and those that want in cheaper) release by Bloomberg.Qualcomm has more than physical radio chips going for it, of course; it also has a tremendous amount of intellectual property around cellular that it licenses to companies like Apple (and has been accused of using in anticompetitive ways, though it recently won an antitrust suit against the FTC). Ahead of Apple’s purchase of Intel’s modem business, it reached a surprise settlement with Qualcomm over patent infringement and struck a multiyear deal around the companies’ wireless IP — one where it wound up paying Qualcomm $4.5 billion, and where Apple wound up getting the Qualcomm chips it needed to build this year’s 5G iPhones.With its own cellular radios, Apple could at least be LESS reliant on Qualcomm. At best, it could build a better performing radio and offer better battery life, like it did with its new ARM chips vs. Intel.To be honest, the most “”SURPRISING”” thing about the Bloomberg report is that an Apple town hall meeting LEAKED at all, considering how SECRETIVE the company typically is. Bloomberg also reports that Apple CEO Tim Cook addressed when employees might return to the company’s physical offices during that meeting, saying it “seems likely” that most teams won’t return before June 2021.",0.9941

3775,"Trump's Stimulus Plan to Rev Up 5G AdoptionAniruddha GangulyZacksJune 17, 2020, 7:04 AM EDTThe year 2020 is touted as one which will witness network experience transformation through widespread implementation of 5G. The fifth-generation network, which boasts faster download speeds thereby facilitating seamless transfer of data, has gained immense significance amid the coronavirus outbreak that has pushed the economy online. Rapid proliferation of remote working, learning and health diagnosis amid lockdowns and shelter-in-place guidelines to curb the spread of the virus is exerting considerable stress on existing 4G networks. In order to address the rising traffic, online video content providers like Netflix had to compromise on streaming quality, much to the frustration of consumers. Moreover, growing demand for e-commerce, contactless delivery through drones and digital payment highlight the urgency for 5G network development. Hence, it’s not surprising that the Trump administration’s latest $1-trillion stimulus plan has reportedly earmarked a fund for developing 5G infrastructure. The draft proposal shows the latest effort by the U.S. government to revive the coronavirus-ravaged economy. Notably, all three major U.S. indices – the Dow Jones industrial, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq – rallied following reports on Trump’s infrastructure stimulus plan. 5G Prospects Aplenty 5G is expected to attract extensive infrastructure spending from major economies. Notably, China and South Korea are already spearheading in terms of spending, while United States is expected to catch up this year. As such, 5G infrastructure market is estimated to grow from $12.6 billion in 2020 to $44.9 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 28.97%, per a Research and Markets report. The solid growth in infrastructure spending bodes well for other 5G-related markets including chipset, equipment, network and edge computing. It is also expected to help in driving user base for 5G smartphone and apps. Additionally, 5G is likely to boost proliferation of smart connected homes, devices, hospitals, factories and cities along with self-driving vehicles. Moreover, it is expected to facilitate rapid adoption of emerging applications like AR, VR and AI. Further, 5G enables advanced technologies in the IoT space, for instance, extending sensor driven IoT capabilities to drones, actuators and robots.",0.996

QCOM has a monopoly on CDMA, and if they use it to hold back a company trying to build a cheaper way to utilize the spectrum for the benefit of the American consumers, then QCOM is guilty.

So far, we still don’t know, if patents have been infringed, about consequences of that like import ban and the role of public interest. So this leaves it to the April Court Case, where a jury has to decide. Almost forgotten: Judge Koh on the FTC case. So what she will do now? She preliminary ruled, that Q should go for component licensing. 2 month later, a Texas court ruled the opposite. Whilst FTC was saying, that Q’s prices are too high, in San Diego the jury ordered a price of 1.41$ fir just 3 patents. And during the FTC trial, Apple said, they have been forced into an exclusitivity contract, whilst Q said it was Apple who insisted on 1 bn rebate ( everybody who is in business for a year may know, who has the stronger hand in this negotiations).

3958,"The UK government looked set to begin the process of removing Huawei from networks in the country and ban operators from purchasing new equipment, after a review into the vendor found severe security issues, The Sunday Times reported. It reported a review by the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) deemed Huawei’s products unsecure, and ministers are likely to approve policy in the next two weeks which would see a ban on the purchase of new Huawei equipment implemented at the end of the year. Should the policy come into force, Huawei kit would be removed from existing parts of 5G networks by 2026 or 2027, which would be followed by its 4G and 3G involvement. UnprecedentedThe NCSC’s decision represents a major shift from earlier in the year, when the UK approved operators to use Huawei equipment in non-sensitive parts of their networks, limited to 35 per cent. However, in May, NCSC confirmed it was conducting a fresh review into the vendor to assess the impact of tightened US sanctions around the use of domestic components in overseas chip production. The Sunday Times reported the NCSC found the US move “fundamentally changes” the situation, prompting the policy changes, which could be announced officially at the end of this month. An unnamed government source told The Sunday Times the US sanctions are “unlike anything we’ve ever seen before”. “Huawei is in a position without any easy fixes or loopholes. This fundamentally changes the calculation. The impacts are so severe that, given the need to give clarity to industry, there will be decision taken and parliament will be notified this month,” the source said. The shift in stance on Huawei would represent a major victory for both the US, which lobbied for its allies to ban the vendor, and certain MPs within the government, who maintained pressure on UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to take a harder line on the company. Huawei has protested its innocence since news of NCSC’s review in May, arguing it posed no security risk and insisting it operates independently from the Chinese government.",0.9302

If it can accomplish this, the number of devices with self contained capability will skyrocket, relieving the strain on edge computing and allowing it to do more important processing functions. This is a win for Qualcomm, and potentially a win for all forms of new, visually “smart” products. While Qualcomm is not the only silicon vendor in this race, its R&D efforts should put it ahead of many, and it should benefit significantly from its leadership. ",0.9897

The fact that he didn't makes me think that he must stand his ground and defend Broadcom. His business model is that of acquiring other entities, running them more efficiently and making them more profitable. The Treasury letter essentially says Broadcom isn't trusted by the U.S. Government, is not innovative, isn't a telecom leader, etc. How far can Broadcom get in the marketplace unless he can succeed in getting the U.S. Government to eventually approve of the Broadcom business model?The posts on this board and the Treasury letter that proclaim that QCOM is a crown jewel, etc. is all well and good but means nothing if it cannot be translated into a superior return for the owners of QCOM.

4106,"What Qualcomm really needs to do to accelerate its growth rate and strengthen its technology leadership in the entire tech sector is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for Qualcomm (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Qualcomm just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

Because I'm sure you're not going to talk about when you're going to do 5G, but clearly it helps that path. Thank you.Tim CookYeah. Thank you, Shannon. We're glad to put the litigation behind us, and all the litigation around the world has been dismissed and settled. We're very happy to have a multi-year supply agreement. And we're happy that we have a direct license arrangement with Qualcomm, which was I know important for both companies, and so we feel good about the resolution.Wamsi MohanThanks for the color Tim. And as my follow-up Luca can you just clarify if the settlement with Qualcomm is creating either a headwind or a tailwind to your gross margins in the near-term? And does your guidance contemplate incremental pricing actions that could be creating some gross margin headwinds? Thank you.Luca MaestriAs Tim has explained we've reach this comprehensive agreement with Qualcomm. As part of this we have agreed that we're not going to share the financial terms of the agreement, so we plan to honor that.

Given that AVGO's CEO and Board are overwhelmingly American citizens and its shares are traded on NASDAQ and its owners are primarily U.S. based institutional funds, I think there is a strong argument that CFIUS doesn't even have authority now.

Last night, another global power revealed that it is 5G-ready, as state-owned carrier China Unicom announced that it’s moving up China’s first 5G network deployment to May. The news was unsurprisingly trumpeted by key 5G chipmaker Qualcomm, which has taken a key role in supplying components and support for all of the launches, and will have 5G modems inside most of China Unicom’s first 5G devices.""""To mark this significant global milestone for 5G deployments, I interviewed Qualcomm 5G marketing director Ignacio Contreras and 5G communications lead Samir Khazaka, discussing both the China Unicom announcement and the broader state of 5G across the world today. The message was clear: “all rational players in the industry” are in the process of preparing to deploy 5G very quickly, as there’s widespread carrier and consumer interest in faster, more capable devices and networks — noticeably more excitement than in the 3G to 4G transition.""https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/qualcomm-interview-chinas-early-launch-proves-the-world-wants-5g-now/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+venturebeat%2FSZYF+%28VentureBeat%29",0.9872

4365,"Qualcomm Demands German Court Fine Apple for Continuing to Sell iPhones After BanThursday January 31, 2019 10:31 am PST by Juli CloverQualcomm today filed a motion calling for a German court to levy fines against Apple for not complying with a December import ban barring iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models from being sold in Germany, reports Bloomberg. According to Qualcomm, Apple failed to properly recall the banned iPhones from third-party sellers and continued to sell them in some Apple Stores in early January. Qualcomm in early January posted 1.34 billion euros in security bonds to enforce the ban, and Apple pulled its iPhones entirely from the country the next day. Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said that Apple ""intentionally"" defied the court order and continued to sell iPhones in some stores, and that the company ""obviously"" doesn't consider itself ""bound by the injunction."" ""Significant fines must be imposed to put a check on that,"" he wrote in a statement to Bloomberg. To prove Apple's non-compliance with the order, Qualcomm pointed towards a December press release that Apple has already been forced to retract. In the press release, Apple said that while the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models would be unavailable for purchase at its own retail stores, the devices would be available from carriers and third-party retailers. Qualcomm and Apple have been embroiled in an increasingly tense legal battle since January 2017. Qualcomm has thus far won sales bans on older devices in China and Germany, rulings that Apple is fighting against. Over the course of the last month, representatives from both companies were in a Northern California court for the Qualcomm v. FTC antitrust lawsuit. The FTC has accused Qualcomm of using anticompetitive tactics to remain the main supplier for baseband processors for smartphones, an argument similar to Apple's. The Qualcomm/FTC trial wrapped up yesterday, and we are awaiting a verdict from the presiding judge, Lucy Koh, who also handled Apple v. Samsung.Tag: Qualcomm",0.9795

Luca MaestriSo on the December performance, as you know, Toni, this was a very different cycle because we launched at a different time than usual. And so, we had an initial part of the quarter where, obviously, we didn't have the new phones. And then as we launched the new phones, we also did the channel fill that typically happens, to a certain extent, in the September quarter.At the end of the quarter, the demand has been very strong. And so we've been constrained, as I said, on -- especially in the Pro models. At the end of December, we exited with a level of iPhone channel inventory, which was slightly below a year ago. So we -- and we still had some level of supply constraints, which we believe we're going to be able to solve during the March quarter.In terms of the sequential change, we talked about -- during the prepared remarks, we talked about total company average, and we said that we expect that sequential progression to be similar to the typical seasonality that you've seen in past years. Certainly, last year is not typical because of COVID. But if you go back, fiscal '17, '18, '19, that's our typical seasonal progression.And we mentioned a couple of product categories, Services and Wearables, where we're going to be having a slightly more difficult compare.

That being said, Qualcomm’s management noted Huawei is not a significant customer. In fact, Walkley argues the move could be good for the chipmaker. “We view any Huawei smartphone share losses, which are likely with it not gaining access to Android software, as a benefit to Qualcomm as its leading QCT customers such as OPPO and Vivo are likely to gain market share from Huawei,” said the 5-star analyst.",0.889

THEY WANT YOUR SHARES>>>Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives notes that Apple's stock has taken a breather since its ""jaw dropping"" performance in the December quarter came and passed for the Street in late January. That said, the analyst views this as a short-term blip in the stock's upward trajectory as his Asia supply chain checks continue to show robust strength in this iPhone 12 supercycle into the rest of 2021. Given the fundamental strength he is seeing for this supercycle, coupled by a further re-rating on the horizon, Ives believes Apple will hit $3T in market cap by year-end. Importantly, with his estimation that 350M of 950M iPhones worldwide are currently in the window of an upgrade opportunity, the analyst thinks this will translate into an unprecedented upgrade cycle for the company. He also believes there is an upward shift of ASPs for iPhones in this cycle as the iPhone Pro continues to be the predominant model sold globally, which bodes well for top-line numbers heading into the March and June quarters. He has an Outperform rating and a price target of $175 on the shares.",0.986

4540,"1. The ban is a preliminary injunction (or ""PI"") issued by a Chinese court that bans iPhone models 6s to X because, in the court's opinion, these devices infringe on 2 Qualcomm patents. 2. These patents are pretty fundamental features. They involve photo editing and interfacing with apps on your phone, using a touchscreen. They are not cosmetic or ""minor,"" as some outlets have suggested. 3. The trial is already over. The PI is in place to block Apple from importing and selling these phones while the court prepares its final verdict. The evidence against Apple must be pretty compelling for the court to issue this PI. 4. Because it is a preliminary injunction, not a final verdict, it cannot be appealed. Anyone who tells you that this PI/ban is being appealed ""through the courts"" is making an inaccurate statement. 5. The PI (ban) makes no mention of iOS11 or iOS12. Stories mentioning that the PI is limited to iOS11 phones are incorrect. Per the PI, iOS11 and iOS12 are immaterial. The ban focuses on specific iPhone models, irreverent of specific iOS versions. 6. The claim that iOS12 provides a fix doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Evidence has already surfaced that iPhones shipping with iOS12.0.1 (in China) still have the features at the heart of the ban. 7. IF a future version of iOS12 does indeed provide a way around the patent infringement issues that triggered the PI, (if), Apple will still have to prove it to the court *before* the updated phones can be deemed exempt from the PI. 8. The PI (iPhone ban) is in currently effect. A separate (but similar) complaint has been filed by Qualcomm against Apple this week, asserting that the same instances of patent infringement are evident in the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR. 9. There is more to this ban, but those are the highlights. Apple evidently got caught using Qualcomm's IP without permission, and a Chinese court has issued a PI to block the sale of some iphones. That's it. More cases of this type are ongoing in China, Germany, and in the US.",0.9453

Nightmare before Christmas to QCOM employeesQualcomm announced that its Board of Directors approved a $16 billion accelerated stock repurchase agreement as part of a $30 billion stock repurchase program announced in July. “We remain on track to complete a large majority of the announced program by the end of fiscal 2019,” said CEO Steve Mollenkopf. “The Board and the management team remain committed to returning capital to stockholders while we also continue to invest to create longer term stockholder value.” The repurchase will be funded by existing cash resources.Furthermore, Qualcomm has been embroiled in antitrust lawsuits in the past couple of years and has had to pay billion-dollar fines, and its NXP acquisition was cancelled, which forced the company to cut another $1 billion dollar in costs and lay off 1,200 employees.Qualcomm continues to shed workers in San Diego and elsewhere as part of a pledge to shave $1 billion in annual costs: 269 jobs in California and North Carolina. It disclosed the layoffs in Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notices filed with the employment agencies in both states. At its San Diego headquarters, Qualcomm is letting go 125 workers. In North Carolina, 144 workers are losing their jobs. Layoffs take effect in early February.Qualcomm has all but eliminated its server chip division, cutting its workforce from about 1,000 employees earlier this year to only 50. The division was in charge of building the 48-core Centriq 2400 processor, which Qualcomm launched in 2017 on the 10nm process.Chinese Joint Venture Will Build Qualcomm’s Centriq Chip. Qualcomm’s Centriq IP will continue to live under the Thang Long 4800 brand name used by HXT, a joint venture set up between the Chinese Guizhou Province and Qualcomm, with 55 percent of the joint venture owned by the Guizhou Province.The Thang Long 4800 seems to be almost identical to the Centriq 2400, with one exception. The chip uses a different encryption module that aims to comply with China’s encryption regulations, June 19, 2018, Qualcomm is laying off 1,231 San Diego employees and another 269 workers in Northern California as part of a $1 billion cost- cutting plan.Qualcomm's cost-cutting plan was part of an effort to prevent a hostile takeover by rival Broadcom.

Yet the opinion has no trouble relying on and describes at length the obviously conflicted testimony of producer/licensees, such as Samsung, Huawei and others, who unsurprisingly allege that Qualcomm’s royalties are “too high.” The district court’s failure to engage with the economic testimony in this case compares unfavorably with the district court’s thorough examination of the economic testimony in US v.

Plans for a folding iPhone and Face ID-inspired display miraculously surfaced this week buy some goodwill. But a much bigger obstacle suddenly lies.The ever-excellent MacRumors has attained a new research note from financial giant Barclays which reveals iPhones will not only miss out on 5G in 2019, but all 2020 models may be restricted to 4G as well.Barclays explains that the modem design for 2020 iPhones ""needs to be set now,"" and Intel’s race to ship its first 5G smartphone modem in late 2019 ""does not work with Apple's timeline.""Compounding this is Apple’s legal fight with Qualcomm. The chip giant is the obvious alternative and its 5G modems are commercially ready. Unfortunately, the two companies are engaged in a ferocious legal battle and Barclays states that time “seems to be running out"" for Apple to patch up differences with Qualcomm to plug its Intel-shaped gap.It also seems Apple has exhausted all alternative avenues.Apple testified that it approached Samsung and MediaTek as potential suppliers, but doubts have emerged that they can “meet Apple's production, performance, and cost demands.” Apple has even started working on its own modems, but they are years away from commercial release.The good news is Apple should get away with it this year. While 5G phones and 5G networks will both launch this year, availability will be limited. But this changes in 2020 and releasing premium iPhones without 5G for the October 2020 to October 2021 lifecycle is marketing suicide.When Apple and Qualcomm kicked off their legal battle in 2017, it was widely assumed Apple had the upper hand.

In a nutshell: FTC dropped Judge Koh‘s Argumentation around the Aspen Ski Ressort, saying that the high standards of the Aspen Ski Ressort court findings are not applicable. Focus of FTC is now the partial summary of Judge Koh: Q is committed to license on component level due to ATIS and TTA rules (whilst Q is a member of ATIS and TTA). FTC does not refer to Texas Court Ruling, which denies the duty to license on component level. Argument of FTC: Q has contractual obligation to license on component = chip level (not on device level) due to the obligation based on ATIS and TTA rules. Apart from the diametral findings of the Texas Court, it’s worth to understand, that both ATIS and TTA don’t make it clear, which SEP have to license on what level: SEPs which are fully carried out within a modem chipset OR SEPs which are partially carried out within a modem chipset OR all SEPs regardless of where implemented. As there are no standards for chipset modems, how would be deciding process what sections of what standards are practiced by Modem chipsets ? ETSI does not require component licensing: so companies, who are only ETSI member could license on device level, ATIS and TTA members on component level.

Oppo Reno 5 series detailed, expected to feature unannounced Snapdragon 860 What’s interesting is that at least one of the handsets in the series could feature Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 775G or Snapdragon 860 SoCs – both of which have not been revealed by Qualcomm yet.AuthorHT TECH 22 Aug 2020, 04:53 PM IST in MOBILEOppo Reno 4 (HT Tech) Oppo has already launched the Reno4 flagship but it looks like the Chinese tech firm is already working on Reno 5 smartphones. This is hinted by a tipster on Weibo. The post suggests that the Reno 5 series may include the Oppo Reno 5, Oppo Reno 5 Pro, and the Oppo Reno 5 Pro+ models. Some information on the processor of the handsets have also been revealed. What’s interesting is that at least one of the handsets in the series could feature Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 775G or Snapdragon 860 SoCs – both of which have not been revealed by Qualcomm yet. sually Qualcomm reveals the processor, days or weeks before the arrival of first handset that features the chipset. We saw this happening quite recently when Qualcomm revealed its Snapdragon 865+ processor, days before Asus and Lenovo revealed their ROG Phone 3 and Legion gaming smartphones featuring it. Corning did the same with Gorilla Glass Victus before the Galaxy Note 20 announcement.Also read: Oppo F17 Pro with an ultra-slim design set to launch in India soonHowever, from the moniker it is safe to assume that Snapdragon 775G will be the successor of Snapdragon 765G while the Snapdragon 860 could be the slightly less powerful version of the current Snapdragon 865 SoC.What, however, adds weight to this claim is a report from earlier this month when a user on Weibo said that Qualcomm Snapdragon 860 was mentioned in a meeting that involved Oppo executives as well.But as per a theory, Qualcomm might not launch the Snapdragon 860 at all or is late to do so. if Qualcomm sticks with its launch plan like every year, it will introduce the rumoured Snapdragon 875 by end of this year. This doesn’t leave it with enough time frame to launch the Snapdragon 860. In addition, the model number suggests it to be the lighter version of Snapdragon 865 but Qualcomm is already giving Snapdragon 765G, which it launched alongside the 865 late last year.",0.9977

In focus of the investigation of the Review will be: how long would it take Apple to design around the infringed patent ? What National Security concerns would be implicated by a sales ban and whether a limited import ban could be adopted. The ITC wants to also understand better Intel’s Position reg. 5G, in case an import ban is spoken out. The investigation of the ITC should have been finished Jan 29. Government Shutdown may have an influence on the durance of the investigation, as final decision of the ITC tribunal was postponed to late March. After all, the most important question from a practical perspective could be, if a workaround of the above mentioned patent is possible easily or not.

5034,"Qualcomm Snapdragon 875, Next-Gen Modem Based on 5nm Node Reportedly Go Into Production at TSMC FacilityBy Omar Sohail / 30 mins agoAccording to new reports, TSMC has officially entered the production stage for 5nm chips. Depending on what its clientele desires, there are reports of three 5nm nodes; the regular 5nm, 5nm+, and then you have the enhanced 5nm manufacturing process. There’s no confirmation which process Qualcomm has opted for, but if reports are true, the Snapdragon 875 should be available soon along with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X60 5G modem, which is the first baseband chip to be made on the 5nm architecture.The Timeline Also Suggests TSMC Would Have Commenced Production of Apple’s 5nm A14 Bionic ChipsThe production phase at the Nanke 18 factory has been increased by 10 percent to nearly 60,000 units in a single month, according to the text published at MyDrivers. Qualcomm is reportedly investing between 6,000-10,000 5nm wafers per month, most likely because it wants to deliver both the Snapdragon 875 and Snapdragon X60 on time. According to a previous report, all iPhone 12 models would feature a Snapdragon X60 5G baseband chip instead of the Snapdragon X55 one rumored some time back.Also, a previous Snapdragon 875 specs leak pointed towards an integrated 5G modem, which is the complete opposite business practice that Qualcomm employed with its Snapdragon 865. Looking at all these previous reports provides weight to the rumors that the new iPhone models will be rocking the newest Snapdragon X60 5G modem, but we’ll still advise our readers to treat this information with a pinch of salt.According to estimates, the Snapdragon 875 could be delivered to Qualcomm around September, with the chipset manufacturer’s executives expected to make an appearance in December 2020 at the Snapdragon Summit to showcase what the new silicon can achieve. It’s very unlikely that any smartphone this year will tout a Snapdragon 875, not while there’s a huge change that the Snapdragon 865 Plus launch is right around the corner, thanks to a wave of leaks.The Snapdragon 865 Plus is tipped to have higher CPU and GPU clock speeds than the regular Snapdragon 865, which only means that the Snapdragon 875 unveiling will take place in December later this year.

The proposed all-cash transaction is valued at about $1.4 billion. Nuvia’s expertise in designing central processing units, Qualcomm said, would help it boost chip performance and power efficiency—characteristics that are vital to success in the hot 5G-networking market that Qualcomm has made a priority. The San Diego-based chip company is also bolstering its talent pool with the planned acquisition, adding Nuvia’s staff and three founders, Gerard Williams III, Manu Gulati and John Bruno. Mr. Williams was lead chip architect at Apple before decamping to start Nuvia two years ago. Mr. Gulati and Mr. Bruno both worked at Apple and Google. The Nuvia team are proven innovators,” said Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm’s president who this month was named to replace Steve Mollenkopf as chief executive at midyear.A wave of deal making across the U.S. semiconductor landscape is transforming the industry amid strong demand for laptops, videogames and data centers.

5203,"QCOM IN INDIA...Qualcomm has become the newest high-profile backer of four-year-old Reliance Jio Platforms, which has raised more than $15.7 billion in the past 12 weeks from as many investors. On Sunday evening, Qualcomm Ventures said it will invest $97 million in Reliance Jio Platforms to acquire a 0.15% equity stake ""on a fully diluted basis"" in the top Indian telecom operator. Qualcomm said it will help Jio Platforms ""roll out advanced 5G infrastructure and services for Indian customers."" Reliance Jio Platforms, which competes with Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea in India, has disrupted the Indian telecommunications market by offering cut-rate voice and data plans. It has amassed nearly 400 million subscribers to become the top carrier in the world's second largest internet market in less than four years of its existence. Its dominance in the Indian telecom operator while maintaining an ARPU (average revenue per user) that match those of its rivals has made Reliance Jio Platforms -- a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, India's most valued firm -- an attractive firm for a roster of high-profile investors. Facebook, Silver Lake, General Atlantic, Intel are some of the firms that have backed Jio Platforms at the height of a global pandemic. Jio Platforms has sold 25.24% stake in the firm during the period. The digital unit for Reliance Industries also operates a number of digital services including streaming services for music, live TV channels, and movies and TV shows. Earlier this month, the Indian firm added a new service to its arsenal: A video conferencing service. Steve Mollenkopf, chief executive of Qualcomm, said the firm believes that Reliance Jio Platforms ""will deliver a new set of services and experiences to Indian consumers"" in the future. ""With unmatched speeds and emerging use cases, 5G is expected to transform every industry in the coming years. Jio Platforms has led the digital revolution in India through its extensive digital and technological capabilities. As an enabler and investor with a longstanding presence in India, we look forward to playing a role in Jio's vision to further revolutionize India’s digital economy,” he said in a statement. India’s richest man built a telecom operator everyone wants a piece of Some investors have told TechCrunch in recent months that Reliance Jio Platforms' owner -- India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani -- and his closeness to the ruling political party in India are also crucial to why the digital unit of Reliance Industries is so attractive to many. They believe that buying a stake in Jio Platforms would lower the regulatory burden they currently face in India. The investors requested anonymity as they did not wish to talk about the political tie ups publicly. A person familiar with the matter at one of the 12 firms that has backed Reliance Jio Platforms said that the Indian firm is also enticing as globally companies are trying to cut down their reliance and exposure on China. India, and the U.S., in recent months have taken actions to limit their reliance on Chinese firms. New Delhi last month banned 59 apps and services including TikTok that are developed by Chinese firms. Reliance Jio Platforms has interestingly yet to raise capital from any Chinese investor. ""Qualcomm has been a valued partner for several years and we have a shared vision of connecting everything by building a robust and secure wireless and digital network and extending the benefits of digital connectivity to everyone in India,"" said Ambani in a statement Sunday.",0.9984

5240,"Reg. Import Ban in Germany: As known, Munich Court found that Apple infringed patent of Q and the court ordered an import ban and to stop selling certain IPhones. Based on German law, the producer (Apple) has to undertake serious activities to make sure that products are being withdrawn. However, in press releases Apple did rather the opposite by informing that these IPhones remain available in the trade, but not in Apple Stores. Q filed a complaint, the court came back with an injunction that Apple has to withdraw the press release and is not allowed to repeat. In a further complaint, Q is arguing that Apple does not undertake serious steps to withdraw IPhones and wants Apple to be fined. Normally fines could be between 5 and 250.000 € per violation (in rare cases imprisonments of CEO could be ordered). Q had to deposit almost 1.4 billion €, in case the injunction of sales stop would be overruled from an appellate court; Apple appealed the sales stop, whilst the injunction had immediate effect. Apples behaviour (press release) could lead to a situation, that the court feels mocked; the fine also in context with Q deposit of 1.4 billion (not million) € could be hefty. Other patent infringement cases are partly decided, either Apple or Q are to appeal the court decisions. Partly the European Patent Office is involved, which will move final decisions to May. Only if the German Courts reacts very harsh on Apples a.m. behaviour, a General settlement seems to be possible. Personally I think ,only‘ a fine will be ordered by the Court. Today there was a press release on finance.yahoo that Apple works on a workaround reg. the infringed patent. As the infringed patent is a hardware component, there is quite some skepticism around this workaround. The German court for sure will want to understand precisely what Apple intends to do (whilst imposing the fine). Again, the situation in Germany may only trigger a settlement, in case the court feels mocked or even more. This will bring more attention to the ITC case, where decision was postponed to late March. The ITC tribunal will decide on an import ban in the US due to another patent infringement.",0.9859

And some handset vendors are likely to adjust their AP inventories in the latter half of the year.Digitimes Research estimates that APs for 4G smartphones will remain the mainstream of shipments to China in 2021, accounting for over 50% of total shipments.In the second half of 2021, the ratio of APs built using 4/5nm nodes will reach 7% of all AP shipments, and 5nm products will be the majority in the 4/5nm segment.China will continue to be the largest outlet for 5G APs in 2021, taking up 56% of the global total, with Qualcomm, MediaTek and Samsung Electronics being the top-3 vendors.Both Qualcomm and MediaTek will see their market share increase significantly in the year, with the former enjoying a higher growth rate.",0.9959

Broadcom will need to raise the bid to thwart the NXPI buyout and successfully acquire Qualcomm. Qualcomm is in a tricky spot. Shareholders will demand at least $80 a share from Broadcom. But NXPI shareholders want more, too. If NXPI senses it can get more, it could break from the deal, leaving Qualcomm more vulnerable to Broadcom. QCOM and NXPI shares are ultimately undervalued even with the pending buyouts. But under Broadcom, the consolidation would likely protect the royalty rates and give the bigger company more negotiation power over Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). For now, Apple’s complaint over Qualcomm’s royalty rates could cut costs for the iPhone supplier if the courts rule in its favor. NXP would owe $2 billion to Qualcomm if it tries to break from the deal before April 2018. A failure to get regulatory approval would leave NXP with no fees owed. More likely is that Apple’s case against Qualcomm will not hold up in court. Apple is ultimately looking for better royalty rates for 5G.

Companies like Intel and Apple with massive financial resources had the ability to do the same but did not. Qualcomm’s royalties are a small fraction of the revenues they enabled for OEM’s like Apple, Samsung and others. Complaints about no license no chips are smoke and mirrors. Why should OEM’s be entitled to the mobile echo system technology without paying the royalty that qualcomm earned and deserves through its investments and inventions? Pay the license royalty and then you are entitled to use the chips that work only because of all that system (network/handset/basestation) technology.

Based on details from the release, we believe Apple’s licensing payment amounts to $7.50/phone, precisely in line with our view following the settlement announcement - and we believe very close to what Apple had been paying (net of rebates) prior to the dispute. In the near-term, that’s being offset by China market weakness (which QCOM believes may reflect a stall ahead of 5G phone availability), and higher expenses (which will improve as legal costs come down). Longer-term, our estimates assume $7.50 in earnings power once they begin to ship Apple chipsets, which can move to ~$8 after a Huawei settlement, presenting an attractive valuation even after the stock’s recent move. ”https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/02/calls-of-the-day-uber-qualcommvisa-estee-lauder-more.html?__source=yahoo%7Cfinance%7Cheadline%7Cstory%7C&par=yahoo&yptr=yahoo",0.9953

The next-generation wireless technology has been seen as a key enabler of Internet of Things products and robotics alike, bringing a new level of high speed wireless across a broad spectrum of connected devices. No wonder, then, that Qualcomm is pushing hard here. The system also supports 4G, just in case. Qualcomm is one of a number of operators looking to get in on the ground level of third-party robotics development. Perhaps most notable among the company’s competition is NVIDIA’s ISAAC platform. But Qualcomm certainly has a lot going for it from the standpoint of components, with a depth of knowledge in connectivity, processing power and AI. It also has a number of high-profile partners already developing for the new platform, including Intel, Panasonic, AirMap, SLAMCORE and ROS gatekeepers, Open Robotics. The system will support a number of third-party components, including Intel’s RealSense depth camera and Panasonic’s TOF (time-of-flight) camera.

Strategy Analytics: Global 5G Smartphone Shipments Will Reach 1.5 Billion in 2025￼Exhibit 1: Global 5G Smartphone Shipments Forecast (Graphic: Strategy Analytics)￼ ￼November 28, 2017 03:00 PM Eastern Standard TimeBOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--According to the latest research from Strategy Analytics, global 5G smartphone shipments will grow from 2 million units in 2019 to reach an impressive 1.5 billion in 2025. The 5G category will be the fastest-growing sector of the global smartphone industry for the next decade. Growth opportunities are huge for companies such as Qualcomm, Intel and Apple.Strategy Analytics says global 5G smartphone shipments will soar from 2 million in 2019 to 1.5 billion in 2025.Tweet thisNeil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, said, “We forecast global 5G smartphone shipments to grow from 2 million units in 2019 to an impressive 1.5 billion in 2025. We forecast global 5G smartphone shipments to grow at an average annual rate of 250 percent between 2019 and 2025. The 5G category will be the fastest-growing sector of the worldwide smartphone industry for the next decade.”Ken Hyers, Director at Strategy Analytics, added, “The next generation of smartphones that can access high-speed 5G mobile networks represents a huge growth opportunity for carriers, infrastructure suppliers, device vendors, chipset makers and software developers. We expect brands such as Qualcomm, Intel, InterDigital, Ericsson, Apple, Samsung, Vodafone and China Mobile to be among the companies at the forefront of the upcoming 5G smartphone wave.”Boris Metodiev, Senior Analyst at Strategy Analytics, added, “We predict the first 5G smartphones to launch commercially in advanced mobile countries such as Japan, South Korea and United States by 2019. However, we caution that 5G technology standards today are not yet market-ready, while previous launches of 3G and 4G smartphones in the past often arrived much later than promised. The smartphone industry is understandably very excited about 5G right now, but history suggests early 5G products may well suffer technical or financial teething problems, and the industry should be prepared for future possible delays in initial smartphone or network launches of several months, perhaps up to a year.”The full report, Global 5G Handset Shipments, Price & Revenue Forecast, is published by the Strategy Analytics Emerging Device Strategies (EDS) service, details of which can be found here: http://tinyurl.com/yd8ugncy.About Strategy Analytics:Strategy Analytics is a global, independent research and consulting firm.

I counted 30!!!EPS guidance will increase more than the $2.Remember with Intel dropping 5g, Qcom will be the only western (USA, Europe, South America) manufacture of 5g chips. Its chips will be used for wearables, IoT, streaming, gaming, selfdriving cars, virtual glasses, healthcare, manufacturing and etc.On top of all that earphones for Alexa, Apple tv and etc... Also AI chips for data centers...Future looks really bright. Target price should be $154 in one year. Simple math P/E of 22 and eps $7.Important to remember also that Qcom made $30 billion buyback with avr price of $60...

Michael Walkley reiterated a Buy rating on Qualcomm (QCOM) and raised his price target to $105 from $89 following the company's Q2 results, saying the Apple (AAPL) licensing agreement is stronger than expected and estimates Qualcomm will receive royalties of roughly $7.50 per iPhone or better than his previous $5 estimate.

Even if Qualcomm just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem.
