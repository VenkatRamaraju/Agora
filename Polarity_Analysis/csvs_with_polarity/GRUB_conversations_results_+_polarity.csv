JET lost about 13% after news came out near the end of June 10 trading day, at current price equivalent of JET USD$97.04, so the equivalent price for GRUB w/b $97.04 / 1.493 = $65.00. Depending on what the arbitrageurs demand as discount, including currency USD/EU fluctuations (USD has been very weak lately, Euro strong) the GRUB price will losely follow that exchange, i.e. at 5% arb discount, GRUB price would be now at about $61.75.From now on, price of money-losing JET and USD/Euro exchange rate are more important than whatever GRUB does.",0.8739

97,"@Westin_Bonaventure ... <->Shurtdown the app for California and fire the 120k contract drivers.<->Correction - they don't need to ""fire"" contract drivers... shutting down apps will leave them without rides, unless they decide to take matters in their own hands and try work with ""flagging"" by negotiating fees on their own - I don't know if it's legal in CA, without license / medallions or other such nonsense.Now, since the State of CA declared these gig workers ""employees"" they can all apply for unemployment insurance, which is going to hit CA double hard - less income from ""gig taxes"" and more expenses for higher unemployment.See how long that stupid AB5 (?) will last intact. Stupid laws should be punished by ""complying"" with them to their logical conclusion.Now, even if AB5 is rescinded or amended in a week or two, that really doesn't say much about long-term future of $UBER or $LYFT, the model is not really workable to make them profitable any time soon, and they will lose any advantage when autonomous vehicles come into our lives - they will be an unnecessary middleman - so certainly will be either out of ""mover"" business or modified at much lower valuations.But that's an argument for another day. The contractor / ""gig"" jobs are the way of the future, way of today really, and CA can't do anything about it.There are ways states may need to protect SOME workers, this is not the industry or the way to do this - when most gig workers have not asked for it - this is just a sop to the unions, who get the money without any real contributions to workers' well-being.",-0.559

166,"WS keeps trying to find reasons to hold money-losing market-share-losing GRUB at nosebleed levels. Rumors of possible potential buyout by AMZN... WMT... KR... seriously? Why not NYC Taxi Service?Just because it MIGHT make sense for UBER / UberEats to ACQUIRE / ELIMINATE A COMPETITOR IN ITS SPACE doesn't mean it make sense for large established companies to get into a new money-losing business just because they have a goods / grocery delivery system and have enough money to do it.AMZN could have built a much better and cheaper delivery platform than GRUB for a lot less than $6B + assumption of debt (> $650M) - they have their own cloud platform and coders up the wazoo (AWS has >60% of cloud market), their own delivery platform, including food delivery (Prime + Whole Food). But they gave it a go in the US, and gave up for very SIMPLE, but FUNDAMENTAL reasons :1. Barriers to entry are pretty low, so they would have to chase every small delivery system in prime locales.2. They couldn't be / become dominating #1, except in a few local markets, SO WHAT'S THE POINT?3. The system is inherently unscalable and so far relies too much on human labor, not automated.4. Even double-dipping by charging both the sellers and the end users, it's hard to make money, even with nominal expenses. GRUB has never had FCF positive year.5. The MOST IMPORTANT POINT is this : all food delivery systems (GRUB, UberEats, DoorDash, Postmates, Waitr, Tock, etc.) are MIDDLEMEN - they DON'T HAVE TOTAL CONTROL of any part of sales chain - what sellers do (access, pricing etc.), what end-users want/expect, what their ""gig"" workers do. They are in-betweens, while AMZN, WMT, KR delivery systems have warehousing (inventory control) -> phone/digital order -> controlled delivery -> (mostly) happy users.Why would any of them want to be IN THE MIDDLE, with no control of sales chain, in TIME-SENSITIVE LOW-MARGINS THIRD-PARTY FOOD DELIVERY BUSINESS with LOW BARRIERS TO ENTRY and no chance of dominance or PRICE LEVERAGE? Even worse, why would they have to pay so much for something they already have for the most part - full scale digital infrastructure and ""gig"" workers are mercenaries - all they need is an order app and maybe another decal on their windshield.Pizza chains and Asian restaurants have long had local delivery systems and mostly satisfied users, at reasonable price and and cost controls.If AMZN ever decides to get into this business in the US again (investment in UK's Deliveroo is different), it would also have to worry about ANTITRUST ISSUES if they become DOMINANT DUE TO INHERENT COST EFFICIENCIES (REUSABLE DIGITAL AND DELIVERY INFRASTRUCTURE) - they already have enough problems with politicos from both parties, on national and some local levels - it's a good ""business"" politically, beating up on a giant, be it WMT or AMZN. That may have been the primary reason why after tryout they decided to kill Amazon Restaurants in first place.",0.9979

RESTAURANT PULLBACK could rebalance the food supply chain.Americans have rapidly changed the ways they buy, cook and eat food in just four months, leaving everyone from farmers to restaurants unable to match their pivot.U.S. consumers, whose previous food preferences were stable enough that farmers could often make reliable planting decisions years in advance, have shifted their habits at fast pace during the coronavirus pandemic. That includes COOKING MORE AT HOME, purchasing in bulk, FORGOING BRAND-NAME TREATS and eating SMALLER MEALS due to FEWER TRIPS TO RESTAURANTS with their often oversized portions.Even one of those changes by itself could throw a wrench in the global food supply chain. ADD ALL FIVE TOGETHER, and some suppliers are finding they can't adapt fast enough to keep pace with all the changing consumer demands. Farmers, like a lettuce grower in California, have been forced to destroy crops after restaurant demand dried up.The ways Americans are changing their food habits are not only MULTIPLE AND SIGNIFICANT — they're also POTENTIALLY PERMANENT.Almost a THIRD OF U.S. ADULTS SAY THEY PLAN TO COOK AT HOME EVEN MORE THAN THEY DO NOW, ONCE STAY-AT-HOME RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE LIFTED. Home-kitchen purchases back that up: In the early weeks of the pandemic, U.S. sales of electric pasta makers grew more than five times what they were a year prior. Breadmaker sales more than quadrupled. More than a quarter of adults purchased items in bulk more often. BRANDS have also fallen out of favor, as 23% of respondents said they purchased GENERIC or store brands more often. In fact, 16% of Americans plan to buy private-label or bulk items even more frequently once the pandemic ends.As consumers cook more at home, driving up grocery store sales, they're STEERING CLEAR OF RESTAURANTS. ===$SHAK $GRUB $UBER",0.9813

UberEats went from an asset to a liability for the company because it is unprofitable and Uber's stock is down 30 percent since it went public,"" Ives said. ===----India is a first testbed.

""Digital + delivery"" added about 25% to average orders so that can't last long, especially with many now being semi-permanently laid-off / unemployed or WFH with cut in pay and additional work-related expenses - and that's with very generous unemployment benefits that are about to expire or be cut substantially while gov't keep borrowing and printing $Trillion$ of green stuff.=== 07-22-2020 One thing Tesla does have going for it is a constellation of COMMENTATORS WILLING TO SING ITS PRAISES TO INFINITY AND BEYOND, though their convictions can appear shallow.

897,"08-18-2020 === Online ordering and food-delivery company Grubhub ($GRUB) reported its second-quarter 2020 results on July 30, highlighting SPECTACULAR GROSS FOOD SALES for partner restaurants, EXPLOSIVE GROWTH IN DINERS and ""Daily Average Grubs,"" and other positive, coronavirus-driven metrics. But ITS BALLOONING REVENUES LED IN THE END TO EIGHT-FIGURE QUARTERLY NET LOSSES. If Grubhub CAN'T ACHIEVE A NET PROFIT EVEN WITH COVID-19'S TREMENDOUS DELIVERY SALES BOOST, can it turn profitable once it merges with Just Eat Takeaway ($TKAYY)?ON THE SURFACE, some of Grubhub's most recent quarterly results look outstanding, as people dined at home to avoid coronavirus infection. According to its Q2 2020 release, the delivery company's gross food sales metric blazed upward 59% year over year, reaching $2.3 billion and leaving Q2 2019's gross food sales of $1.5 billion in the rearview mirror. REVENUE WAS UP 41% TO $459.3 MILLION, ACTIVE DINERS ROSE 35% TO 27.5 MILLION PEOPLE.After totaling up the costs, however, it becomes apparent that MAKING A RECORD NUMBER OF DELIVERIES APPEARS TO BE A LOSING PROPOSITION under Grubhub's current model. Total COSTS AND EXPENSES rose 60% year over year, STRONGLY OUTPACING REVENUE GROWTH. Rather than earning net income of $0.03 on each order placed through its platform as in Q2 2019, the company lost $0.77 per order.Similar to Grubhub's situation, the COVID-19 pandemic added rocket fuel to Just Eat Takeaway's sales and revenue. According to its Aug. 12 press release on half-year 2020 results, the respiratory virus propelled Just Eat's ORDERS FOR THE PERIOD UPWARD BY 32% YEAR OVER YEAR, reaching 257 million orders.REVENUES PREDICTABLY TRACKED HIGHER IN SYNC WITH MORE ORDERS, JUMPING 44% YEAR OVER YEAR for the period ending June 30, reaching 1.03 billion euros ($1.2 billion) compared to 2019's 715 million euros ($849 million). The COST OF SALES ROSE FASTER, INCREASING 64%; GROWTH IN STAFF COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES, among others, led to a 156 million euros ($185 million) total comprehensive loss in 2020, compared to a 28 million euro ($33.2 million) loss during 2019's first half.A PERIOD OF LIGHTNING-FAST DELIVERY GROWTH LED TO A 464% INCREASE IN LOSSES FOR JUST EAT. In its notes to the tabulated revenues and expenses, JUST EAT CONFIRMS REPEATEDLY THAT ITS DELIVERY SUCCESS DROVE ITS PROFITABILITY FAR INTO NEGATIVE TERRITORY. It says its runaway COST OF SALES ""was primarily driven by continued expansion of our delivery service offering"" and notes the 31% JUMP IN STAFF COSTS, a separate expense category from cost of sales.Both companies appear to OPERATE IN A SIMILAR WAY: THE MORE DELIVERIES THEY MAKE AND THE BIGGER THEIR UP-FRONT REVENUES, THE MORE THEY END UP LOSING DURING THE QUARTER BECAUSE OF DELIVERY EXPENSES OUTSTRIPPING THOSE SAME REVENUES. A situation of explosive growth in restaurant deliveries, which seems as though it would create a paradise of profit for big delivery companies, instead DEEPENS THEIR LOSSES. The food delivery industry is also notorious for aggressive promotional activity.Simply tossing Just Eat Takeaway and Grubhub into the same mixing bowl via a merger seems unlikely to cook up significantly different results at this point. Both continue pursuing the SAME BUSINESS MODEL, and merely joining forces as one business entity won't change the basic recipe.While some ANALYSTS or commentators SPECULATE on ways the pair could boost their bottom line into positive territory... neither company has hinted at taking such measures, which remain SPECULATIVE AND UNPROVEN ANYWAY.[Investors] may want to avoid both based on their loss-generating strategies. ===Exactly the same goes for Uber Eats and its merger partner Postmates, and we'll soon find out the same about Doordash ($DOORD) - it's a race to the bottom, not to the green bottom line. The more they sell the more money they lose. Of course, the more money they lose, the higher Price Targets the ""analysts"" give them.Notice how many MONEY-LOSING COMPANIES are filing for IPO or SPAC (Special Purpose Acquision Company) and/or gobbling piles of ""cheap"" debt while the financial system is choking on ""free"" liquidity just waiting to be put to use somewhere?$UBER $GRUB $DOORD $SHAK $TSLA",0.9993

""That means that funds to restart, PAY BACK RENT and buy inventory are exhausted, leaving tens of thousands of entrepreneurs at risk. Business owners face HIGH RENTS, REGULATORY BURDENS and TAXES.""""COVID-19 has changed the value proposition, since PREVIOUS ADVANTAGES SUCH AS FOOT TRAFFIC AND EASY ACCESS TO THE OFFICES OF CLIENTS AND POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS HAVE DIMINISHED. On the contrary, over the past decade, political forces have created a much more expensive and litigious environment for business that is no longer sustainable for those whose margins were narrow before the pandemic,"" report said.City has 18 percent unemployment rate, although there's a shortage of skilled workers in areas like accounting and business development. 54 percent of city jobs CAN BE DONE REMOTELY with some NYC companies no longer requiring new hires to live in state. Raising taxes for the wealthy could push the city's highest earners — who account for 40 percent of the state's tax revenue — to move elsewhere. ===---=== 07-20-2020 Mortgage payments may be a challenge as $600 unemployment bump nears expiration. More than half of mortgage borrowers experienced INCOME LOSS DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. Forty percent of mortgage borrowers said either themselves or someone in their household has been receiving unemployment benefits. The $600 unemployment bump has helped buoy many households' financial situations throughout the pandemic. In fact, studies have shown BENEFITS FOR 68 PERCENT OF WORKERS WOULD EXCEED EARNINGS.However, facing income loss, Americans said they would be most willing to default on their mortgage payments as a means to make ends meet than other debt payments. Meanwhile, millions of Americans continue to file NEW UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS each week. ""To avoid a SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN CONSUMER SPENDING once the $600 bonus expires, either the economy will have to create a lot of jobs very quickly or we need more fiscal support.""Unless the government intends to spend several hundred billion dollars to further support personal income, the ability for people out of work to support themselves has disappeared for millions of workers. There is an illusion that an 11% unemployment rate is a victory after the 14.7% one in April. The fact is that 10% unemployment was the worst monthly level of the Great Recession. The economy was in horrible shape even when the number was 8%. So, if the current level remains over 8%, the economy is in a shambles.The END OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT IS NOT THE WORST PROBLEM. If confirmed COVID-19 cases continue to rise by as much as 70,000 a day, the crisis will shutter much of the economy for a second time. Some epidemiologists believe another wave of cases will start in October. It will be, by many accounts, worse than the first one, given a widespread and often undetected COVID-19 infected population throughout the country.The stock markets cannot rise much more under these levels of pressure. The pullback in the early part of this year took the Dow Jones industrial average from 28,000 to 19,000 in a matter of weeks.

That said, we remain confident in our current strategy and our recent initiatives to support restaurants in this challenging environment.”Meanwhile Uber wrote: “We are constantly looking at ways to provide more value to our customers, across all of the businesses we operate.” The company added: “We have shown ourselves to be disciplined with capital and we do not respond to speculative M&A premiums.”According to Bloomberg, an agreement could be reached as early as this month. The news sent Grubhub shares surging 38%, before closing Tuesday’s trading 29% higher.Overall, Wall Street analysts have a bullish outlook on Uber stock with 26 Buys, 2 Holds and 1 Sell- giving UBER its Strong Buy consensus. The $39.59 average price target indicates 22% upside potential lies ahead. Shares are currently trading up 9% on a year-to-date basis. (See Uber stock analysis on TipRanks).“Clearly this would be an aggressive move by Uber to take out a major competitor on the Uber Eats front and further consolidate its market position, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to shift more of a focus to deliveries vs. ride sharing in the near-term,” Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian wrote in a report to investors on May 12.He also added that he “wouldn’t rule out a bidding war with DoorDash.”",0.9981

If the purchase price of GRUB is set to, let's say at $6B (stock only, w/ debt not included) then when UBER stock price is going UP, the ratio is going down to match the cost - IOW, GRUB receives less stock from UBER. If the debt is included in the $6B purchase, then it needs to be subtracted from the total purchase price - and so even fewer UBER shares will have to be exchanged for every GRUB share. The exchange ratio moves with UBER's stock price, it's not fixed until the EOD of the deal, if it happens. Considering the debt GRUB carries, this would be a major valuation roadblock, as UBER already has a lot of debt, and just got nearly $1B more. That alone could shave a number of points from ratio. Another problem with this deal that no one talks about, is that there is significant overlap in the cities served by both UberEats and GRUB, and delivery businesses are not scalable so adding more drivers and having a near monopoly in certain areas will greatly increase anti-trust issues and local restrictions, like in NYC. This is not such a great deal for UBER in that it may not be able to gain significant market share the way it may look ""on paper"" at first glance.",0.9886

In the class action lawsuit filed in federal court this week, the company is also accused of using ""sketchy"" tactics to conceal the identity of drivers picking up the unverified restaurant orders.Two restaurants filed the federal lawsuit on behalf of TENS OF THOUSANDS of others whose NAMES AND LOGOS IT CLAIMS HAD BEEN ADDED to Grubhub's platform without permission. Though the practice was OUTLAWED IN CALIFORNIA LAST MONTH, it is still widely used by SEVERAL THIRD-PARTY DELIVERY COMPANIES (UberEats, Doordash, Postmates).According to the lawsuit, Grubhub instructed drivers to ""ACT AS IF THEY WERE A DINER"" PICKING UP AN ORDER. Moreover, the drivers were allegedly treated as third-party pawns who were not only tasked with delivering orders to the customers but also figuring out how to place them in the first place.So how is it even possible for Grubhub to pick up an order from a restaurant to be delivered without the establishment's knowledge? ""The order doesn't go directly to the restaurant. It goes instead to a Grubhub driver, who must first figure out how to contact the restaurant and place the order. This often lead to mistakes in customers' orders and often the restaurant won't receive the order at all.""The practice went beyond innocently expanding the platform's searchable database with non-partner restaurants, which is how CEO Grubhub's Matt Maloney seemingly presented it last October. According to the plaintiffs, the delivery platform hurt their business by listing NONEXISTENT MENU ITEMS AND WRONG PRICES. Sometimes, they would allegedly even list RESTAURANTS THAT DON'T OFFER TAKEOUT.The lawsuit is asking for Grubhub to end its practice of adding non-partner restaurants, pay damages, and ""turn over its ill-gotten gains."" ===This also explains why some drivers have to wait for the ""orders"" or why the food is made for instant ""takeout"", not for ""delivery"" that can take 30-50 minutes to get to customer.",0.986

I wonder if Jitse Groen who now owns less than 11% of JET stock was forthcoming with his BOD, or he has the blank check to play with funny money that the rising European stock markets afforded his recently merged company.And As if GRUB didn't have enough problems, now there is a new lawsuit from Yum! because GRUB management can't stop doing dumb things like pixsing off a huge customer that bought a $200M stake in the company in 2018, to cement a five year deal to deliver food for Taco Bell and KFC (Pizza Hut, like most pizzerias, has its own delivery network). Sure, the food delivery companies don't make any money off large customers, but then what were they thinking before?Now GRUB cancels the deal on June 2 (wonder if UBER's Dara knew about it and didn't want to deal with yet another problem courtesy of GRUB pixsing off existing and potential Uber Eats customers).Yum Brands accused GrubHub of LINING ITS POCKETS by ditching a contract it no longer wanted, duh! In turn, GrubHub accused Yum of breaching terms of their deal ""by direct technological integrations between Yum systems and Uber Eats and Postmates, and integration of operations and logistics"" - seriously?Don't see how GRUB can win this, unless the deal was exclusive, which is very unlikely - GrubHub is not the only service that can deliver food. Low barriers to entry guarantee that more companies would enter the field if it shrunk and it could be proved that it can run profitably. Maybe that JET $144M breakup fee could come in handy when it's time to pay the piper for doing stupid things like breaking the contracts. And trying to smear one of your largest customers and POCKET THE MONEY AFTER BREAKING THE CONTRACT is not going to enhance already the worst reputation of food delivery companies. 06-12-2020",0.9785

In their letter, the lawmakers said the deal would give Uber and Grubhub 48 percent of the U.S. market, while Doordash would have 42 percent. A merged Uber Eats and Grubhub would have 79 percent of the market in New York, 68 percent in Boston, 65 percent in Miami, 60 percent in Chicago and 51 percent in Atlanta. “We have been hearing about the exorbitant fees that these online delivery app companies charge to restaurants, which are then forced to pass these excessive costs on to consumers,” the lawmakers wrote.

The stock is now at the same $110-to-$115 per share levels where it was prior to the earnings release and guidance on July 25. And then it shot up to $135/share. Nothing has changed since then. Yes Grubhub faces market competition from multiple players including Uber Eats and Doordash. But the overall addressable market is $150 billion so enough highway for growth for multiple players in the near term. I would have been more worried if the stock had been $146/share (Sep 14 high) going into earnings. But at the current price, there is the ability for management to reconfirm Grub Hub's bright prospects and for this stock to rally up. From a technical perspective, Grub Hub is way oversold: The 7-day RSI is 15, the 14-day CMO is a negative 55, and the 14-day ADX is 27.

1691,"One of the problems is that the few large markets that don't already have cheaper and more efficient local delivery options (like most pizzerias and Asian food businesses do) are already SATURATED with end-users who are considering or now using delivery, so more partners / restaurants don't really give you more of the market - i.e., ""market"" is not restaurants, it's a finite percentage of population that accepts ""delivery at a cost"" - some might try ""delivery for free"" but otherwise delivery is just an app of dining options people may look through to choose from, given generally unsatisfying experience with the food delivered via Big Four / Big Three - ""cold"" / ""takes too long"" / ""order mistakes"" / ""expensive"" etc.IOW all the partnership pronouncements are great, but the number / percentage of end-users is not going to grow much from here, and might even start shrinking soon. So it's one of those UNSCALABLE business models where the more you sell the more money you lose... unless of course, nobody (WS ""influencers"" / boosters in the finmedia / sell-side analysts) cares about profitability, i.e. it's a ""hope trade"" like WeWork and bunch of other ""growth"" companies that EVENTUALLY went bankrupt but enriched insiders and WS investment banks in the process.=== 07-06-2020 There is a cartoon version of certain gig-economy startup industries that goes like this. SEVERAL COMPANIES GET INTO THE MARKET FOR, SAY, CAR SERVICES OR FOOD DELIVERY OR WHATEVER. They compete for MARKET SHARE BY LOSING A LOT OF MONEY: You pay drivers $20 per trip, which is more than they could get elsewhere; you charge riders $5 per trip, which is less than they'd pay elsewhere; you MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE BY RAISING MONEY FROM VENTURE CAPITALISTS OR SOFTBANK. YOUR COMPETITORS DO THE SAME THING, AND YOU COLLECTIVELY SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF VENTURE MONEY DELIVERING PEOPLE CHEAP BURRITOS. You promise your investors ""don't worry, after a few more cheap burritos we will drive our competitors out of business and we'll be able to jack up the burrito prices to cover our expenses,"" but YOUR COMPETITORS ARE PROMISING THEIR INVESTORS THE SAME THING — SOMETIMES IT'S THE SAME INVESTORS! — so they all keep hanging around.EVENTUALLY everyone does get tired of this, but RATHER THAN GOING OUT OF BUSINESS with nothing to show for it, the LESS VIABLE COMPETITORS GET ACQUIRED by the more viable ones. If you are a leading player in this sort of viciously competitive business, it can be worth a few billion dollars to you to get rid of a competitor: With less competition, maybe you can charge a bit more to deliver burritos and can REDUCE THE PAIN A LITTLE BIT.If you believe this model ... then 1 + 1 = 3, water flows uphill, you can be your own grandfather, anything is possible. It is a PERPETUAL-MOTION MACHINE OF IMPLAUSIBLE CONSEQUENCES.You can LOSE MONEY EVERY STEP OF THE WAY, AND NEVER CONVINCE ANYONE THAT YOU'LL EVER MAKE MONEY, AND STILL EXIT WITH MORE MONEY THAN YOU STARTED WITH. PRESENT PROFITABILITY DOESN'T MATTER, FUTURE PROFITABILITY DOESN'T MATTER, all that matters is harming the profitability of an even more lavishly funded money-losing competitor.That is: In the short term, it might be in your interest to acquire competitors and reduce the pain. But in the LONG TERM, WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU ARE DEMONSTRATING THAT ""LOSE MONEY UNTIL WE GET ACQUIRED AT A PREMIUM"" IS A VIABLE BUSINESS MODEL, SO YOU'LL BE ENCOURAGING OTHER PEOPLE TO JUMP INTO THE SECTOR WITHOUT A PLAN TO MAKE MONEY, AND YOU'LL HAVE TO KEEP BUYING THEM.You CAN'T REALLY BELIEVE THE MODEL. Venture capitalists MIGHT SUBSIDIZE LOSSES for 10 years, but not for 100; EVENTUALLY there has to be some sort of endgame.Possibly the endgame is ""people come to their senses, the INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATES, and the REMAINING PLAYERS FIND A WAY TO MAKE MONEY."" Possibly the endgame is ""people come to their senses, ALL THESE COMPANIES SHUT DOWN, AND WE GO BACK TO PICKING UP OUR OWN BURRITOS."" Obviously if you're invested in the space you are telling the former story, not the latter.Uber Technologies is acquiring Postmates for about $2.65 billion in stock, combining two U.S. FOOD-DELIVERY services. Pretty much everyone takes the view, well, Uber Eats loses money, and Postmates loses money, but IF THEY COMBINE THEY'LL LOSE A LITTLE BIT LESS MONEY.This view is so much the CONSENSUS that I half-expected Uber's announcement to be like ""this acquisition will LESSEN COMPETITION IN THE SECTOR SO WE CAN STOP LOSING SO MUCH MONEY."" Obviously you can't SAY ""WE ARE DOING THIS DEAL TO REDUCE COMPETITION BECAUSE OUR BUSINESS IS NOT REALLY VIABLE,"" even if it's what everyone thinks.This made me want to get into the food delivery business. Postmates has raised about $900 million of venture capital and DOESN'T SEEM TO BE PROFITABLE, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE MADE A LOT OF MONEY OFF OF IT ANYWAY. Maybe there's room for more of that. ===The big word and big question of course is, when is EVENTUALLY?$UBER $GRUB",0.9995

However, the right results and guidance in the earnings report by Grub Hub will trump the interest-rate impact - and take this stock to $150/share before year end. Here's why I'm bullish: (1) Grub Hub has little debt and doesn't need to raise material debt in the foreseeable future (2) There is no recession in sight for 2019, so consumer spending will remain strong (3) The addressable market for food delivery is conservatively at least $100 billion in the US - to date, Grub Hub has penetrated barely 1% of this market so there is a long runway for growth. Grub Hub can easily grow revenue by 40-to-50% next year (the analyst consensus for 2019 revenue growth is ~30%). That doesn't mean you shouldn't hedge the near term with puts (I have puts protecting my long position). But the prospects for this company and the stock are bright through 2019 (I say ""2019"" because a possible recession showing up in 2020 could result in consumers cutting back on discretionary spending and creating a temporary hiccup during a recession and related bear market).",0.7605

Doordash has 42% market, GRUB has 28%, UBER has 20% - GRUBER would have nearly half the market - there is a clear antitrust issue here that wouldn't resolve quickly anyway, and UBER's new debt raise of $750M doesn't even start to buy GRUB at $6B valuation - more likely is the play for much smaller Postmates... at which point GRUB will crash.",0.7285

I sat and waiting 25 minutes to pickup an order, while there are 4 GH orders ready to be picked up and sitting there for 30 minutes.

The charges have been so blatantly wrong, that Grub has offered to credit the amounts back a few months, but these have been occurring for years in some cases.

They have hired a financial adviser to properly value the company and present options. The options likely are merge with another company, buy another company, or sell the company.

UBER is going on the offensive TO STEAL its former potential partner's Big Apple clients. (No honor among thieves!)Starting on Tuesday, UBER's food delivery arm, Uber Eats, began telling NYC eateries that it will WAIVE MARKETING FEES AND ALL OTHER NON-DELIVERY FEES THROUGH OCT. 31 — a promotion that sources say could help Uber pick off Grubhub's restaurant clients in its largest market of NYC.""That's a way to take share away from Grubhub,"" one industry insider said, noting that the MAJORITY OF GRUBHUB'S NYC CUSTOMERS TEND TO HANDLE THEIR OWN DELIVERY and stand to pay zero commissions through October if they switch to Uber. Uber will still charge a 15 percent commission for food deliveries. And since the VAST MAJORITY OF UBER EATS' EXISTING CLIENTS TEND TO RELY ON IT FOR DELIVERY, the promotion will only cost it about one-quarter of its total NYC revenues.Big Apple restaurateurs say they could sorely use the savings, especially with sales having plummeted due to coronavirus lockdowns that have largely shuttered sit-down dining operations. Dan Abrams, who operates JG Melon on the Upper West Side, said he will start using Uber. ""At this point, EVERYTHING IS A SIMPLE MATH EQUATION about how I can SAVE MORE MONEY,"" said Abrams, who has been using Grubhub and its Seamless unit for deliveries during the pandemic. ===The heat is on!

The willingness of Grubhub to ASSUME ADDITIONAL COSTS to gain new business underscores the HARSH COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS OF THE FOOD-DELIVERY FIGHT.Lyft chose a partnership route RATHER THAN FUNDING ITS OWN FOOD-DELIVERY BUSINESS because it wanted to AVOID what Lyft co-founder and President John Zimmer has called the ""CONTINUED GROWING LOSSES"" by KEY PLAYERS IN THE FOOD DELIVERY BUSINESS.UNLESS FOOD DELIVERY BECOMES A PROFITABLE PROPOSITION, Lyft appears smart not to build its own business. ===-----""ALL WORK AND NO PAY make food delivery a poor business""""I see UNENDING GROWING LOSSES for the rest of your business life."" - ""Don't worry, we'll MAKE IT UP IN VOLUME!""$GRUB $LYFT $UBER $TKAYY",0.9968

Price target slashed to a Street-low view of $30 from $98.“The food delivery market is increasingly irrational as competitors flood the market,” making customers less loyal to any particular company. The company’s “answer to this irrationality, however, seems confusing: its management letter seems to suggest that it will double down on its competitors’ poor economic decisions,” including free delivery for quick service restaurants.These strategies “should attract customers with lower order frequency and less lifetime value, reducing [long-term] profitability while providing little real growth.”Craig-Hallum Capital Group, Alex FuhrmanThe outlook “creates a bleaker picture in the short-term.”Decelerating revenue growth, along with Ebitda pressures, “creates a challenged environment for the stock, with investors now likely needing to see a stabilization in revenue growth coupled with improved profitability.”Downgrades to hold from buy, price target cut to $40 from $100.Jefferies, Brent ThillThe weaker-than-expected third-quarter results are “the least of the issues,” given the “drastically reduced” outlook and the “aggressive spending” to reinvigorate growth. The spending plan “makes sense given the circumstance,” but “there is no guarantee that it will change the overall narrative.”The company “has turned into a revenue deceleration story with compressing margins all in the face of increased competition, not a great recipe for success.” Expects increased consolidation in the food-delivery sector, but this is “a challenging industry to truly differentiate (especially against two deep-pocketed competitors).”Hold rating, price target cut to $45 from $78.Stephens, Will SlabaughThere is a business case to be made for increasing investments in order to protect market share, but “this significantly pushes out the earnings story and again sets up GRUB as a ‘show me’ stock for 2020.”Currently has an overweight rating and $110 price target, but the view is under review.Cowen, Thomas Champion“The growth and profitability picture looks much worse than we previously thought,” with “multiple headwinds” cited as cause for concern.Management’s commentary “suggests tempered expectations make sense, with future growth coming from areas like take-out and driving lower diner-facing fees.”Outperform, $86 price target.BTIG, Peter Saleh“We struggle to find any silver lining in these developments,” and the slowdown “has caught us by surprise.”“We are unclear as to the path forward from here,” although industry consolidation is likely.Affirms buy rating, and $95 price target, but adds that estimates are under review until the conference call.Wedbush, Ygal ArounianThe outlook represents “a full-on kitchen sink moment as GrubHub finally gives in to competitive dynamics.”While investors had been bracing for a weak outlook, “it certainly was not at this order of magnitude.” This is “clearly a full reset of expectations,” and GrubHub management “will face a steep climb in an effort to regain Street credibility.”Despite the “decidedly negative” report, affirms outperform rating and $90 price target pending the conference call.",0.9972

Last October, CEO Matt Maloney said the company would be piloting a new initiative of adding more restaurants to its searchable database without entering into an official partnership with them, SO CUSTOMERS WOULD BELIEVE THEY HAD MORE DELIVERY OPTIONS WITH GRUBHUB, AND WOULDN'T SWITCH TO COMPETITORS.Sometimes it's possible to place orders with the restaurant by phone, but other times the restaurant will only accept orders in person. The extra steps often lead to mistakes in customers' orders and often the restaurant won't receive the order at all."" GRUBHUB ALSO WOULDN'T WARN RESTAURANTS BEFORE THEY WERE LISTED, WHICH LED TO RESTAURANTS SUDDENLY BEING INUNDATED WITH GRUBHUB ORDERS THEY NEVER EXPECTED, and leads customers to become frustrated with service the restaurant never agreed to provide in the first place. And both restaurants say the language Grubhub uses suggests a partnership that doesn't exist,.Grubhub declined to comment to Eater about the lawsuit. Last year, a Grubhub representative told Eater IT WAS ADDING RESTAURANTS WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION, putting the onus on any restaurant owner to proactively check Grubhub to be sure their business isn't being listed. However, according to the lawsuit, Grubhub has not removed the restaurants from its site, DESPITE MULTIPLE REQUESTS TO DO SO. ===Add to that $200Mln lawsuit from YUM for ""breach of contract"" and Just Eat Takeaway is going to be very unhappy with their takeover of extremely dishonest and fraudulent money-losing company with lots of debt, adding to their own money-losing operations and debt load.",0.9741

They run their company like Scientology only now their public & regulators are all over Uber...,-0.5885
2474,"Reason WTRH is a steal here for a very limited time till others realize how it all works. Some people don't understand college students, medical offices,any office type, factory. Those wanting delivery of places that don't deliver. Drivers drive for lyft and uber at same time.(you might have seen both sticker decals on same 4 door or suv.) They have to accept each delivery. That is why those who deliver door dash, also deliver for uber eats, grub hub, or even post mates,(some of them). Some use two platforms, others 4 or more. When waitr app gets just a little more known to the masses (almost there) by online ad blitz and the right promo running by waitr, you won't be able to stop this stock.MM won't be able to hold it down. You know why? Zero loyalty. Whoever pays the best and keeps the perks the most simple at the time usually a month at a time is who they switch to and drive for. I have seen the proof, plus it just takes one big chain, like say chipotle to say we only use waitr ,or this month we are giving waiter a"" trial run"". Postmates all over internet but they never delivered me anything. The waitr app is clean and simple than the others which will cary it far. It is far cleaner app than both uber and door dash and hanging right there with Grubhub. All cities are different habits and circumstances. (Some have weallthier customers, but it is harder or longer to get around a city.Which is why some promos make something worth it, (when it hardly was before, worth the effort) Download waitr app for delivery or driving and you'll see quality and know these guys are sticking around. We are lucky people get impatient and stock went to 20 cents, but it's not like many at all bought there in that range for instance. This is trending because it is here to stay. Waitr has 10,000 employees, it is about finding that sweet spot for the right amount of profit without pissing off the customers or restaurants. Mom and pop restaurants of chinese, mexican, italian like door dash, waitr but not grubhub and uber eats. But in close proximities, they do well like nyc. Spread out urban and or some rural, midwest, country, they excel at. Many things look like a big mess, until the public learns them or catches on. So many eyes are on wtrh. So many have put it in there watchlist and are just waiting till they see it start to move again and they ill jump on board. Panic buying for fear of being left out is not too far off inmo.",0.9957

That is how you make fast money in the stock market. Some traders think this system works just as well going Long. Pure Earnings Long plays. No. It does NOT. To score 75-80% wins and double-quadruple your money every year, you MUST do this system to the Short side. Anyway, I immediately pumped all my $$ into another Pure Earnings Short play. My newest Bloated Baby is COLM. Short a lot of shares at $113.17. Stock continues to go up into the close right now, but I feel VERY happy and confident in this Pure Earnings Short play. COLM is due to report earnings at 4:05 PM ET and I think the ER will be quite DECENT. But at the same time I think the stock will still sell off tomorrow in a significant way, because it is just HUGELY, GROSSLY, over-valued. Understand the psychology of the smartest trade and WHY I chose COLM to Short: If the ER is BAD this stock is poised to go down 5-15% tomorrow. If the ER is GOOD COLM is still poised to go down 3-6% tomorrow. If the ER is GREAT COLM is still poised to trade tomorrow between 2% down and 5% up. So, I am ""risking"" a 5% maximum loss, in exchange for a 75-80% chance of a winning trade, and the possibility of a 15% gain. This is how I succeed big as a trader. Good Luck Folks! :-)",0.9982

TDD is just FAR too overvalued and toppy at $300+ a share and I think they will NOT meet their consensus estimates.

""It's a really, really big deal, we think, for us, and for the world,"" said Waymo CEO John Krafcik.Any existing Waymo One customer can hail a driverless minivan from a fleet of more than 300. The vehicles will be operating in a smaller, roughly 50-square-mile service area. Passengers are free to invite friends and family and to share their experiences on social media. Waymo plans to open THE SERVICE TO NEW CUSTOMERS WITHIN A FEW WEEKS. ""At that point, we'll have general access to anyone who chooses to download the app,"" Krafcik said.""For the next several weeks, perhaps a month or more, every ride, 100% of our rides with Waymo One, will be FULLY DRIVERLESS,"" said Krafcik. He declined to say when Waymo planned to introduce robo-taxis in other cities, but did hint at where it might go next: ""We'd love the OPPORTUNITY TO BRING the Waymo One driver to our home STATE OF CALIFORNIA."" ====== 10-10-2020 Car design is about to change forever.As Israeli startup Ree demonstrates, the EV of tomorrow is basically just a GIANT SKATEBOARD. With tiny motors placed inside the wheels, the car can assume any form imaginable; any sort of seating or storage arrangement can be built right on top of this flat base.Traditional gas cars were built atop a flat chassis, too. But that chassis was hardly so self contained. Components like your engine and steering system are on top. Then the motor propels a complex series of axles under the car. Of course you have brakes, suspension, cooling systems, gas lines, and other systems to snake around, too. It all adds up to 30,000 parts which are screwed, pressed, glued, and welded together.Ree is one of several manufacturers working on an alternative platform. Peers include automotive mainstays like VW, newer startups like Rivian, and even Tesla. But Ree's new video, seen here, is the first time I've witnessed the odd spectacle of these flat chassis whipping around a track with no other filigree attached.The smallest is a nimble EV made for tight turns and SMALL CARGO DELIVERIES FOR LAST-MILE DELIVERY SERVICES. The MEDIUM IS FOR TRANSPORTING GOODS AND PEOPLE SHORT DISTANCES. AND THE LARGEST YOU SEE IS A FULL CLASS 1 VEHICLE–A TYPICAL CAR OR DELIVERY VAN.Ree's technology has already been licensed by Toyota for the Japanese car maker's electric truck subsidiary Hino. Hino detailed how this platform could power small city buses... but also beauticians and doctor offices on wheels. Hino even went so far as to detail a mount, which would allow these modular ""service spaces"" to pop on and off the chassis at will.DELIVERY GIANTS like Amazon are interested in these ELECTRIC SKATEBOARDS TO POWER DELIVERY FLEETS, as it just revealed new electric vans built atop a similar electric platform made by Rivian. For Amazon to have 100,000 EVs on the road by 2030, it needs these vehicles to be SIMPLE TO REPAIR, WITH INTEROPERABLE PARTS. THE SKATEBOARD DESIGN ENSURES A DELIVERY VEHICLE IS NEVER OUT OF COMMISSION FOR LONG. ===---If you can just send YOUR OWN car to pick up (or deliver) food / groceries / friends, then there's much less need for other and expensive intermediaries like Uber, Lyft, Grubhub, Doordash etc.10-12-2020 $UBER $LYFT $GRUB $TKAYY",0.9993
