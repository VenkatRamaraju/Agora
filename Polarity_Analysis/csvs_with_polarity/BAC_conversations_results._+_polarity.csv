Trump has made it clear that he views the return of American hostages as a priority and regularly touts his success,” Joel Simon, the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and author of “We Want to Negotiate: The Secret World of Kidnapping, Hostages and Ransom,” told Fox News. “The hostage families I speak with appreciate the attention the President gives the issue, but some policy experts worry that the same attention could increase the risk by making clear the potential value of American hostages.”To date, at least 21 hostages held abroad have been freed throughout Trump’s first term. They range from a former CIA officer, Sabrina de Sousa, who was held in Portugal for more than 18 months at the request of Italian prosecutors and an Egyptian-American charity worker Aya Hijazi who was imprisoned in Cairo for three years.

Behind locked doors with lots of armed guards securing the scene. Viola, dollar bills! Bank notes! Well...they ain't real money, though, are they? Look at the print on your dollar bill. It says ""Legal tender for all debts..."" Backed, of course, by the full faith in American's abillity to (re)pay. So it's a debt note, not anything of real value like a hard asset such as gold. But I digress. They whirled away printing paper and there's your money. But now, all they need to do is open a spreadsheet, add a couple of zero's to a ""total sum"" field and then hit save. VIOLA! New money! MMT made real. MMT theorists must be in orgiastic heaven over all of it, eh? Meanwhile the debt keeps being loaded onto your back. So I've got to ask. Are you feeling like Sisyphus yet? Loaded down and pushing that (debt) boulder up hills...forever?",0.99

2232,"Travelers - The fragile legacy of Barack ObamaElaine KamarckFriday, April 6, 2018It becomes clearer every day that Barack Obama, a historic president, presided over a somewhat less than historic presidency. With only one major legislative achievement (Obamacare)—and a fragile one at that—the legacy of Obama’s presidency mainly rests on its tremendous symbolic importance and the fate of a patchwork of executive actions.How much of that was due to fate and how much was due to Obama’s own shortcomings as a politician is up for debate and is a question that emerges from Princeton historian Julian Zelizer’s new edited volume, The Presidency of Barack Obama.With contributions from seventeen historians, the book bills itself as “a first historical assessment” of the Obama presidency. The overwhelming consensus, Zelizer writes, is that Obama “turned out to be a very effective policymaker but not a tremendously successful party builder.” This “defining paradox of Obama’s presidency” comes up again and again: the historians, by and large, approve of Obama’s policies (although some find them too timid) while they lament his politics.The politics were pretty disastrous. As Zelizer summarizes, “During his presidency, even as he enjoyed reelection and strong approval ratings toward the end of this term, the Democratic Party suffered greatly. . . . Democrats lost more than one thousand seats in state legislatures, governors’ mansions, and Congress during his time in office.” Zelizer could have gone further. According to Ballotpedia, more Democratic state legislative seats were lost under Obama than under any president in modern history. In short he was a big disappointment to most Americans.",0.9533

2445,"Bank of America Profit Doubles -- 2nd Update -- 8:39 am ET April 15, 2021 Bank of America Corp. said Thursday that its profit doubled in the first three months of the year.The Charlotte, N.C.-based lender posted earnings of $8.05 billion in the first quarter. That compared with $4.01 billion a year earlier, when banks took big hits to their earnings to begin stockpiling rainy-day reserves at the beginning of the pandemic.The bank made 86 cents a share, beating the 66 cents forecast in a FactSet poll of analysts.Earnings from the largest banks have reflected heightened optimism about an economic rebound. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. said Wednesday they both released money they had socked away last year to cover widespread loan defaults.Bank of America said it released $2.7 billion of its reserves, boosting its bottom line. Charge-offs were down from a year earlier.Like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America also benefited from a crazy quarter on Wall Street. Higher trading revenue and investment banking fees helped power earnings.Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan has long expressed optimism about the economy, saying consumer spending is picking back up.""We believe that progress in the health crisis and the economy point to an accelerating recovery,"" Mr. Moynihan said in a statement.The bank now expects U.S. gross domestic product to return to pre-pandemic levels by the third quarter of this year, Paul Donofrio, chief financial officer, said on a call with reporters. A few months ago, the expectation was that GDP wouldn't return to those levels until 2022. Such forecasts help determine how much the lender sets aside for bad loans.But America's second largest bank is still managing through the crisis, which ushered in record low rates. That has eroded the spread between what banks pay to borrow and what they earn from lending. Net interest income totaled $10.2 billion in the first quarter, down 16% from $12.13 billion a year earlier.Like other banks, the lender's book of loans continued to shrink, reflecting soft demand from consumers and businesses. Outstanding loans and leases also dropped by 14% to $903.01 billion.Noninterest income rose 19% to $12.62 billion, from $10.64 billion a year earlier, helped by fees in its capital-markets businesses.Adjusted trading revenue rose 17% to $5.08 billion from $4.34 billion a year earlier. By comparison, trading revenue rose 47% at Goldman and 25% and JPMorgan.A boom in mergers and stock offerings boosted investment-banking divisions, particularly those working with special-purpose acquisition companies. Bank of America also benefited, led by equity issuance. Investment banking fees rose 62% to $2.25 billion, from $1.39 billion a year earlier.Altogether, the bank's revenue was flat at $22.82 billion, from $22.77 billion a year ago. Still, that beat the $21.9 billion analysts had forecast.The bank separately said its board approved a $25 billion share buyback plan. The Federal Reserve has said its restrictions on shareholder returns will expire at the end of June.Bank of America shares rose in premarket trading Thursday. Bank stocks have been hot this year, rising more than the broader market after falling sharply when the coronavirus hit the U.S. last year.The bank's expenses jumped 15% in the first quarter to $15.52 billion, from $13.48 billion a year ago. Bank of America noted some one-time expenses, including about $300 million from incentive compensation changes and $160 million in severance.A boom in mergers and stock offerings boosted banks' investment-banking divisions, particularly those working on special-purpose acquisition companies. Bank of America also benefited, led by equity issuance.

2809,"07/30 - 11:52:00ET - A common conversation among investors these days is whether they should sell their stocks and move to cash, or hedge against a potential decline.So many people have made so much money in such an unusual time that the market resembles an ATM. Put a dollar in today, and in a minute, hour, week, or month, it magically grows into something more. Yet the real world is odder and odder.In major U.S. cities, people with different political views dress up like Rambo, arm themselves as if they are headed to war, and face off against each other as even more heavily-armed federal agents emerge from the sidelines to maintain the peace, however that may be defined.Meanwhile, the U.S. has been hobbled by the coronavirus, and the federal government is again about to flood the economy with trillions of dollars to prevent economic and financial catastrophe. And for that, the stock market continues to be carried higher by a handful of stocks, including Alphabet (ticker: GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and other tech names.Strategists who were helping investors find stocks to profit off Covid-19- triggered changes in working and living are now increasingly dealing with clients wanting to hedge their portfolios. Yet everyone is discovering that hedging is expensive, perhaps too costly if the stock market fails to lose 25% or more of its value.As this hedging conversation occurs, one of the world's most admired investors has finally revealed what's on his mind. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) bought $1.2 billion of Bank of America (BAC) stock from July 20 through July 27 , paying an average price of $24 a share.Berkshire now holds 998 million BofA shares worth $25 billion , making it Berkshire's second-largest equity holding behind Apple .Buffett's decision to buy a weak stock is noteworthy when so many others are talking about hedging. In fact, it's hard to recall a time when Buffett has not chosen to make major purchases when the market was weak.Buffett's actions reinforce the notion that it is arguably better to buy fear than to hedge fear. Aside from the expense of hedging, which can depress portfolio returns, hedgers have to be right on the timing. The more time packed into the hedge, the more expensive the hedge.While it sounds catchy to describe the stock market as having become "" antifragile"" -- able to withstand social and financial chaos -- it's truly difficult to have such confidence about something as diverse and complicated. Instead, it's better to focus on stocks, which are more knowable.In that spirit, let's reconsider Bank of America , a company we have championed since the darkest days of the financial crisis, well before Buffett became its most famous shareholder. When it seemed as if the bank might go under, we championed it and CEO Brian Moynihan , and encouraged investors to build positions when the stock was trading close to zero.Now, after more than a decade, Bank of America is in a very different place, though the shares are again weak as the Federal Reserve once more reduces rates to support a wounded economy and financial system.With the stock at $24.71 , investors could sell BofA's September $25 put option for $1.31 .So far this year, Bank of America's stock is down 30%. Over the past year, the stock is down 18%. During the past 52 weeks, the stock has ranged from $ 17.95 to $35.72 .If the stock is below the strike price at expiration, investors buy the stock. Should the stock be above the strike price at expiration, investors keep the put premium. The key risk is the stock falling far below the strike price, obligating investors to buy shares at the higher strike price. Even if the stock falls below the strike price, don't fret. Remember what Buffett does: He uses weakness to his long-term advantage.",0.9842

I am thinking of waiting a bit more while the market does it's thing and perhaps jump in and get some shares at high 30s or low 40s .The stock has a lot of volume and while collecting dividends, I was thinking of selling covered calls to keep earning extra weekly premiums. I own TD bank but options on that bank is not the best and I am not about the ""chasing"" hype stocks, I rather make a decent weekly income while the stock appreciates in value.

All dividend from a C corp to a C corp receive a dividend receive deduction of 50% to avoid triple taxation (or $360 million). Once ownership exceeds 20% the DRD (Dividend Receive Deduction) goes up to 65%. Say Berkshire bought out the 3 for a total of approx 2.5 billion shares. Dividends on 2.5 billion would be $1.8 billion (Most likely it will increase from here out). BUT now Berkshire owns over 20% of BAC and is now allowed a 65% DRD so the $1.8 billion in dividends would only subject 35% ($630 million) to taxation. So dividends increase to $1.8 billion from $720 or an increase of $1.080 billion and you pay taxes on $630 instead of $360 million or an additional tax on $270 million. WOW",0.9788

But my average is around $15 per share. So you do the math - horrible return on investment for 7 years including pathetic dividends. So I am thinking - we'll see where we are after elections etc - maybe even until stress tests next year. But after that - if this hasn't moved up over $20 per share and 40 - 50 cents per year in dividends (which will require some rate hikes, etc) , going to dump it all.
