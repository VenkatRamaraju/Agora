25,"Don't let them fool you into selling. At $13.2 NOV is the *only* oil stock that has a potential to double within the next 12 months, even if oil prices just remain at current levels ~$60. It is dirt cheap and there is large pent up demand for its products/services, which will materialize later in the year. Mark my words: NOV @26 in a year, if oil just remains around $60. None of the other stocks that I follow will double, even those that I highly recommended in the past. For example, HP and SLB will not be at $54, HFC will not be at $70, BP will not be at $49. The only other stocks with a double potential is PBF but that is a very high risk/reward stock, unlike NOV which has a strong balance sheet and generated $700 million in FCF last year, despite the worse year for the oil industry.

43,"I think the new tax law impacted NOV's first quarter. The new tax law allows immediate expensing of capital equipment purchases, effective January 1st. If companies were thinking about ordering equipment from NOV in November or December, they obviouslywould have held off to see if they would have gotten a way bigger tax deal in 2018, and they did.So, if orders from November/December were pushed to January/February, NOV wouldn't have had enoughtime to build that equipment and book it as revenue in Q1. I also think those delays will just add to pent-up demand and compound the orders into 2018. Indeed, NOV's CEO characterized the dearth of revenue as a temporary thing, consistent with what I'msuggesting.",0.5823

49,"This sort of revenue pre-announcement is always rough and comes on the heels of a not so good previous quarter.To my way of thinking, NOV is famous for being ultra-informative. The revenue miss is bad but it is likely that people are more upset about the ""Opaque"" statement - The truth sucks but it isn't the end of the world.Perhaps a mistake, but I am staying long; this money may be locked up for a while, but this does not seem to be a case of NOV losing to an emerging competitor.If I owned BHGE (which has held up this morning), I would be selling them right @#$^* now.

If the board of directors cannot act quickly on this, then we need to replace the board of directors. It's that simple. this used to be a viable company, but not anymore. With facility consolidation and a 20% headcount reduction, we can bring the cost structure back in line and return this company to meaningful profitability.
