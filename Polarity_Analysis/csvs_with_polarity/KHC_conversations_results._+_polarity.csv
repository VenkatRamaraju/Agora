204,"While Kraft still faces headwinds, the company still appears to be an attractive security, especially in the highly valued market we have today. Kraft is trading 27.5% under its book value, which is reflective of the $15.4 billion in write-downs. Furthermore, Kraft has lost significantly more market value than it has total revenue stream. It's worth noting that a solid portion of Kraft's revenue declines were due to currency weaknesses and negative pricing. However, currency weaknesses are quite variable, and Kraft has already stated that its new pricing strategy has turned pricing positive. Furthermore, Kraft is producing free cash flow figures that are near the company's all-time highs. Kraft cut its dividend by more than a third and still offers a dividend yield of 5.28%, which is more than sustainable with Kraft's cash flows. While Kraft may still have its work cut out for it, its shares are worth a strong consideration at current market prices.",0.9745

We’re off to a good start, but there is still much work to be done.” (Source: Ibid.)If you want to take advantage of this growth story, this is probably the right time to buy Kraft Heinz stock. Rumors are rife that the company may be preparing to acquire another food giant after consolidating its balance sheet. The name which is making rounds in the press is Mondelez International Inc (NASDAQ:MDLZ), the maker of “Oreos” and “Triscuits” brands.

Reactions Reblog on Tumblr Share Tweet Email - By Praveen ChawlaOn Thursday Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC) blind-sided investors with a carton of rotten eggs when it closed its books for 2018.The company faced a bad earnings report (expected by many as the company had been struggling with lack of growth for some time), a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into its accounting practices that resulted in a $25 million charge and a monster write-down of intangible goodwill that resulted in a $15.4 billion charge. Its book value per share was slashed from $54.70 in 2017 to $42.45, and it cut its dividend by 36% from $2.50 a share to $1.60. The new dividend yield as of Friday is 4.6%.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Signs with KHC. Click here to check it out. KHC 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of KHCPeter Lynch Chart of KHCThe stock, which hit a high of $90 two years ago, plunged 27% Friday, the day of the report, closing at $34.95. This plunge has been a humiliating comedown for the great Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital, who midwifed the merger between Kraft and Heinz to create Kraft Heinz, which was supposed to consolidate the food industry. In fact, only a year ago, Kraft Heinz tried but failed to acquire Unilever (UL) towards that goal. Berkshire owns about 26% of the common shares and 3G owns about 22%. 3G's modus operandi is ruthless cost cutting using a management tool called zero-based budgeting.The media narrative is that too much value was extracted from the Kraft Heinz brands through cost cutting, which impacted growth and innovation while at the same time consumer tastes were shifting against conventional packaged foods towards more healthy choices. While I do not know the internal machinations that drove the rather sudden recognition of the goodwill impairment, my guess is that this may have been through the intervention of the external auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers. In any event this appears to be kitchen-sink quarter, with management taking its lumps all together and putting a brave face forward.The reaction among shell-shocked investors, financial media and the blogosphere has been savage. Many small investors who followed Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) into Kraft-Heinz vented frustration and bitterness on the internet forums and blogs. They lost their trust in management and fear that more cockroaches are coming.But lost in the clouds of crying, lamentations and angry finger pointing are two silver lines. First, the company has reported a modest increase in net sales from $26.259 billion to $26.085 billion - a minuscule move in the right direction.Second, the company's operating cash flow (ignoring non-cash impairments and non-cash tax adjustments from last year) is still $3.86 per share (see note below) compared to around $5.37 to last year. The non-cash impairment, while unfortunate, is driven by accounting assumptions of growth and discount rates and is largely an adjustment of already sunk cost. It's at best a belated recognition that the company paid too much to buy the said asset originally, and the market conditions do not warrant that valuation.Goodwill for brands is such a fuzzy and intangible concept that I do not find it meaningful for valuation purposes. Operating cash is much more real for valuation, and right now and Kraft Heinz sells for around nine times each dollar of operating cash flow. Nestle, for example, sells for around 18 times operating cash flow, Unilever is at 18, General Mills at 10 and Campbell Soup at 7. Hopefully, Kraft Heinz will improve its numbers from their current depressed state. The 4.6% dividend is all not too shabby.Figure 1-From Kraft-Heinz fourth-quarter 2018 investor presentationMy adjustments to get to 2018 operating cash flow estimate:Millions except per share amount 2018 Net Loss -10,229 add Non-cash impairments 15,939 Subtract income taxes -1,006 Operating cash flow 4,704 divide by Diluted share count 1219 Operating cash flow per diluted share $3.86 Disclosure: I am long Kraft Heinz and am currently underwater.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.Warning!

394,Any move lower in KHC should now be purchased or call options way deep in the money . If you do deep in the money calls make sure you are paying almost the same price as the stock.

Build that big position and work it to lower your input cost so you have the lowest input cost paying the higher % dividend you can on your shares. You must now take full advantage of the Wall Street AI computer when the Wall Street crooks use the AI computers and way over sell stocks and you must also take full advantage of the Wall Streets crooks when they use the AI computers to drive your stock to high.

My 2nd thought is this company has a lot of debt, but it's coverage ratio appears to be 5.5/1 - roughly 6B in profit per 1B in interest expense. That doesn't scare me too much. Lastly, one of the negatives is it appears to have a ton of intangible net worth, and as we've seen, this is not dependable or accurate.

I’d like to discuss something more meaningful than bashing Buffet and consumer goods, like most posts on here.First, I am long here as well, with an average price of $55, yes back in October or so, I thought I was getting a deal considering this had traded at 80-90 less than a year prior and all the news was that it was tunrmjng itself around. With such a huge brand name, a Buffet stock, a 4.5% yield at the time, and the fact that a quarter of the grocery store space is KHC products, I thought I was ‘safe’ in the turbulent correction at the end of 2018. I read a ton of negative posts, nothing positive really, even comparisons to GE, which are still bogus. However a possible scenario keeps coming back to mind. This is already half owned by Berkshire and 3G, has anyone considered a takeover for the other half? If so, figuring out a premium or right price would murder any longs on here, since I am most certain many have bought at even higher prices than I have. I understand 2019 will be a 0 growth year here, somehwat complemented by a lowered dividend with the only positive being deleveraging. The thought of a buyout at these prices tho, terrifies me, as it would be substantially under purchase price. Thoughts? Let’s keep bashing off.",0.9869

1279,"i dont know what to make of Gareth Soloway..... investing d0t c0m says:Shares of Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) have been in a spiral lower since 2017. The stock topped out near $100 in January 2017 and has fallen almost non-stop. While the chart is nasty, there are signs of life as traders start to accumulate. First, KHC now pays a 5% dividend yield. With the 10-year yield trading below 2.50%, this makes for an attractive place to park money. Next, Buffet owns a large stake and he rarely loses.Technically OversoldAnother big factor is the oversold metrics. Almost every technical signal shows an oversold condition with positive divergences starting to appear. This speaks of a coming up move for the stock. Finally, investor sentiment is as bearish as ever on Kraft Heinz. When investors expect the absolute worst, it does not take much for the company to showcase some light at the end of the tunnel and see a short-covering pop in the stock. With earnings due, signals point to an up-move ahead. Calculations show a possible upside target of $41 from its current $32 price.",0.9167

1474,"W@W Very Negative Comments Out Today (Strong Sell)OutlookManagement expects to continue with organic sales growth in 2019, on the back of additional consumption gains stemming from improved volume/mix. This, in turn, is expected to be fueled by innovation, whitespace and distribution endeavors, and pricing activities. These are likely to help Kraft Heinz battle cost-related worries.However, organic sales are anticipated to decline in the first quarter due to unfavorable year-over-year comparisons. Further, currency headwinds and divestitures are expected to hurt net sales by 3-4% in 2019.In terms of profitability, management expects adjusted EBITDA to decline at a high-teens rate in the first quarter, owing to cost inflation and planned commercial expenditure. Although the company in undertaking solid pricing initiatives, these are not likely to yield until the end of the first quarter. Moreover, management expects the bottom line to witness impressive growth from 2020.In 2019, earnings are likely to remain pressurized by soft EBITDA, increased depreciation costs and elevated interest costs, among other factors. Though the company remains conservative about 2019, it is on track to deliver consistent rise in profits from 2020 on the back of improved cost structures, brand strength and enhanced capacities.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. The consensus estimate has shifted -26.26% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Kraft has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

The company's BBB rating is two rungs above investment grade. The move comes after Kraft Heinz failed to file its 2018 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission by its due date, which was extended to March 14 at the end of February. It also follows ""a series of negative developments over the last several quarters, including operational shortfalls that accelerated in the second half of 2018, the large fourth-quarter $15.4 billion goodwill and intangible charge-off, and disclosure of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation into the company's accounting policies, procedures, and internal controls related to its procurement function,"" S&P said in a release. The ratings agency expects to resolve the issue following a review of the 10-K and first quarter of 2019. ""It is likely that a downgrade would be limited to one notch, unless particularly negative information is uncovered,"" said the release. Shares were slightly lower premarket, but have fallen 50.9% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 has gained 2.6%.-Ciara Linnane",-0.7016

It's that simple.Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) didn't divest its holding of Kraft Heinz (KHC), so picking up the stock at this bargain basement price now makes total sense. My first article on the holding wasn't well received, garnering 2.6 star rating. At the time, I was asking the question ""Is Kraft Heinz Buffett's Biggest Mistake?"" last summer. At the time the stock was just below $60 a share. Now it's at $35. • Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Signs with KHC. Click here to check it out. • KHC 15-Year Financial Data • The intrinsic value of KHC • Peter Lynch Chart of KHCHowever, now that the market has acted irrationally, sending the stock price down 28% in a day, the multiples look more in line with slow-growth blue-chip companies. And, the dividend yield is super juicy! Finally, it's a buy. And, all these downgrades just further the idea that it's a bargain. Investment analysts are usually the last people to hop on or off the bagwagon. This time it's no different and with the stock trading below $35 (pre-market), Buffett himself should be buying more down here.￼Buffett even admitted to overpaying for the stock, a mistake that he should not be making on a company like this, but Mr. Market gets us all. Buffett told CNBC, ""I was wrong in a couple of ways about Kraft Heinz. We overpaid for Kraft."" And, ""It's still a wonderful business in that it uses about $7 billion of tangible assets and earns $6 billion pretax."" But, ""we paid $100 billion in tangible assets. So for us, it has to earn $107 billion, not just the $7 billion that the business employs."" More importantly, Berkshire is not selling or lowering its stake in the company. What more vote of confidence do you need that the stock is on sale?Aside from the 7.15% dividend yield, thanks to the 27% sell-off, the stock is now priced at less than book value and below 10x forward earnings. Is Kraft Heinz going out of business in 10 years? What about 20? Highly unlikely. That's all investors need to know at this point. While we may not have a bear market, this is a bear price for an incredible company. Take advantage while you can.Disclosure: I am not long or short Kraft-Heinz.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.",0.996

Great -- that implies a return on assets of 60%+ or greater.That's all very fine and dandy, but are we to completely ignore the rest of the balance sheet?Goodwill of $36Bn for example or:-Intangibles of $49BnWell given the pain of last years write downs, clearly you can't just brush these under the carpet.The real ROCE (return on capital employed) is EBIT (or operating income) / (Total Assets - Current Liabilities), which on a quick #$%$ packet calculation = $4.96bn/($103.46Bn-$7.5Bn) = 5.2%So the real return is 5.2%.I believe there is recovery potential in the share price here, and it has some momentum right now with Covid, but as a long term investment, do you choose a company with a ROCE of 5.2% or one at 25%+ for which there are a plethora of them in the US market today?I'm holding out for the recovery, but long term is the dividend sufficient to retain interest if the business can only return 5.2% which is close to what is being paid out?Shoot me if I've got something wrong here guys.Larry -- From over in Blighty across the pond.",0.9914

Since then however, Mondelez has gained 21%, while Kraft has plunged 46%.On the surface, both of these companies appear identical. They sell similar products into the same markets and have similar costs. Both companies also make acquisitions to grow and then cut costs to improve their bottom lines. The difference however, is in the execution.Cramer said Kraft uses a mallet when it cuts costs, but Mondelez cuts with a scalpel and uses surgical precision. So while Mondelez has seen its sales stay essentially flat as it divests businesses to move into more lucrative ones, Kraft has been forced to take write downs and slash its dividend.Cramer was still a fan of Mondelez, but told investors to steer clear of Kraft Heinz.",0.9041

And yet here we are, back to 30 a share. Why does it seem that no one really believes in this company. And why are they so slow with turning things around. For example, there is NO REASON they could not have developed a true Beyond Meat competitor in the past year. Even Trader Joe's came out with their own branded protein plant patties this week.

While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future.

We suspect the reason may have to do with matters related to the SEC investigation into KHC's procurement practices, which has so far led to a $25M adjustment to increase cost of products sold. KHC did provide further information related to the $15.4B write-down to goodwill ($7.1B) and intangible assets ($8.3B). The goodwill write-down was related to five reporting units, most notably a $4.3B write-down in the U.S. Refrigerated unit. The intangible asset write-down was related to five brands, most notably Kraft (with a $4.1B write-down) and Oscar Meyer (with a $3.3B write-down). One key takeaway is that the U.S. Grocery reporting unit with $18.5B of goodwill currently has a fair value excess less than 10% of carrying value, leading us to think there could be additional material write-downs in the future.

That, combined with many eateries reverting to take-out only orders where packets would be included, has resulted in a shortage at chains according to WSJ. To combat the shortage, Heinz — which is America's most widely used ketchup brand — plans to increase single-serve packet production by about 25% to produce over 12 billion packets per year.

2822,"M2 money supply moved to the right. Economic output remains stable (or more likely suppressed) this equates to increased prices. KHC input costs likely stable or falling due to weak demand in supplier’s market (agriculture demand weak due to less restaurant consumption). KHC products are predominately price inelastic therefore higher prices shouldn’t impact demand. Beneficiaries of increased grocery foot traffic as consumers forgo restaurants (out of fear, shut down, or lost of wages). Consumer staple demand increasing as work from home orders persist. Now, it’s all about management execution... KHC is experiencing strong secular tailwinds and is poised to breakout if they’re capitalizing on current market conditions. It will come down to execution and managements ability to pass prices through distribution (could be tough as channels also are attempting to expand margins)... My analysis suggest it’s a strong buy as I see both channels and manufacturers poised to benefit from strong secular tailwinds.",0.9124

KHC is in a unique position to be one of the heroes of this pandemic: Keeping factory's running around the clock so our grocery's and supermarkets stay full...setting up food banks in parking lots...helping those less fortunate in the coming weeks with care packages...and reminding Americans that Kraft Heinz is ONE OF US. We are an an American company, born n'bred in the USA (or should we say ""born 'n bread.) So yes - THIS is the time for a PR BLITZ.

And we are on the front lines fighting right along side viewers. And we are in it to win it.So wake up Mr. PR dude...get a clue Mrs. Marketing Manager. Step up, get proactive, and start connecting with the American people again. Create some corporate responsibility programs. Reintroduce yourself to our country. Help them get to know who Kraft is and what they stand for...give them the opportunity to make see Kraft with fresh eyes...in a whole new light.

We're having volumes, consumption and market share gains in the vast majority of our categories. Even categories that have been declining for quite some time are seeing a momentum, right? And we do know there is more to come. Not only that, even with the miss of the fourth quarter, we continue to operate at industry-leading margins, and we think the 2019 base that David just highlight is a base we can grow sales and EBITDA going forward. With the actions we're taking on dividend and the work we're doing in portfolio, it remains to be successful and we are confident we can be. We will have a balance sheet that's more flexible and more prepared for future consolidation. So in that sense, I think the commercial momentum is happening. In that sense, I think even with the miss in U.S. operations, we still have the base of the margin here that allows us from this base to build 2020 and beyond and the balance sheet flexibility for future consolidation for us to be a consolidator if the industry goes our way.",0.9892

KHC guides for flat to positive organic sales growth in 2021 and low-single digit adj-EBITDA growth (ex-FX). KHC also agreed to sell its Nuts business to Hormel Foods for $3.35B, its second major sale announcement over the past year (also will sell the Natural Cheese business for $3.2B). These divestitures are in line with KHC's transformation plan outlined last year and should allow KHC to pay down debt and invest in other high-growth areas. We keep our Buy as there should be upside to EPS as the turnaround strategy is executed.",0.9851

With that being said very few markets have catalysts. I have owned KHC and cut my losses at 60. Played a for a few swings since that were short and sweet.You want something that is further along in the cycle then check out frac sand. The dirty little secret is frac said completed its downturn of a cycle this quarter as they had theirs with oil the last few years and sand specific issues last year and earlier this year.Drillers have stopped drilling!!! But this is actually good news. Because there are more DUC wells than ever. Wells that are drilled but not completed. From here on out they will be taking capital for drilling and reallocating to completions which require the frac sand. My favorite names are sand plays $cvia, $hcr and then these guys who actually do the pumping and completing of the well, $ftsi.The beauty is the stocks are so cheap that management is buying back shares. That is how you do buybacks!!! Spend it when you can buy the shares cheap. Not like the fake companies out there borrowing to buy back shares at all-time highs.

3535,"Kraft Heinz Stock Is Sliding on the Latest Bad News -- Barrons.com10:07 am ET March 18, 2019 (Dow Jones) PrintBy Teresa RivasKraft Heinz stock (ticker: KHC) is drifting lower again on Monday, following news that its 10-K filling will be delayed.The Back Story. Plenty of consumer-staples stocks suffered in 2018, and Kraft was one of the hardest hit, tumbling in November on disappointing third-quarter earnings, a poster child for the argument that safe stocks that don't look so safe anymore. However, Kraft went from a lagging staple to a much more worrisome story in February, when it reported fourth-quarter results. Not only did those -- and its guidance -- disappoint, Kraft also slashed the dividend, logged a $15.4 billion asset write-down related to its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands, and disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission has been investigating its procurement division's accounting practices since October 2018.Not surprisingly, a number of analysts downgraded the stock over the weeks that followed, and Kraft is down 49.5% in the trailing 12 month period. It's off nearly 26% since the start of the year, with even Warren Buffett admitting he was wrong on the stock.What's New. Late Friday, Kraft said that it wouldn't be able to meet the deadline to file its 10-K with the SEC. It now has 60 days to file an action plan for the document, and the company expects to do so in the coming weeks.The news is not exactly surprising, given all the moving parts that Kraft warned of last month, including the investigation that the agency is pursuing. Yet it's enough to push the shares down again Monday.Looking Ahead. Back in November 2017, Barron's warned that staples softness would persist, a thesis that's held true for Kraft -- and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLP), which is up just under 8% year to date, trailing the market. As we noted when news first broke, Kraft was already one of the weaker-performing packaged food companies, as it was struggling to show organic sales growth without deep discounts, and was saddled with a high debt load from private equity deals concerning its predecessor companies. It was also troubling that the company chose not to disclose the SEC investigation during its earnings in November, even though it already knew about the agency's concerns. Today's news is serious, it's the latest in a long line of bad headlines for Kraft stock, which doesn't look like a bargain, yet.W@W !",0.8434

If you purchased or otherwise acquired Kraft Heinz securities between May 4, 2017 and February 21, 2019 (the ""class period"") and suffered losses contact Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP. For more information visit:https://www.hbsslaw.com/cases/KHCor contact Reed Kathrein, who is leading the firm's investigation, by calling 510-725-3000 or emailingKHC@hbsslaw.com.According to the complaint, during the class period Defendants misled investors about Kraft's internal controls over financial reporting and its carrying values of goodwill and certain intangible assets.On February 21, 2019, Defendants announced Kraft's carrying values of certain goodwill and intangible assets were well below their carrying amounts. More specifically Kraft recorded impairment charges of $15.4 billion to lower the carrying amount of (a) goodwill, primarily in the U.S. Refrigerated and Canada Retail reporting units, and (b) intangible assets, primarily the Kraft and Oscar Mayer trademarks.In addition, Defendants announced Kraft received a subpoena in October 2018 from the SEC associated with ""an investigation into the Company's procurement area, more specifically the Company's accounting policies, procedures, and internal controls related to its procurement function, including, but not limited to, agreements, side agreements, and changes or modifications to its agreements with its vendors.""This news drove the price of Kraft shares down $13.23, or down about 27.5%, to close at $34.95 on February 22, 2019.""We're focused on investors' losses, the extent to which Defendants' statements about impairment analysis and asset values may have misled investors, and possibly improper use of side agreements,"" said Hagens Berman partner Reed Kathrein.Whistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding Kraft Heinz should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC.

Heinz to about 52.5 percent as billionaire Warren Buffett exercised a warrant in the ketchup maker ahead of its planned merger with Kraft Foods Group Inc.Buffett was able to add a 5.4 percent stake in Heinz for 1 cent a share under terms of the 2013 deal when Berkshire and 3G Capital took the food company private. He purchased 46.2 million shares for about $462,000, Pittsburgh-based Heinz said in a regulatory filing Thursday.Berkshire previously controlled about half the common stock, and also has preferred stake of $8 billion that pays an annual dividend of $720 million. While Buffett is on the board of Heinz, the company is managed by Jorge Paulo Lemann’s 3G, which has been slashing jobs. Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire and 3G have agreed to combine with Kraft, where Lemann’s company has said it plans more cost cuts.“Efficiency is required over time in capitalism,” Buffett, 84, said at Berkshire’s annual meeting in May. “I really tip my hat to what the 3G people have done”",0.9912

Today after a wash-out sell off $CVIA ran and ran and ran. Go do your own DD. But from technical perspective we had a huge daily engulfing candle. There have only been two. One was last month. On balance volume peaked (negatively) in June meaning accumulation has been happening.The sum of the parts of this company was easily worth 4-5 billion based on recent asset sales. One plant sold for 135 million and 100 miles of rail sold for 100 million. They have 40’more plants and more rails.

Additionally, the Company is in the process of implementing certain improvements to its internal controls to mitigate the likelihood of this occurring in the future and has taken other remedial measures.

MOMENTS AGO 12:26 PM EST $27 Price Target !This Analyst Thinks It Could Get Worse For Kraft Heinz12:26 pm ET March 29, 2019 (Benzinga) PrintInvestors assuming Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ: KHC)'s business can't get any worse are likely wrong, according to Wolfe Research.The AnalystWolfe Research's Scott Mushkin downgraded Kraft Heinz from Peer Perform to Underperform with a fair value price target lowered from $33 to $27.The ThesisKraft's management indicated during its fourth-quarter conference call it will be increasing prices by the end of March, Mushkin said in a note. The research firm's first-hand checks found only three brands cost more (Jell-O, Kool-Aid and Velveeta) on a year-over-year basis. Meanwhile, other brands including Heinz Ketchup actually saw a price decrease.Overall, a basket of 17 different Kraft items cost 2.6 percent less today than it did last year at retail giant Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT).It's possible Kraft oversaw a price increase at some of Walmart's competitors, but Mushkin said it's ""difficult to retain if they are not accepted by Walmart.""Kraft Heinz boasts among the best EBITDA margin rates in the industry, but multiple factors aside from the absence of price increases could see its financial profile worsen in the near term, Mushkin said.",0.9275
