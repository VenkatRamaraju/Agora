463,"Shorts like to lean on the lofty PE ratio as a reason to bet against this name. They don't take into account that this company is turning a profit and is net income positive, their gross profit margins are greater than 85 percent, their debt is low and they have infinitely more net cash than they have debt. And finally, they are free cash flow positive and the free cash flow is 3 times the debt. Bottom line, they can pay down all their debt and still have plenty of cash left over. And finally, they have a competitive advantage in the way their software is revolutionizing the workplace. These are cheap prices compared to where it has traded. I predict 500 and above are in the company's future. There is very little to dislike here.",0.9541
