Only if all vehicles were under the same computer control, would it be efficient.Cabbies are cheap labor and smart drivers. They take calculated risks to achieve speed including violating traffic laws were appropriate. This is frequently necessary in high traffic urban settings.

73,"I just must respond to FLAFA who keeps mindlessly posting Tesla's PR talking points:1. Tesla - 12 startup companies in one. Blah, blah, blah.. every car company has multiple revenue streams - car sales, service, warranties, financing, partnerships, parts, paints, etc. BMW makes everything from boats to wheelchairs. Honda makes motorcycles and jets. Hyundai makes trains, ships and subway cars. The list goes on. Tesla is not somehow unique for being a production ""conglomerate"".2. Tesla is in the energy market.... blah, blah, blah... so are 100 other companies, producing everything from dams, wind, solar, solar panels, roofs, batteries, oil, gas, blah, blah, blah. Highly competitive market.3. Solar roof not just panels. blah, blah, blah... .VERY EXPENSIVE... VERY, VERY, VERY expensive. Solar panels are cheaper to install, easier to replace and much, much cheaper to insure.4. Tesla home HVAC. blah, blah, blah... no shortage of HVAC companies whose solutions can plug right into conventional or renewable energy source. 5. Robotaxi - a concept at this time at most. We can't even seriously talk about this unti Telsa's on FSD stop crashing into stop vehicles at high speed.6. FSD. A $11,000+ option that even most Tesla car buyers can't afford. The subscription service is just the ""$1 bargin bin"" to find another way to sell something most buyers can't afford. On top of all that, again - it keeps crashing into things. Still a long way to go on this.7. 4 modern giga factories with more to come. This is actually Tesla's disadvantage - lack of manufacturing facilities. GM, VW, Toyota and other companies have way more facilities. As far as ""more to come"" - Tesla has the money but chose to put it into bitcoin rather than more gigafactories... so apparently at this time there is no need for more gigafactories.8. Multi year product road-map. Every successful company has 9. Best engineering work force in the world. Meh - totally subjective.10. Projected 50% growth for forseeable future. blah, blah, blah... maybe - but that is already priced into the stock.11. Profitable last 5 quarters. HA - only because of carbon credits and bitcoin.12. Strong product roadmap. This is just another way of saying they don't currently have an affordable car, or a truck. Personally I think an affordable sedan should have been placed before the semi and roadster. 13. Laser focused. Really?? I'll say that again, really??? Flamethrowers, bitcoin, hover jets for the roadster... a semi that is years behind schedule?14. Yes, Musk is a genius and a motivated, clever business person. Yes, Tesla is a good company with great products. But it's just blah, blah, blah to parrot back their talking points - all of which are currently why the company has an insane PE ratio. Everything, including the kitchen sink are priced in. Now it is time for Tesla to PERFORM - to make money on real products, not just carbon credits. Blah, blah, blah...",0.9986

Tesla shares closed Thursday at $661.75 (markets were closed Friday).Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives also changed his rating from hold to outperform. “In our opinion the 1Q delivery numbers released on Friday was a paradigm changer,” he said in a note. New Stocks to Buy Now SEE IT ❯❯ Top 3 Stocks to Buy SEE IT ❯❯ Stocks Set to Double SEE IT ❯❯ Buffett Stocks to Buy SEE IT ❯❯ Ad| LocalOn Friday, Tesla reported first-quarter deliveries, its proxy for sales, totaling 184,800 vehicles, blowing past the FactSet consensus of 168,000. The Silicon Valley electric-vehicle maker said it produced just over 180,000 vehicles in the period in what Ives called a “drop the mic” number.“We now believe Tesla could exceed 850k deliveries for the year with 900k a stretch goal, despite the chip shortage and various supply chain issues lingering across the auto sector,” Ives said Sunday. He added “eye popping delivery numbers coming out of China cannot be ignored with the trajectory on pace to represent ~40% of deliveries for Musk & Co. by 2022.”Ives and his team also see Tesla’s profitability significantly improving over the next three to four years.Tesla shares are down 6.2% year to date, but have skyrocketed 628% over the past 12 months.",0.9786

Johnson highlighted the fact that the automaker was “barely” producing any cars in China in Q1 2020 and price cuts of approximately $8,500 for Model 3 Standard Range and $24,100 for Model Y Long Range had not yet been made.“More specifically, the ONLY quarter where TSLA had fully cut the prices for its cars in China and had full production in China was 4Q20, where the company sold 180.6K cars; so, the ONLY thing that matters for TSLA in 1Q21, and going forward, in our view, is sequential growth,” wrote Johnson.As per the analyst, the growing volumes of 2% in Q1 on a quarter-over-quarter basis “is not a good thing.”Johnson said that Tesla’s growth prospects in large car markets around the world have peaked out and there is “no more low-hanging fruit.”“This is not a company with a production problem; this is a company with a DEMAND PROBLEM,” wrote Johnson.",0.9541

Tesla doesn't officially give these numbers, but it surprises me that TSLA sold nearly 200k vehicles in the US in 2018 and sales declined in the US in 2019 (slightly).Musk is like a magician. He is a master of distracting one's attention from what is actually happening. So, in Fall of 2019 we had battery day and Musk was promising 1 million Robo taxis in the US in 2020. What he wasn't talking about was the decline in US vehicles sales by Tesla.Now, 2020, US sales were nearly 300k (it seems, again TSLA doesn't disclose official numbers).So, if TSLA is a super growth company, what's in store for 2021 in US sales? About 450k? Maybe, but, monthly sales figures have been in the low 20's so far (and the first quarter is at a record sales pace of all US auto sales in 2021). In other words, TSLA, so far, is lagging BEHIND it's 2020 sales pace in the US.

426,"Suppose FSD is here and it works!What does that mean for TSLA profits??Could TSLA get an extra $1k per car of revenue (on average per vehicle sold annually)? Maybe. But over time, competition will drive down the premium over whatever extra cost is involved installing the extra cameras.But $10k is simply a fantasy of Bulls. It's not really that useful, even if it works (more or less). Some might pay that much in spending $100k on a model X, but, few model 3 drivers would. Many people would rather drive a car rather than watch the car being driving. Will one, for example, be able to drive to one's local bar Saturday night, drink alcohol to raise blood alcohol levels above the legal limit and use self drive to get home safely and free from any drunk driving charge if pulled over by the police? Hardly, absent some changes in the law. This might happen eventually, but, TSLA's lead in developing FSD (if it has one) will be lost by the time legislatures act.Robo taxis are out for the very same reason. It just isn't legal to have a car on the road without a driver.This too might change in time, but, probably only after any lead TSLA had vanishes.One can see TSLA's move into auto insurance as not so much a way to obtain profits from a new line of business, but a necessity for TSLA owners if auto insurers don't want to take on the risk of insuring Tesla under FSD. Actually, I suspect one the negatives of a Tesla currently may be auto insurance premiums higher than for more conventional cars.",0.9898
427,"Elon Musk was recently quoted as saying the following: “When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world, and probably, next year. So I am not 100% certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely. I’d say more likely than not that in 2022 Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.” Given that Ford sells over 1M F-150s per year and Toyota sells over 1.1M Corollas per year, and Tesla has only estimated sales of 750K total vehicles for 2021...what exactly is Musk saying? Is he actually saying Tesla plans to sell over a million Model Ys in 2022? If so, how many TOTAL vehicles would Tesla have to sell in 2022 to make that happen? 2M? That certainly is not the guideance Tesla has given. Tesla's current production capacity is only 1M/year max. Is he saying production capacity (and sales) will actually double in 2022?

There is only 3% demand for EV cars worldwide and this with subsidies. Not to talk about when they are gone. One of the main reasons is the pain vast majority of potential EV users still get when they think about buying an EV. This pain gets only resolved through NIOs approach. True demand drivrn through intrinsic Motivation can only be created through a pain relieving product and this is what NIos whole business plan is, a huge pain reliever. The best is, the self growing intrinsic demand is accomplished, NIO has now started with the upscaling and will overtake China and then the world, nobody can compete with NIo. This is why sinopec decided itself for NIO, to bomb its 35000 gas stations with the NIO Battery approach and not with the stoneage garbage of Tsla, even better, NIo is planning to achieve 100 more of such deals like with sinopec IN 2021!

They brought it down to zero MPH and while the car was stopped, they climbed over the center console into the passenger seat never opening the door as that would disable Auto Pilot.

530,"Why Tesla Stock Looks Set To Rally FurtherTesla Net Income: The strong revenue growth will need to be accompanied by steady improvement in margins, with Tesla's Net Margins growing to over 21% in 2025This is possible, considering Tesla's increasing autonomous driving software sales and potential reductions in battery costs.This would translate into a Net Income of about $35 billion in 2025 and $280 billion in 2035. Tesla's Net Profit Margins could potentially be higher than rivals such as BMWThis is possible due to the company's increasing automation, improving economies of scale, declining battery costs, and higher software content in its vehicles.Tesla Revenues: If Tesla ramps up deliveries as detailed above, Total Revenues could potentially grow from $31 billion in 2020 to over $160 billion in 2025 and over $1.3 trillion in 2035.Tesla has been efficient in ramping up production capacityTesla has a fairly solid track record of scaling up production. Deliveries rose from about 2k cars in 2012 to 76k in 2016, 367k in 2019, and 500k cars in 2020.Tesla built-out its Chinese factory in a record 10 months and production is expected to scale from a run-rate of 250k cars per year, Tesla reports 499,550 vehicle deliveries for 2020.This means that Tesla should be able to build out new capacity and scale-up, as new models such as the Model Y and the Cybertruck are launched.Why is it possible for Tesla's Deliveries to jump to over 4 million by 2025 and 30 million by 2035? The auto market is sizable and Tesla is gaining ground with new models such as the Model 3, YGlobal automobile sales stood at about 88 million units in 2019 and the industry is electrifying at a rapid pace. For instance, the U.K wants to phase out gasoline cars by 2030. EVs look more like smartphones did for mobile phones back in 2008. All cars will practically be EVs over time. Being an early mover in this space, Tesla should have an edge in the market. As Tesla launches new models and the mix of EVs as a percentage of total global vehicle sales grows, the company could scale up sales meaningfully.Tesla Deliveries: While deliveries grew to almost 500k units in 2020, it is possible for deliveries to stand at close to 3.2 million cars by 2025 and around 30 million cars by 2035.Tesla's Deliveries grew 58% over 2015-20During its Q4 2020 earnings call, Tesla said that it expects 50% CAGR growth in deliveries over a multi-year horizon.While this appears lofty, it is possible for delivery growth to stand at 45% per year between 2020-25, declining to about 25% between 2025-35.If you buy and hold Tesla stock, the expectation is over time the near-term fluctuations will cancel out, and the long-term positive trend will favor you since the company is getting stronger and growing over the next few years and decades to dominate the EV market.",0.9975

Hintergrund ist, dass womöglich noch einmal Unterlagen zum Bau der Gigafactory öffentlich ausgelegt werden müssen. „Wenn es die komplexeste Form der Auslegung werden würde, dann sind wir bei drei Monaten“, sagte Brandenburgs Wirtschaftsminister Jörg Steinbach (SPD) nach Informationen des Handelsblatts am Mittwoch im Wirtschaftsausschuss des Potsdamer Landtages.Eine Aussage zum Zeitpunkt des Produktionsstarts der Fabrik machte der Minister nicht. Das Thema Verzögerung, sagte er indes, hänge mit dem Thema Auslegungsverfahren zusammen. 2. big quality issues in China Tesla muss sich bei Chinesin entschuldigenNach einem Zwischenfall auf der Shanghaier Automesse ist der US-Autobauer Tesla in China unter Druck geraten. Das Unternehmen entschuldigte sich schließlich, das Problem einer Kundin ""nicht schnell genug gelöst zu haben"". Staatsmedien sprachen von einer anfänglich ""anmaßenden Haltung"" des Autobauers, der sich in seiner ersten Reaktion ""kompromisslos"" gezeigt habe. TeslaTesla 596,70Die Kontroverse begann mit einem Protest der Frau, die am Montag auf dem Tesla-Stand auf der Automesse auf ein ""Model 3""-Auto gestiegen war und lauthals Bremsversagen beklagt hatte. Sie wurde von Sicherheitsleuten abgeführt. Die Videos gingen viral. Bislang sind keine Probleme mit den Bremsen bei Tesla bekannt, aber in Reaktionen beklagten Kunden wiederum andere Mängel ihrer Autos.Der US-Hersteller wies den Vorwurf der Frau zuerst zurück. Sie sei für ihre Proteste schon bekannt. Doch dann kommentierte die Staatsagentur Xinhua, die Qualität von Tesla müsse den Erwartungen entsprechen, um das Vertrauen der Verbraucher zu gewinnen. Auch die mächtige Rechtskommission der Kommunistischen Partei mischte sich ein, forderte Respekt vor chinesischen Verbrauchern und warf Tesla vor, nicht der Ursache des Problems nachgegangen zu sein.Derart unter Druck entschuldigte sich das Unternehmen und versprach, ""aktiv auf die Meinungen, Vorschläge und die Kritik unserer Kunden, Internetnutzer und Freunde in den Medien"" hören zu wollen.

1079,"Tesla Is Years Ahead Of Competitors With No Signs Of StoppingA lot of the leading car manufacturers in the world are playing catch up with Tesla. I believe this is because many of them simply didn’t believe that Tesla could deliver. But if you look at Tesla’s volume for the Tesla Model 3, there are some significant proof points that the company has. In fact, in December, the Tesla Model 3 was the third best-selling car in all of Europe. Tesla is not just eating into European car manufacturers’ hybrid sales, but also into their gas-powered vehicles as well. The automotive industry isn’t just made up of the auto manufacturers, it also includes suppliers and their partners as well, and in Germany this ecosystem is arguably the biggest. Many of the car manufacturers simply wrote Tesla off as a company that couldn’t execute and one that would never be successful. That was especially true of the Model 3, which has long been the company’s strategy for reaching a broader market and even more important, profitability. Tesla struggled mightily to deliver the Model 3 with numerous setbacks and stumbles, but eventually the company figured things out and started shipping Model 3s in volume and has shipped 400,000 vehicles thus far. Nobody really expected that Tesla would be able to ship 400,000 Model 3s by 2020, especially the European auto manufacturers. So much so, that both Mercedes and BMW have had significant shakeups including layoffs in the case of Mercedes and replacing the CEO in the case of BMW.Most of these impacts come from Tesla’s Model 3 and the vehicle’s success in selling into the same compact luxury sedan segments that BMW, Mercedes and Audi have the most volume in. The Model 3 is something different and something entirely faster and dramatically technologically more advanced. For example, the Tesla Model 3 Performance was put up against the BMW M3 last year by Top Gear and beat it in terms of track time and braking, which is quite unexpected for the performance version of Tesla’s ‘mainstream’ electric vehicle. The performance of the vehicle is fairly important to brand reputation and sales, but what’s even more important is the experience that the customer feels and the automated capabilities of the vehicle. That’s where Tesla is miles ahead of the competition. Many of Tesla’s competitors are still living in an era where a customer purchases a vehicle once and the only thing the manufacturer does is deal with warranty and recalls. On the other hand, with the initial introduction of centralized computing platforms based on NVIDIA, Tesla has effectively built a software-defined vehicle that is a constantly living and breathing platform evolving with the needs of users and Tesla’s roadmap over time. While Elon may have some lofty expectations for self-driving capability in Tesla vehicles, the company’s iterative approach to software is helping them inch ever closer to a self-driving vehicle beyond today’s Level2+ capabilities. The way that Tesla is able to accomplish this is through a multi-year effort to build their own high-performance custom computing architecture for FSD (Fully Self Driving) which includes multiple AI accelerators. Tesla is heavily using machine learning to accelerate what the car sees and how it can react to it while also adding features like Sentry Mode which give customers peace of mind. The system is not without its flaws, as the NTSB discovered in their investigation of a recent death in a Tesla where they blamed the company, CalTrans and the NHTSA. Tesla’s FSD computer, which to date is still not capable of ‘Fully Self Driving’, claims a compute performance of 144 trillion operations per second, a significant increase from their use of NVIDIA’s Drive PX2 in the previous version of Tesla’s compute solution. Tesla’s new FSD computer has capabilities that have dumbfounded the other auto manufacturers to the degree that they aren’t really sure what to do. A Nikkei tear-down of the Tesla Model 3 found that Tesla’s electronics are 6 years ahead of the #1 and #2 car manufacturers in the world, Toyota and VW. They even said an engineer at a major Japanese auto manufacturer was stunned, saying that, “we cannot do it.” This puts many of Tesla’s competitors at a significant disadvantage in terms of keeping up with the company’s capabilities and how close they could be to fully autonomous driving capability. With Tesla already putting the hurt on them last year, the near future doesn’t look bright for them unless they adapt, quickly. Car manufacturers are scrambling to respond to Tesla, they have been for quite some time. Some are partnering with companies like Waymo, while others are buying their own autonomous solutions like Argo.ai and Cruise. However, many of these companies still do not have access to the same hardware, software and chips that Tesla does, and while some of them have some experience in software, it’s what I would call rudimentary.https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorin",0.9991

1136,"After having speakinga with both, Sinpoec decided to make the greatest EV Deal in History with $NIO. Why did that happen?$Tsla has a Fokus on battery charging and denies battery swap while the chinese people, the current NIO users, have an extreme high subscription rate, nearly doubling in every ER/Quarter, this indicates that battery swap in general has a huge future in China, NIO has besides of that everything what Tsla has and more with mobile charging as a service. The best in NIOs universal approach is, it is open to all other ev companys thanks to William Lis mercy and his great target to fight the air pollution in China and now also the world. Even Tslas get charged with the mobile charging service of NIO in China.This is why Sinpoec decided to give the greatest EV deal in history to NIO: Because NIO has the much better battery approach with a great future.NIOs battery approach was created to act as a pain reliever, a pain reliever to create demand in people for EVs – still vast majority – who still prefer ICEs.NIO is converting ICE buyers while Tsla and others living from subsidies and some few individuals who want to safe the world.The infrastructure decides the future dominator of the market and NIO is already overtaking Tsla, despite Tslas advantages for a too long time through the chinese government. The honeymoon is over, the chinese public is waking up about Tslas garbage/dangerous quality and garbage/non existent service. Tsla will never be able to conquer a monopole position in China, not only because it never will be allowed through the chinese government but mainly due to NIO, already overtaking China with the power of its Intellectual and management capacitys, to execute the best business plan in history of mankind in Lightspeed. LIVE WITH IT OR WAKE UP WITH THE BAG! A few months ago I wrote that a rebalancing of your portfolios because of above will be needed and now look at the sector, so much trash stocks there where they started and even NIO is due to this sector panic right now on sale.

""We will eagerly wait for that data.""The crash is the 28th Telsa accident to be investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which regulates vehicle safety.It is also being probed by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which removed Tesla as a party to an earlier investigation into a fatal crash in 2018 after the company made public details of the probe without authorisation.In Saturday's accident, the 2019 Tesla Model S was traveling at high-speed near Houston when it failed to negotiate a curve and went off the road, crashing into a tree and bursting into flames, Herman said.Authorities found the bodies of two men in the car, one in the front passenger seat and the owner of the car in the backseat.""We have witness statements from people that said they left to test drive the vehicle without a driver and to show the friend how it can drive itself,"" Herman said.",0.8575

There are 8 revenue targets and 8 adjusted EBITA targets; each target achieved entitles Musk to an additional tranche (up to a maximum of 12).The revenue tranches are the more difficult. TSLA was expected to achieve the $35 billion revenue target this year which is only about 10% above 2020 revenues. It had appeared that TSLA might achieve the $55 billion target in 2022. It now seems possible that TSLA could achieve it in 2021, and in any case no later than 2022.The next revenue level is $75 billion, which is about 250% of 2020 revenue. This seems attainable if TSLA can sell 1.5 million vehicles in 2022.This would bring Musk up to 8 tranches of grants by the end of 2021, with an excellent chance of earning all 12 by the end of 2022.He is a very expensive CEO.Each tranche is worth over $5 billion to Musk at current TSLA prices.

But Tesla has said the driver must be ready to intervene at all times.Consumer Reports said that during several trips on its closed tracks with an empty driver’s seat, its Tesla Model Y automatically steered along painted lane lines without acknowledging that nobody was at the controls.In the Consumer Reports test, Fisher said he engaged Autopilot while the car was in motion on the track, then set the speed dial to zero to stop it. Fisher then affixed a small, weighted chain on the steering wheel to simulate the weight of a driver’s hand. He then slid over into the front passenger seat where he was able to accelerate and decelerate the vehicle.“The car drove up and down the half-mile lane of our track, repeatedly, never noting that no one was in the driver’s seat, never noting that there was no one touching the steering wheel, never noting there was no weight on the seat,” Fisher said. “It was a bit frightening when we realized how easy it was to defeat the safeguards, which we proved were clearly insufficient.”Consumer Reports noted the test was performed on its closed track and that “under no circumstances should anyone try” to duplicate it.""Let me be clear: Anyone who uses Autopilot on the road without someone in the driver seat is putting themselves and others in imminent danger,"" Fisher said.",0.9543

Not suitable as a working man's truck or a fleet vehicle.Charging Network - Plenty of competition from ChargePoint, Blink and others.Storage - The only bright spot in Tesla's product line besides cars, but not profitable yet and plenty of competition.At this point Tesla is still just an unprofitable car company. They may get a boost from the Infrastructure Plan, but ultimately their $750B market cap needs to come into alignment with VW, GM, Ford, and Toyota. So either those companies' stocks need to increase 3X to 8X or Tesla's stock price needs to drop by 70% to 90%.",0.9702

1705,"TSLA may get battered in the short term but only an idiot thinks TSLA won't return to the highs and then roar past them over the long haul. With EVs not even yet close to serving their total addressable market, and TSLA's cars for the moment being superior to the competition, only an idiot thinks this stock is going to 0. The P/E will contract on its own over time through earnings without the stock having to crater. Shorts have the same thesis now that they did when the company first went public despite the fact the company's long term prospects continue to improve. Let's assume cars are TSLA's only business...even with new competition all TSLA has to do is maintain its market share and volume and revenues will multiply 17 times minimum. The idea TSLA won't continue to come out with new and improved cars over time too is a big fallacy. TSLA has a family of vehicles, not just one car. Now, let's add in the other dimensions to its business. TSLA also makes batteries, chips, and is a technology and solar company. Factoring all this in, it's easy to see why competition won't cause TSLA to implode, because the other car companies don't make their own batteries or chips. Betting against TSLA for the long haul is like betting the sun won't come up tomorrow. The decline from the highs has been on largely non company specific news. When it's the company itself that has a problem then shorts have an argument for an implosion. Right now they had better count their lucky stars. Soon the market will find its footing and TSLA will roar higher. Not a question of if it will but when.",0.9952

To put it in context against the most popular crypto stock in the world (Coinbase), $COIN only holds 4487 BTC and has no plans of acquiring more. Meanwhile, BFARF are going to be growing their inventory consistently from now on.. meaning that by the end of the year, they could conceivably have more BTC than $COIN. The next targets would be $TSLA and $MSTR (which hold 48,000 bitcoin and 91,579 bitcoin respectively.) How long will it take for BitFarms to hold that kind of BTC supply? It may take some time, but consider $MSTR's holding, which constitutes a staggering 82% of Microstrategy’s valuation... That company trades at $693 today. If you're planning to hold $BFARF for the long-haul, remain dominant against $HUTMF, $RIOT, and $MARA.. $BTC-USD continues to rise, technology keeps advancing against difficulty increases and they're able to keep up the current rate of BTC production, the question of a NASDAQ listed $BFARF reaching a valuation similar to $MSTR is not a matter of if... but when.

Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS). “But the stability of these batteries has always been poor.”Now, Li and his team have designed a stable, lithium-metal solid state battery that can be charged and discharged at least 10,000 times — far more cycles than have been previously demonstrated — at a high current density.

2064,"Behind ARK Invest's $3,000 Target Price for TeslaThe electric vehicle manufacturer, however, is on the correct path from a financial performance perspective, which is evident from the fact that 2020 was the first-ever profitable year for the company. For many years, Wall Street analysts questioned the ability of Tesla to become profitable, and the company achieved this on the back of strong revenue growth (from $204 million in 2011 to $31.5 billion in 2020).ARK Invest, which has a reputation for identifying high-growth companies earlier than the rest of the investing public, recently published a research report assigning a target price of $3,000 per share for Tesla by 2025, suggesting the company is significantly undervalued at the closing market price of $611.29 on March 29.ARK's investment thesisThis is not the first time ARK Invest has come up with a rich valuation for Tesla. In 2018, Ark Invest founder Catherine Wood (Trades, Portfolio) set a target price of $800 for Tesla's stock while it was trading at just $70, which seemed irrational at the time. However, the shares surged past $800 earlier this year, proving the fund manager was right on the mark.ARK had previously forecast a 30% probability of Tesla delivering autonomous cars by 2024, and it now believes there is a 50% probability of this happening by 2025. According to the firm, the rollout of autonomous vehicles will be one of the most important steps in the growth story of Tesla.In addition to this, ARK expects Tesla to achieve cost efficiencies in the next few years along with the expected increase in vehicle production. In its research report, ARK refers to Wright's Law on multiple instances, suggesting the production costs of future vehicles will decline significantly in the coming years, paving the way for Tesla to report high operating margins.Tesla, to its merit, has been keeping up pace with its stated objectives as well. For instance, the company announced a plan to deliver 500,000 vehicles in 2020 before the economic recession came to light, and ended the year by delivering 499,550 vehicles worldwide. The company's ability to deliver on its seemingly impossible promises is one of the key factors ARK has taken into consideration in its valuation model.Macroeconomic outlookDespite the economic upheaval caused by the Covid-19 virus-induced recession and the closure of the Tesla factory in California, the company manufactured 36% more cars in 2020 in comparison to 2019, which gives a glimpse of the strength of its global manufacturing plants. Strategically investing in China to manufacture vehicles locally proved to be a differentiator in 2020, and is likely to be a value driver in the long run as China is the world's largest market for electric vehicles.The price of electric car batteries plays an important role in the profitability of Tesla. Over the past decade, the price of these components has dropped significantly, making it cheaper for Tesla to manufacture vehicles. According to Adele Peters at Fast Company, the price of batteries has fallen to $137 per kilowatt-hour from $1,110 in 2011, and these significant cost-savings can be passed on to consumers as well, making electric vehicles much more competitive in comparison to gasoline-powered vehicles. According to data from Statista, Tesla is the clear leader of the electric vehicle industry globally, and this market-leading position paints a promising picture of what the future holds for the company given that cost of production is expected to decline sharply.Tesla is the largest clean energy company in the world and is on its way to becoming the most valuable automotive company as well. In addition to Tesla's battery-powered vehicles, the company also supplies solar power to residential and corporate customers under Tesla Energy. The company has a favorable outlook for the energy business considering the radical changes implemented by governments around the world to embrace clean energy solutions in a bid to promote the use of environmentally-friendly energy sources.There are two major threats to Tesla's success, which need to be monitored carefully.The increasing competition in the automobile industry.The probability of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations.Tesla is enjoying first-mover advantages to the fast-growing electric vehicle industry, and these advantages, which include high brand awareness and consumer loyalty, might help it thwart the threat of competition for a long period of time. However, the relatively young nature of the industry presents other automakers with an opportunity to gain market share by introducing high-quality products, so Tesla will have to continue investing in the business to retain its market leadership.Tesla remains focused on innovationThe founder and CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, is expected to unveil at least a couple of new vehicles by https://finance.yahoo.com/news/behind-ark-invests-3-000-170030637.html",0.9994

2307,"The prospects for Tesla have become increasingly cloudy.The stocks already took a dip from unsustainable levels before it became clear that inflation and interest rates are picking up, and that the central banks will sooner or later have to withdraw from their policies of ultra-cheap money. This has already caused some rotation out of growth stocks whose business models and IRR expectations depend heavily on low interest rates, i.e. moderate discounting of future earnings.This process has only just begun, and for sure stock prices will not decline in a straight line but they will.For Tesla, the market environment has changed particularly. It has become clear that substantial competition is coming up faster that expected, and recent sales figures have not been overly reassuring. The pandemic will stay for a while, the 3rd wave is already running through Europe and it will also reach the US. The environment does not allow a significant pick up in car sales.Then we also have the chip shortage, causing production cuts and not even allowing to fulfill the actual demand.On top of all of that, Tesla is running into problems in China, the decisive market for all car manufacturer these days. Chinese officials have questioned Tesla`s integrity regarding data handling. While this is only relevant for government properties in the first step, it will impact the overall market. Chinese customers are very sensitive when it comes to integrity of their personal data, they are already exposed to extensive surveillance of their private lives. This is not a good sign for Tesla`s market prospects in China.With all of that background, we need to expect the Tesla stock to pull back significantly. Everybody knows that, but for sure the prominent market players need to avoid a stampede. This goes for the overall market (this is why Mr. Powell shows up frequently to reassure the market that all will be good), and this goes for Tesla in particular (this is why Ark Invest issues astronomical price targets). Everyone wants the upcoming process to be as smoothly and quietly as possible, in order to allow themselves to pull out in an orderly fashion.Cathy Wood is fully loaded with Tesla. Her funds have reached the max. Tesla holding allowed, so she can't even push the stock with her own means any longer (apart from rosy price predictions). Now, with the current situation evolving, she needs to find a way out which at the same time allows her to save her face.You can rest assured that she will - and that other big players - will find a way out somehow. They are well coordinated with these things, and they have the means and tools to get out without major damage to their numbers. The damage will remain with the smaller, individual investors. Those which are either involved in the Ark funds, or who hold shares directly.They will suffer the pain if they stick with the stock too long.THIS is the right time to get out of the stock. It is still heavily overvalued, given the actual market conditions and Tesla`s prospects going forward. At the same time, this provides a unique opportunity to sell the shares at decent prices before the inevitable market correction.This is no financial advice, just my 2 Cents. I really like the cars. I admire Elon Musk for his entrepreneurial vision.The stock prices are however unsustainably inflated.You need to make your own choices. Anyway, whatever you do, pls be ultra-critical when it comes to the professionals reassuring you that all will go on like before, and that TSLA will go to the moon.

After that, it was simply cooling the car as the batteries continued to have a chain reaction due to damage.“We could not tear it apart or move it around to get ‘final extinguishment’ because the fact that we had two bodies in there and it was then an investigation-slash-crime scene. We had to keep it cool, were on scene for four hours, but we were simply pouring a little bit of water on it. It was not because flames were coming out. It was a reaction in the battery pan. It was not an active fire,” Buck said.“We did not (call Tesla), and I do not know where (that rumor) came from. There is a chance someone else did, maybe the Harris County Fire Marshal, but we did not call (Tesla). Tesla has an emergency manual for first responders,” Buck said.

Then after a few profitable (key word) years they invest one or two billion and do a redesign. Teslas Model S was never profitable. Like the Roadster it never sold enough copies to make money. As the design aged Tesla couldn't find buyers - even with lowered prices: Model S sales in the USA:2016 - 29,4212017 - 27,0602018 - 25,7452019 - 14,1002020- 17,500Model S Sales in Europe2017 - 16,0262018 - 17,3862019 - 8,6352020 - 5,562 <== Yes these are annual sales numbers not monthly sales",0.9802

(""NanoXplore"") (TSX-V: GRA and OTCQX: NNXPF) and Martinrea International Inc. (“Martinrea”) (TSX: MRE) announce that they have formed a joint venture, VoltaXplore Inc. (“VoltaXplore”), a battery-based initiative to service the electric transportation and grid storage market.VoltaXplore will initially build a demonstration facility to develop and produce electric vehicle (EV) batteries enhanced with graphene, one of the world’s thinnest and strongest materials, with tremendous characteristics. The venture combines NanoXplore’s position as a world leader in the science and production of graphene and graphene-enhanced materials and Martinrea’s expertise as a leading manufacturer of automotive and industrial parts, specializing in Lightweight Structures and Propulsion Systems. VoltaXplore will be developing and manufacturing Li-Ion battery cells for electric vehicles initially in a new 1MWh facility in Montreal. The joint venturers believe that graphene-enhanced batteries will considerably improve existing battery performance.Following a successful demonstration of improved battery performance using graphene and based on positive customer feedback as well as building the business case, VoltaXplore intends to build and commission a 10GWh battery cell manufacturing facility in Canada.NanoXplore and Martinrea have each invested $4 million initially into VoltaXplore as startup capital to support the construction of demonstration facility, with each committed to provide up to an additional $6 million in development funding if, as and when required. NanoXplore and Martinrea each hold a 50% equity interest in VoltaXplore. Pat D’Eramo, Martinrea’s President and CEO, will be VoltaXplore’s Chairman and Soroush Nazarpour, NanoXplore’s founder and CEO, will be VoltaXplore’s CEO. Both are the initial directors. Each company will provide critical scientific, development and manufacturing expertise as appropriate.Soroush Nazarpour commented:“Graphene is a really exciting material for improved performance in Li-ion batteries. It increases the charging speed and capacity of the batteries while improving safety by enabling batteries to work at lower temperatures. VoltaXplore will benefit from using NanoXplore’s graphene-enhanced silicon anode formulation and will manufacture cylindrical Li-ion cells. One of the keys to an electric vehicle future is significantly improved batteries, and we believe we can be a part of the solution, both at VoltaXplore and as a graphene provider at NanoXplore. We believe the successful development of graphene enhanced batteries will result in the need for high volumes of graphene powder. We continue to benefit from our partnership with Martinrea, and this is another step in our successful working relationship.”Pat D’Eramo commented:“We are an increasing part of the EV landscape, and are very excited to continue to work with NanoXplore, as we have to date in manufacturing operations and in developing the world’s first graphene-enhanced brake lines that will go on vehicles this summer. Martinrea continues to expand its EV product portfolio, including battery trays and electric motor housings, where we have product wins with leading customers, including OEMs and EV suppliers such as Samsung. VoltaXplore is a natural next step for us, as we combine our abilities to make great products with NanoXplore’s leading work in the graphene space.’’About NanoXplore Inc.NanoXplore is a graphene company, a manufacturer and supplier of high-volume graphene powder for use in industrial markets. NanoXplore provides standard and custom graphene-enhanced plastic and composite products to various customers in transportation, packaging, electronics, and other industrial sectors.

This is included in their service revenue. It is cars that are coming back to them for resale, either through returns (which they stopped their 'money back guarantee' in Q1 I believe) and a pretty significant number of barely used cars coming up for sale. I don't follow it closely enough to know whether their 'problem cars' are coming back super quickly, but this was the case in 2018 with all of the manufacturing defects. Perhaps the 10Q will provide more insight, but the company is highlighting this as a 'strong' part of the business, but sooner or later all of those used cars are going to haunt the company. When they start cannibalizing sales of new cars with over priced used cars, they will be skimming the low end . . . All very interesting that mass market psychology hasn't turned on them yet.

Like Arkk. Any increase on Monday below 10% will just be a normal hiccup and below 5% or even a drop will just accelerate decline.

The valuation is sky-high, and every bit of possible good news over the next 10 years, including FSD rollout, growth of vehicle sales, and eventual profitability of the energy business, all has already been baked into the current price. So.... no surprise it's difficult for the stock to climb higher for any reason other than pure emotion, and the hype is beginning to wear off. Tesla fanboys are wildly overestimating the utility of FSD and wildly underestimating the time (many years) required for regulatory approvals, infrastructure improvements needed before full deployment, and there will be an abundance of time for competitors (many of whom may already have a significant lead on Tesla) to step in and force FSD prices lower, which will crush margins on this business. Do not put your trust in the analysts. Sell-side analysts will always give you wildly high targets while raking in commission fees on selling the stock. Wake up, folks. Same stuff happens every bubble. As for the Tesla insurance business, if you want to see this shredded to pieces, simply look at Chris Bloomstran’s arguments regarding Tesla’s capital constraints for insurance --- I’ve never seen a more complete public humiliation of an analyst report, and it proves ARK’s (yes, Cathie Wood’s) lack of understanding on this business. The upcoming earnings call will be full of more false promises and more excuses on repeatedly failed timelines on FSD. Musk will probably blame the regulators again... because it's much easier to blame someone else than admit failure on his promises to customers and shareholders. Young investors seem to have no clue the impact higher interest rates will have on speculative growth stocks like TSLA. Guys, seriously, it completely changes the game. Interest rates are like gravity, and TSLA will crash harder than anything, as if it needed another reason to, beyond sheer overvaluation. A stock rally based on emotion and excitement always runs out of fuel eventually. I've seen it a thousand times. It doesn't even require any bad news, just a lack of good news to dull the excitement, and then the number of sellers begins to slowly overpower the buyers. Good luck and be safe.",0.9908

3158,"The path to $1,071 - Tesla is underappreciatedDorsheimer more than doubled his price target for Tesla, increasing it from $419 to $1,071. In addition, the analyst changed his rating on the stock from hold to buy.While Tesla makes most of its revenue from electric cars, the analyst's upgrade for the stock today has a lot to do with his bullish view for the company's solar and energy storage business. He believes Tesla's energy generation and storage business could rake in $8 billion of revenue annually by 2025 thanks to an ""Apple-esque ecosystem of energy products"" and ""harmonized electrification."" Dorsheimer thinks that as Tesla resolves the battery cell supply shortage it said it was facing in its most recent quarterly update, the company is well positioned to grow the business through sales of its energy storage products. He also believes Tesla is several years ahead of the competition in energy storage, giving it an edge. Momentum in energyThough Tesla's electric-car business gets more attention than its energy storage business since that's where the bulk of the company's sales come from, energy storage deployments actually grew faster in 2020 than electric-car sales. Total energy storage deployments, measured in gigawatt hours (GWh), increased 83% year over year to 3 GWh in 2020.""This growth was driven mainly by the popularity of Megapack, our utility scale storage product,"" Tesla told investors in its fourth-quarter update. ""Powerwall demand continues to increase as the residential business continues to grow.""Impressively, this growth came even as production was limited. ""Our energy storage business continues to be supply constrained as backlog remains strong,"" Tesla said. But its efforts to increase cell production will help the company ramp up supply ""in the next few months."" Because of this, the automaker anticipates its energy storage business will grow at approximately the same rate in 2021 as it did in 2020.Tesla's solar business is growing slower, with megawatts of solar deployments increasing 18% in 2020 from the prior year. But this segment saw accelerated growth in the fourth quarter, when deployments grew 59% year over year.While investors should be sure to do their own due diligence on Tesla stock, Dorsheimer does highlight an often-underappreciated aspect of the business that could become a significant contributor to Tesla's bottom line.",0.9967

3337,"Understanding how Musk is a con-artist is just a matter of looking. Take, for example, his introduction of ""solar shingles"" when he was trying to use Tesla's stock to bail out the bankrupt SolarCity (saving his cousins and himself from losing millions). The solar-shingle roll-out was Theranos-level fraud. There was no product, no research and development; it was a mock-up of fake shingles (on fake houses -- all done on a Hollywood movie studio set); there was NO energy being generated by any of the tiles, yet Musk stood in front of the crowd explaining how all those roofs around them were generating energy.Or look at Musk's claim -- way back when the stock was under $400, pre-split -- that he had the ""funding secured"" to take the company private. The CEO of a multi-billion dollar company telling millions of followers on social media a complete lie just to juice the stock price -- and the Board and shareholders didn't boot him out after that nonsense?!Or even consider how Musk seems compelled to lie about relatively little things -- and can easily be caught in those lies -- such as the defense he used for calling Unsworth a ""pedo guy""; Musk claimed the term ""pedo guy"" wasn't any insult suggesting one was engaging in certain criminal sexual behavior, but that it was a term, common in his native South Africa, that just means ""creepy old man."" People in South Africa reacted, ""Say what?"" -- it's a bald-faced lie that the term is such an insult in South Africa.Or look at Musk's statements about the bankruptcy that almost happened when Tesla was trying to ramp production of the Model 3. Musk claimed, after the fact, that Tesla was ""single digit weeks"" away from bankruptcy during the Model 3 ramp -- the problem is, this ""single digit weeks"" from bankruptcy never showed itself in the company's SEC-filed financial statements; they always showed they had solvency out about a year or more. Their auditors never required any ""going-concern"" warning with their audited statements. The only conclusion: there are two sets of books and Musk was aware of a bankruptcy risk being just days away, while the other set of books -- provided to the SEC and public-investor -- showed much better solvency.Or just look at the bovine excrement Musk pushes to SpaceX investors -- it's too long of a topic to discuss here, but The Common Sense Skeptic has made an excellent video series (available on YouTube) that debunks the sort of nonsense Musk spews while promoting SpaceX.Musk is a con artist, plain and simple. While that doesn't mean the entire company of Tesla is like a Theranos, it is very likely similar to Enron's type of fraud. Enron did approximately $80 billion of legitimate business a year before its bankruptcy; it was a relatively small amount of accounting fraud at the top -- which hid the true financial condition of the company from shareholders -- that brought the company down. Tesla is a real company, just not a profitable one. While it has shown losses for most of its life, I see enough evidence to conclude those losses were actually a lot LARGER than have been reported; and those quarters of ""profitability"" that got the company into the S&P 500 were all just an accounting fabrication.Silicon Valley start-ups have a saying, ""Fake it until you make it."" It's essentially an admission that lying is OK while you're trying to build a business. That can work with some technology companies because the profit margins in certain technology companies can be so high, a company can actually make up (and permanently bury) for its previous lying while growing the company. I think Musk has used this ""fake it"" strategy with Tesla -- the problem is: Tesla is a CAR company, with low margins; there is no high-margin pot-of-gold at the end of its growth-stages. My conclusion (looking at a lot more evidence than the few items I mention here): Tesla is a house-of-cards with massive losses hidden using accounting tricks. (I actually suspect SpaceX and The Boring Co are being used in ways similar to the way Enron used its ""SPVs."") Ultimately, I expect it will implode like Enron did.",0.7947

3411,"Could Tesla's Vehicle Deliveries Soar 85% This Year?Here's why the electric-car maker could see a substantial acceleration in its growth rate this yearTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was up against some significant headwinds last year. Not only did the automaker face tough year-ago comparisons when soaring Model 3 deliveries led to 50% growth in vehicle deliveries, but it had to pause manufacturing in the spring of 2020 as it dealt with lockdowns related to COVID-19. Yet the electric-car maker still managed to grow vehicle deliveries 36% for the year.Though Tesla's 2020 performance was impressive, it might look modest in comparison to the automaker's 2021 sales. The current consensus estimate for Tesla's vehicle deliveries this year is 850,000 units, up from about 500,000 in 2020. Indeed, one of the most recent analyst forecasts calls for 929,000 deliveries this year, which would mark growth of more than 85% year over year. Tesla's Models S, X, 3, and Y lined up on a road with mountains in the background.MODELS S, X, 3, AND Y. IMAGE SOURCE: TESLA.HTTPS://TS.LA/TESLAPRESSKITWhy deliveries should skyrocketIt's not too surprising to see analysts so bullish on Tesla's deliveries in 2021. The automaker has been making remarkable progress on expanding its production capacity. Going into 2020, Tesla had installed tooling at its factories for annualized production capacity of 640,000 units. By the end of the year, Tesla's installed annualized production capacity had reached 1.05 million vehicles.Yet even these figures don't fully capture Tesla's manufacturing momentum. The company also had two production lines under construction at the end of the year -- a Model Y production line at its new factory in Berlin, Germany, and another one at its new factory in Texas. Tesla said in its fourth-quarter update that it expects to begin vehicle production at these new factories this year.What to watchFortunately, Tesla investors will soon get better insight into whether analysts' optimistic outlook for the automaker's deliveries is realistic. The company will release its first-quarter financial results on April 26. Tesla's updates usually provide insight into recent delivery trends, demand, and more.We already know Tesla kicked off the year with strong first-quarter deliveries, as it announced its quarterly deliveries ahead of its earnings report. Tesla delivered approximately 185,000 vehicles, up 109% year over year. However, other information in the earnings report should still be helpful to investors when assessing the company's growth potential. First and foremost, investors should look for any commentary from management on demand for its vehicles. Obviously, Tesla needs more than strong growth in production; it needs similarly high levels of demand, too.In addition, investors can look to see if Tesla provides an updated view for its deliveries this year. So far, the automaker has only said that it expects total 2021 deliveries to increase more than 50% compared to 2020 deliveries.Tesla will report its first-quarter results after market close on Monday, April 26.Good luck and GOD bless,",0.9993

3535,"Interestingly enough, Buck remarked that his team actually managed to put down the fire within two to three minutes, which was enough for authorities to see that there were occupants in the vehicle. After these first two to three minutes, it was only a matter of keeping the batteries as cool as possible by pouring small amounts of water into the damaged battery pack. Buck described the fire department’s strategy in the following statement. “With respect to the fire fight, unfortunately, those rumors grew way out of control. It did not take us four hours to put out the blaze. Our guys got there and put down the fire within two to three minutes, enough to see the vehicle had occupants. After that, it was simply cooling the car as the batteries continued to have a chain reaction due to damage.“We could not tear it apart or move it around to get ‘final extinguishment’ because the fact that we had two bodies in there and it was then an investigation-slash-crime scene. We had to keep it cool, were on scene for four hours, but we were simply pouring a little bit of water on it. It was not because flames were coming out. It was a reaction in the battery pan. It was not an active fire,” Buck said.As for the rumors that the fire department had to call a Tesla hotline for tips on how to handle a battery fire, the Fire Chief stated that these reports were untrue. “We did not (call Tesla), and I do not know where (that rumor) came from. There is a chance someone else did, maybe the Harris County Fire Marshal, but we did not call (Tesla). Tesla has an emergency manual for first responders,” Buck said. He also noted that he is not aware of Tesla having a hotline for tips on how to control a battery fire. Buck also provided some new details about the Model S crash and how the fire department was involved. According to the fire chief, the first calls about the incident did not involve reports about a car at all. Instead, initial reports were about a fire in the woods. And while the Model S fire was notable when the firefighters arrived, it only took minutes to control the blaze from the vehicle.",-0.2628

Solid State Batteries are getting closer and closer and better and better.Perhaps by the time Tesla has a 4680 plant up and running the SSB will be just a few months away, making the whole thing practically . . . impractical?

LOTS and LOTS of competition is coming, I don't see anything happening in 2021 that isn't already baked into the stock price.

3920,"TSLA has never been about retail and institutional investors making sure profits on a regular basis (the Wall Street mantra). It’s about moving the world towards energy sustainability and getting excess carbon out of the atmosphere. It’s been evident that any profits that Tesla makes (except for the small ones for the last 5 quarters) go right back into growing the company. Tesla was not set up for day traders, shorts or the competition to make a killing. One of its goals is to encourage other manufacturers to switch to electric transportation. Even if Elon Musk becomes a multiple trillionaire his previous actions and interest indicate his wealth will go right back into other Earth-improving projects and space ventures. Gigafactories don’t come cheap. Micromanaging and second guessing Elon Musk just doesn’t come into play. Don’t know if he will pull it all off. But it’s been a wise bet in the past to go along with him in the long term. He is better at what he does than anyone else doing what he does. He’s a genius, visionary, eccentric at times, unpredictable, adverse to risk and always doubles down. Sure there were missteps and failures along the way. But they ikturned into learning opportunities and with persistence applied to further success. He does particularly well with his enterprises that are closely held companies with only a few private investors and not subject to “slings and arrows” of the general market place. There is no guarantee with any stock that it will perform or even be worth what was paid for it. He’s not perfect but is a far cry from being reckless and irresponsible. Innovators always have headwinds. Ride too bumpy to own this stock? Fine, stay with the blue chips and “sure bets”. It’s prudent to make a risky investment a small part of a diversified portfolio. Best wishes for your investments and good luck.",0.9973

Tesla is clearly not selling all the Model S/X vehicles they COULD make -- and since margins/profits are so much better on the S/X (compared to the Model 3) they certainly WOULD be producing more S/X models if they could sell them.Look at the specific delivery numbers on Tesla's Model S and X vehicles from the time they first started to report deliveries of Model 3s -- that would be Q3 2017: In Q3 2017 Tesla delivered 25,915 Model S and X vehicles. In the 4th quarter of 2017, they delivered 28,425. In 2018, Tesla delivered (each quarter respectively): 21,815; 22,300; 27,710; 25,161 S/X vehicles.

Guess what happened next??https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB955485845794159366""So far, however, analysts such as Morgan Stanley's Mr. Kelly have been right on the money. Indeed, an investor who followed Mr. Kelly's ""strong buy"" recommendation back in 1990 and held the stock for 10 years would be up 111,900% on the investment, after nine stock splits. And there is no sign that the momentum-style investing that has carried stocks like Cisco to their current levels is about to change anytime soon.Even more extraordinary, however, is how readily Wall Street has set down its old tool kit for valuing the shares of big tech companies.""I spend a good deal of my time talking with investors these days about valuations,"" Mr. Kelly says. ""And it is a bit of an art. But with the stock's P/E ratio above 100, my job is to say how will investors value the stock going forward. How I feel about it isn't important,"" he says.Like I said, guess what happened next? Take a look at the CSCO chart in 2000. History doesn't repeat but it often rhymes.",0.9803

4207,"All I see is shorts spamming. Not a single person this week, or ever, has provided any fundamental criticism. When you're paid to spam, all you're good for is getting reported for spam. I've been a long in many winners over the years because I had conviction in the company & their products/services. These include $TSLA, $NIO, $ROKU, $AMD, $JD just to name a few. Every single one I had conviction and have profited in hundreds to thousands of percentages with each. $XPEV is no different for me. The market momentum in the past month or so is driven by unfounded fear...this week's knee jerk selling due to already known inflation is disproportionate to the concern. EV stocks have gained popularity from last year as many new investors had fomo. That money moved to new viral crypto gambles this year as institutions pulled strings to make profits from all of their own losses from those viral plays they missed out on. So they have been driving the prices down in the EV sector for months to cheapen the price, knowing full well the adoption of EVs in China is going to be absolutely tremendous. In the next few weeks, you'll see filings by many hedge funds that have picked up millions of shares of XPEV and NIO. Every MM knows 5-10x upside to both of these stocks, as they both had great earnings this quarter with plenty of cash on hand, higher deliveries every month, and increased revenue. The entire market moved in sync today to bring down the prices as overblown fear was the catalyst, but the VIX sunk more than everything. People have liquidated from crypto and that money is going to also enter the stock market after learning how a couple of viral tweets doesn't just fly you to the moon, but can also bring you crashing down even quicker. Tech stocks have been overly punished in general. XPEV specifically had even indicated today they had already taken steps to allocate parts to minimize any disruption to production. Recent delivery numbers prove that XPEV is achieving that goal. EV stocks will come back very strong and these prices are a gift for all those that have been looking for a long entry.

4297,"The tractor was equipped with several standard safety features. Namely, the tractor had a seat contact switch (“dead man’s switch”), which was located between the seat suspension and the seat frame. This switch prevents engine startup/running when the seat is unoccupied. Additionally, the tractor was equipped with both a clutch safety switch and a neutral safety switch, which requires the clutch to be disengaged and the transmission to be in the neutral position for the engine to start.Examination of the tractor after the accident revealed that all three of these safety devices had been electrically bypassed, or “shorted,” at some time prior to the incident. This was the result of a “jumper” wire installed across the two wires associated with each switch. A jumper tricks the tractor into thinking that the seat is occupied, the transmission is in neutral, and the clutch is depressed when, in fact, those things may not be true. These conditions prevented the safety devices from functioning properly, allowing the tractor to start and continue running while unattended. Witnesses familiar with the operator indicated that he routinely started the tractor as he stood beside it, placing him squarely in front of the large, left-rear tire. While it was unclear who had performed the modification, the tractor was able to start while the operator stood beside it, and apparently the operator was aware of this fact.On the morning of the accident, the operator started the tractor in his usual fashion but neglected to ensure that the transmission had been placed in the neutral position. The tractor started and lurched forward, and the operator was consequentially crushed as the left rear wheel drove over him followed by the pull-behind mower. The mower deck trapped and dragged the operator as the tractor continued to move forward unattended through the parking lot before impacting a parked vehicle. Coworkers found him unconscious and fatally injured.Moral is people bypass safety switches all the time and cause injury or death...it is not a machine issue...it is a people issue.",-0.5642

4365,"Tesla owners love their cars a lot. Their views of CEO Elon Musk are much more nuanced, according to results of a survey by research group Escalent.Tesla's one-stop shopping for everything from financing to fast charging is a huge plus for the brand, the firm said, and it's one GM and Ford may not be able to replicate.Most people in the auto industry assume Tesla buyers are drawn to the brand's high-tech image. The real reason is simpler, and far more traditional: They like the cars. The results showed that Tesla vehicles appeal to both EV owners and those who intend to buy an electric car within five years. Their reasons are similar to what automakers hope for when launching any new product, whatever it's powered by. EV owners and intenders saw Teslas as alluring for their styling, performance and acceleration, build quality, and the fact that they're new and different. Battery range was the sole attribute among the top five named that is specific to electric cars.The study contains many other nuggets about Tesla and how it's viewed. Its youth as a company is of little concern, and in fact most respondents saw it as a positive. Because the company is fully committed to EVs, ""there's nothing close to it,"" said one participant.And Tesla's Apple-like “one-stop experience” proved a huge plus for owners. Its ability to manage all aspects of EV purchase and ownership—sales, financing, service, fast charging, and route planning that incorporates fast charging—were cited by an overwhelming 91 percent of owners as a reason to buy another Tesla. That, Dovorany suggested, is an ecosystem traditional makers will struggle mightily to replicate.Finally, getting people behind the wheel of an EV was widely seen as the best single way to convince shoppers that the cars were real and could work for them. Many owners reported they became much more open to buying an EV after knowing friends, family, or co-workers who had one. https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35797034/survey-tesla-buyers-not-musk-fans/",0.9962

GM plans to introduce 30 new EVs globally by 2025, with Ford also expected to offer 30 of its own EVs by the middle of the decade.Another problem that can't be swept under the rug with the Tesla buy thesis is its income statements. Even though it reported its first full-year profit in 2020, it was only profitable because it sold regulatory emission credits to other automakers. In all four quarters of 2020, Tesla would have reported a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) loss without its regulatory credits. When a $703 billion company hasn't even shown the ability to generate a GAAP profit from selling its core product, warning flags should be going off in your head. The final worry is that all next-big-thing investment bubbles eventually burst. For more than a quarter of a century, we've watched as the internet, genomics, business-to-business commerce, marijuana, 3D-printing, blockchain, and a host of other major trends all soared and eventually burst.

4741,Try to wrap your head around this. Tesla is valued at roughly the equivalent of the entire auto industry while selling just a tiny fraction of the world’s cars. Pumpers say it’s because it’s more than a car company. But 95% of revenues come from auto sales. And without regulatory credits and Bitcoin they don’t even make a profit on those sales. Full autonomy probably not happening this decade. And when it dies it’s highly speculative Tesla will be a big winner there. So how do we get to a $750 billion valuation? Solar roofs? ,0.9875

I think TSLA could achieve ""reported earnings"" in 2021 closer to the consensus $9.41 shown by E*trade's page for 2024.Based on that earnings, TSLA might be worth as much as $100/share (something over 10 times earnings, which is what is typical for the industry) in 2021.Of course the dreamers think they can project growth into the future and anticipate that TSLA might be earning as much as $50/share by 2030.

Over several trips across half-mile closed test track, the Model Y automatically steered along painted lane lines, the magazine said.""In our evaluation, the system not only failed to make sure the driver was paying attention, but it also couldn't tell if there was a driver there at all,"" said Jake Fisher, senior director of Consumer Reports' auto testing. ""Tesla is falling behind other automakers like GM and Ford that, on models with advanced driver assist systems, use technology to make sure the driver is looking at the road.""Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.The report also comes amid growing scrutiny over Tesla's semi-automated driving system following recent accidents and as it is preparing to launch its updated ""full self-driving"" software to more customers.Tesla's Autopilot is a driver assistance system that handles some driving tasks and allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel at times, but Tesla says its features ""require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous",0.8712

The bitcoin will be marked down to the lowest price attained in a reporting period with the write down being treated as a restructuring or other expense (so not in reported earnings).With a volatile bubble like asset like bitcoin, either the prices just go straight up, in which case there obviously will be profits that can be tapped at will to enhance a weak quarter, or, they go up and down, in which case the downward move will give an opportunity to push the ""cost"" of the bitcoin down with a restructuring expense, thereby ensuring an unrealized profit in the future to be included in earnings when needed.From the 10k "" In determining if an impairment has occurred, we consider the lowest market price of one bitcoin quoted on the active exchange since acquiring the bitcoin. If the then current carrying value of a digital asset exceeds the fair value so determined, an impairment loss has occurred with respect to those digital assets in the amount equal to the difference between their carrying values and the price determined.Impairment losses are recognized within Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the impairment is identified. The impaired digital assets are written down to their fair value at the time of impairment and this new cost basis will not be adjusted upward for any subsequent increase in fair value. Gains are not recorded until realized upon sale(s), at which point they are presented net of any impairment losses for the same digital assets held within Restructuring and other. In determining the gain to be recognized upon sale, we calculate the difference between the sales price and carrying value of the digital assets sold immediately prior to sale.""",0.9976

Their PE is 1,628 and this is not a fully diluted PE. Multiply the two and the total is 814 million cars. Fully diluted and this number nears 900 million. There is not enough raw material capacity to achieve this in the next 10 years. World auto production in 2019 was 91,786,861.

He said that lifespan is standard for infotainment systems in the industry.""While the wear rate is heavily influenced by the active use of the center display system, even more so when the vehicle is in drive or charging, given a reasonable average daily use of 1.4 cycles, the expected life would be 5-6 years,"" Prescott said.

5230,"Tesla Recall Email (Full Text):""In order to ensure your safety, Tesla will proactively retrofit a power steering component in all Model S vehicles built before April 2016. (No other Tesla vehicles are affected.) There have been no injuries or accidents due to this component, despite accumulating more than a billion miles of driving.To be clear, this recall does not apply to any Model X or Model 3 vehicles, only to Model S vehicles built before April 2016.We have observed excessive corrosion in the power steering bolts, though only in very cold climates, particularly those that frequently use calcium or magnesium road salts, rather than sodium chloride (table salt). Nonetheless, Tesla plans to replace all early Model S power steering bolts in all climates worldwide to account for the possibility that the vehicle may later be used in a highly corrosive environment.If the bolts fail, the driver is still able to steer the car, but increased force is required due to loss or reduction of power assist. This primarily makes the car harder to drive at low speeds and for parallel parking, but does not materially affect control at high speed, where only small steering wheel force is needed.Our records show that you own a Model S affected by this voluntary recall. At this time there is no immediate action you need to take and you may continue to drive your Model S. Tesla will contact you to schedule an appointment when parts are available in your region. The retrofit will typically take around an hour.Thank you for being a Tesla customer, and we apologize for this inconvenience. If you have any questions, please contact us by phone at 844-248-3752 or by email at ServiceHelpNA@tesla.com.""Commentary: We know the recall involves replacing 3 bolts. The cost will be ~ $1/car. They say the recall takes an hour. In reality that is 30 minutes of a repair tech's time ($25) and 30 minutes of useless waiting around while they wash your car and give you coffee. ($10). (all numbers pulled out of my tush, but you get the idea) $36/car * 123k cars = $4.4M for the whole affair. If the bolts didn't meet Tesla's spec much of that will be eaten by the vendor.

For you clueless cult members, that means the $3 billion spent on capex in 2020 is not deducted from revenues on the income statement, so it has little immediate bearing on tesla's bottom line.Capital expenditures like equipment and new plants are put on the balance sheet and depreciated over years. For you clueless cult members, that means only a small fraction is deducted on the income statement. Depending on the asset and current tax rules (like during pandemics when the government might encourage capex or not) it may take 5 to 39 years to deduct the cap ex.If you look at tesla's cash flow statement in the Q3 10Q it shows about $1.7 billion in depreciation over the 9 months. That's an accumulaiton of deductions over its entire life of buying assets. For the qtr that would be depreciation of about $500 million.Ford shows over $7 billion for the first 9 months or $2.33 billion per qtr.

Here’s why they believe $NIO could reach a valuation of $300 billion: What it does:NIO designs and jointly manufactures smart, high performance, premium connected electric vehicles. Why we own it:- An emerging, uniquely Chinese brand champion that aspires to completely reimagine the experience of car ownership and shape a community of 'joyful users' with premium member services offered through NIO House and NIO Life.- A vast market opportunity, China accounts for 60% of incremental EV sales globally with huge pent-up demand given the chances of citizens obtaining a licence plate for a non-EV in e.g. Beijing are 1-in-800. Nor is the market limited to China.- An aspiring founder who naturally thinks in a long time frame and invests personally in his distinctive vision.- An attractive business model. THere is considerable space capacity in the Chinese automotive industry and NIO is happy to outsource the manufacture of its product to high-quality partners while retaining control of key intellectual property. How it could be worth many times more:- Over ten years, 1m premium vehicles a year (RMB400bn), licencing IP to a further 1m (at least RMB40bn) and an affluent community of 5-10m embrace.- NIO Life ancillary offerings (clothing, clubhouses, entertainment) at RMB30k each p.a. (RMB200bn+).- Margins are 2x traditional premium vehicles (20%) giving a post-tax cash flow of ~100bn RMB and valuation of $300bn Short 10 Questions: 1.) Can sales double in the next five years?Just the fothills. Progress toward 0.5m cars per year and approaching 1m members cumulatively. 2.) Ten years and beyond?Mass-market IP licencing, premium memberships, autonomy. Joint ventures with Changan and GAC capable of 2m cars per year (1/3rd of market)? Level 4 autonomy to be commonplace in China before the West? 3.) Competitive advantage?Deep connection with its member community. Aspiration brand and lifestyle choices. Technology. 4.) Is the business culture different?Yes. Bringing joy to customers through design, value, community, exceeding expectations, honesty. 5.) Customers like you? Contribute to society?So far, emphatically yes. Demand has been greater (and broader) than even the company expected. 6.) Are returns worthwhile?Not at the moment. Still investing heavily behind the vision. 7.) Will they rise or fall?If NIO becomes primarily an IP licensor with low manufacturing investment, returns could rise steeply. 8.) How is capital allocated?Technology (Primarily software), R&D and expanding the NIO House network. 9.) Could it be worth 5x as much?100m affluent customers by 2020. Car ownership per capita 3x lower than most developed economies. 10.) WHAT DOESN'T THE MARKET UNDERSTAND?Lazy anologies to Tesla (the visions differ) combined with fearfulness at the short-term capital needs.",0.9984

5382,"There has been a lot of hope and hype about growth for Tesla, but I suspect that a lot of it is misplaced. We now know that almost their entire growth last year was around China. Their sales in Europe were down for the year, and outside of China, any growth was modest or a result of entering a new market.The problem is that much of that growth has been (continually) at the expense of reputation, with consumers and regulatory bodies. The quality of their cars has come into question in Europe (see Netherlands taxi cab story), In the US (see stories about recalls in US) and now China (see stories about Tesla risks wearing out welcome in China). Now there are even reports that highlight the (long known) fact that Tesla has been hyping their range. Now there is serious competition and it is growing rapidly just as the 'wow' factor for Tesla is wearing off. What will be interesting to watch is when the same 'wow' factor wears off on the share price. Of course a move from $900 to $800 isn't really a sign of that yet, but a break down to $600 or $500 would be a pretty serious outcome.The lack of profits and declining margins on growing sales was a warning shot. When sales start to stabilize and profits still don't show up, well, investors may take notice. (And when I say investors, I don't mean day traders and swing traders. I mean investors who are buying into the idea that Tesla has some sort of magic battery or secret cool factor.These things only last so long . . . In Europe's top markets, Tesla had 10% share last quarter, and while the data for this quarter is way, way too early, Tesla currently makes up just 2.5% of the market. No one company has to be better than Tesla when 9 out of every 10 EVs is sold by other companies. The number of models (and companies) is growing rapidly and Tesla laid the foundation for that sea change.Good luck with your decisions, but the bloom may be off the rose.Guru.",0.9965

5465,"To show how overvalued Tesla is (and yes they are a great company with a visionary leader) let’s compare this to the biggest company in the world, Apple (who also had a visionary leader in Steve Jobs). In 07, Apple released their first touchscreen iPhone. They climbed to a market cap of 175B, while making close to 35B in revenue. Their P/E ratio at that time was less than 40 and they were trading around 6x sales. Fast forward to 9/2012, Apple reached a market cap of 650B (after 5 whole years and before crashing down to 365B) while making 156B in revenue with a p/e of about 12. In comparison, Tesla is expected to close out this year on 31B of revenue, while it has a market cap of close to 850B, trading close to 30x sales and has a p/e close to 1700!! This makes Tesla 5x (500%) more overvalued than what the biggest company in the world was when they released their most innovative product. Then, everything else that’s going on with the economy. People losing their jobs (unemployment at historic highs), small businesses closing left and right and last week they were expecting 70k jobs to get added to payroll, but instead 120k jobs were reduced. I get the market is forward looking but it must be looking 2+ years ahead these days and for Tesla, 5+ years ahead. Yes this will likely be a 1T+ company and bigger down the road, but with 100% certainty, they are wayyyy too ahead of their time. A crash is certain (for the whole market) but who knows when. I’ll stay on the sidelines in the meanwhile. The only thing driving this crazy market (especially this stock) is fear of inflation, FOMO and stimulus (not fundamentals). Just look at all of FAANG stocks and compare historic P/E ratios to this year.

5491,"The inventory issue will be the final nail in the financial coffin. Let’s examine the 114 X/S sitting in inventory in Canada. Right now they are Finished Goods on the Tesla Balance Sheet as at end of Q3.., now, it is highly probable that Tesla will have to offer significant discounts to move that inventory.Remember, this is a company desperate to raise cash due to pending debt obligations. Having a $130k cdn car ( $100k Usd) sitting in some parking lot in Canada does nothing to raise cash. Rather, they drop the price through discounts to monetize the car and raise cash, but take a loss on the car ( Hurts GAAP earnings)The Balance Sheet is overstated... the inventory is too high and only way to move cars quickly is to incent people. Tax credits are gone ( Ontario) or are dropping off quickly due to Tesla hitting 200K mark for US tax credits.., a perfect storm against Tesla profits.I would really appreciate others on this thread going out to their local Tesla store, look at Model 3 and S/X inventory available through the sales reps Tesla system ( just say you want a car within 2 weeks or so.. they’ll show you inventory)Also, I plan to keep watching for the first October production Model 3 to land in Toronto. Then, by asking enough customers when they ordered the Model 3, we can get a sense of whether Tesla is still filling backlog, or now filling very short term orders.Once I see only September or October orders being delivered, I know backlog is exhausted, then, by counting new deliveries per week we get a good sense of ongoing Model 3 demand. My intuition and the fact there are 33 inventory Model 3s in Toronto available for sale ( I could have one in 5 business days if I found one that I liked the combo of FWD/AWD, colour and wheels, I could have it by next Friday! ). That means either:1. Previous customers have walked away from their orders ( probably due to loss of Ontario tax credits)2. Tesla is keeping production numbers > actual demand and building inventory.., most people look at weekly production numbers and ASSUME that means that is equal to actual demand... what if Tesla now building cars in excess of actual orders ( like most car companies do).., big difference is Tesla does not have financial strength to play the inventory holding game!!!! Anyway, Canada and Toronto does not tell the whole picture. Dallas was a partial corroboration of my findings. If others can gather info from their local Tesla store ( take an hour or two o time), a bigger picture will emerge.I am a short via Puts. But I gather real data to confirm or refute my thesis.

5513,"Congrats to all the Tesla stock owners who have gotten rich off the stock. Sadly I was way too late to the game. To those future owners who are going to get destroyed when this stock collapses, I offer my condolences to you ahead of time. Everyone one of you knows that you can not make a rational, logical reason why Tesla should be above $300. Even $200 is stretching it. Though Tesla is the main game in town if you want an EV today, in 5 years that will not be the case. Consumers will have dozens and dozens of alternative models from Europe, Asia, and the US to choose from that fit their tastes. Even if Tesla remains the number 1 brand for EV, the odds of it taking more than even 20% of the market share is small. So ride the wave up but be careful. I admit these levels make me too scared even to entertain buying Tesla. Sure it might go up $1000 more in the next 6 months. The house could collapse in a few months down to $400.

The electrical distribution system was not designed for this and it hasn’t been a problem so far. The transformers and wires were sized using something called a “diversity factor” - an assumption that not everyone would be using full power at the same time. Go take a look outside your house if you live in a city/subdivision and have an overhead power line supplying your street. If the secondary (low voltage) wires are the size of an extension cord and there is a 50kVA transformer feeding 10+ houses, then the infrastructure is not sufficient to support widespread EV use at your local level.

To balance their losses, they have had to close their long time positions like those ones on Tesla, bringing down the price. But this is only a drop in the ocean. Tesla is strong and will only need a few hours, if not days to climb back up, and remain even tougher than before. ""Deceiving"" earnings won't bring it down, Tesla is still a leader, has massive market shares in batteries, and, because no one is talking about it, just introduced the new model S and X. Those new cars are not only better looking (inside and outside), they also have longer range (from 628km to 840km autonomy for the higher version), a top speed of 320km/h for the Model S Plaid +, and 0-100 in just 2.1 seconds.

And unlike previous years, there has been no letting him off the hook to deflect away from delivering on the M3.

5870,"Tesla’s share of the critical European battery-electric-vehicle market crumbled in the first month of 2021, and China has taken the top spot from Europe in the EV race, according to new research.Tesla’s trajectory in Europe is in decline. The U.S. car maker delivered 1,619 battery-electric vehicles to 18 key European markets in January, representing 3.5% of all battery-electric vehicles registered that month, according to a report based on public data by automotive analyst Matthias Schmidt. In 2020, Tesla delivered 1,977 vehicles in January — more than a 5% market share.Schmidt called Tesla’s January performance “consistently low,” noting that the company’s European delivery schedule sees volumes peak at the end of each quarter. However, the analyst noted that Tesla’s 12-month rolling volumes have now fallen behind Hyundai and Kia, which are now the third-most popular EV group in Europe.The tide turned for Tesla in 2020, with Tesla dropping behind both the brands of Volkswagen Group and the alliance between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi.Last year, Tesla made up just 13% of the European market despite a smaller proportional decline in the number of vehicles it delivered — around 10%.More broadly in January, China raced past Europe to reclaim its crown as the world’s largest market for electric vehicles. There were 179,000 battery-electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles registered in China in January, compared with 110,000 in Europe. The boost in China comes after a standout year for Europe. There were 1.33 million electric-vehicle registrations in Europe in 2020, topping 1.25 million in China, amid a pedal-to-the-metal push to increase EV adoption from European governments and supercharged demand from consumers.China is home to a strong domestic electric-vehicle sector, including manufacturers Nio, Xpeng and BYD.Schmidt’s report shows that Volkswagen Group, which manufactures VW, Audi, Skoda, Seat, and Porsche, remains the most popular battery-electric vehicle group in Europe, with more than 22% of the market share after delivering 10,193 vehicles.It is closely followed by Stellantis , a group formed earlier this year through the merger of PSA — which included Peugeot and Citroën — and Fiat Chrysler. Stellantis delivered 9,005 vehicles.Behind Stellantis is Hyundai and Kia, increasingly popular in Europe, which delivered more than 7,087 vehicles. That puts the Korean group ahead of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, which delivered 6,018 cars, though Renault’s Zoe remained the most popular battery-electric vehicle in Europe in January.Then comes Mercedes-owner Daimler, BMW, and Volvo, which all delivered more battery-electric vehicles than Tesla in the first month of the year.Germany remained the single largest market within Europe for electric vehicles. The 16,315 battery-electric vehicles registered in the country in January were more than the totals of the next-two largest markets, France and the U.K., combined.",0.9698

5895,"Lots of NIO shareholders come to $LI and $XPEV trying to convince people to sell LI and XPEV and buy NIO as if the entire market use yahoo commenting system.But let's get past the hype that seems to blow NIO shareholders minds. NIO in the presentation said that they'll use Nvidia's chip and another company's battery to make their cars even better than Tesla's cars. They avoided saying who created the battery but the battery company is Qing Tao and was confirmed at Qing Tao. At first glance it sounds great. But adopting Nvidia's chip and another manufacturer's battery means that NIO didn't produce any of these tech in-house and have no way to prevent every EV company out there from also adopting Nvidia's chip and Qing Tao's battery.Another concern is Qing Tao, up to this point, has not been able to declare that their battery works on vehicle yet. One analyst quote, ""Chinese startup Qing Tao Energy Development says it’s created the first solid-state battery production line in China, with one big caveat: Its batteries don’t work with electric vehicles (yet).""Another analyst quoted, ""Right now, they are using the batteries for “special equipment and high-end digital products”, but Nan says that they are talking to “a number of large automobile manufacturers” about using their solid-state batteries in electric vehicles.""One analyst went on to comment about the presentation, ""In this statement, NIO’s CEO William Li, didn’t choose his words carefully, he didn’t say NIO is making.. but rather NIO adopts.. This definitely indicates that NIO is simply buying the battery from a supplier (likely CATL), rather than making their own. If this is true, then the timeline of Q4 2022 for delivery of the first Solid State Battery in a car, will be heavily exposed to delays by the 3rd party.""This presentation from NIO day is a great bullish news for Nvidia. Not so much for Nio. As for other company Qing Tao, well they might never be able to release their product at all 2 years from now. Remember $QS said that they had a breakthrough and they can't release their product until 2024 at the earliest? It's not easy, and I would pick QuantumScape over Qing Tao any day.I understand NIO shareholders want to think NIO is the next $TSLA, but let's be clear. NIO is no TSLA. Not even close. TLSA would create its own chip and its own battery. That's how it prevents other EV companies from also using them.",0.9989

6082,"Many try to diminish the importance of Norway's sales data, but I think that is a mistake. Here are some data and insights.Norway has about 5.3MM people in totalThey have about 2.8MM passenger cars registered.To date Norwegians have purchased about 372,041 EVs (about 13%)This makes Norway, the biggest adopter of EVs in the world. There is a strong argument to be made that this little country is a useful model for what might happen in other countries as EVs are adopted competition increases.To date, Tesla has sold 58,915 of all EVs sold including:111 Roadsters13,829 Model X21,120 Model S23,855 Model 3Its worth noting that the bulk of sales happened before there was any significant competition. If you take out the Model S/X sales, Tesla's sales are mediocre at best, and in the last two years, they sold less than 2,000 model S in Norway and 3,000 Model X. Put another way, now that there is choice, those vehicles don't make the grade for the vast majority of buyers. (As an aside Porsche sold 1,200 Taycan's just last year at almost double the price!)Tesla has 15.8% of the EVs sold in the country over that three year period.Now you can massage the numbers anyway you want, but here are some conclusions from my analysis you can look at EU-EVs to see some nice graphs:1. The number of competitors has jump significantly. In 2018, six auto groups represented over 95% of sales. In Q4 2020, those same six groups represented just 80%. Renault was the largest in Q1 2018 at 40%, now it is VW by a large margin at 29.2%, Tesla maxed out at 29% in Q1 2019, they are currently (Q4 2020) at 16.3%2. Nissan and Tesla were both beneficiaries of early adoption. Now the field is spread very widely in a 'normal' market where there is competition and Tesla has moved to third place in marketshare in Norway in 2020 behind VW, Hyundai and Renault/Nissan. VW is the only company to show dominance.3. The idea of domination is probably passed. Tesla can claim such a thing in the USA, VW can in Europe but other than that, there is broad adoption or such small numbers as to be a misnomer. In Norway, VW brands clearly dominate having gone from 16%, 25% and now 30% marketshare over the past three years. Tesla went from 18% to 30% to 11%. 4. Finally there are a lot of arguments about capacity and those have yet to be borne out for any manufacturer in any meaningful way. Competition is ramping up everywhere, and all suppliers appear to be constrained by supply. That data will become clearer this year and next when substantially more production comes online.Overall though the reason that Norway is important is because it is a small window into the future of EV sales and competitive markets.You can ignore it. You can misrepresent it, you can acknowledge it, but it is still happening and it isn't favorable for Tesla.Guru.",0.9959

After the latest fundraising, SpaceX is valued at $74 billion, according to CNBC.The latest raise values SpaceX 60% higher compared with the previous round in August when it raised nearly $2 billion at a valuation of $46 billion.Why It Matters: Notably, the funds were raised just one cent shy of $420, an infamous figure that caused plenty of trouble for Musk in 2018. In December, it was reported that SpaceX was seeking a valuation of $92 billion in a new funding round.The company plans to send four space tourists to orbit Earth on “the world’s first all-civilian mission” during the fourth quarter this year.Related Link: Elon Musk Unintentionally Sends 'Marscoin' Cryptocurrency Soaring 1,800% With A Tweet",0.9797

Prices are several notches higher for foreign marques, - Mercedes-Benz EQC going at 499,800 yuan- BMW’s iX3 retails for 469,900 yuan.I think the biggest competition to Telsa, Xpeng, Nio and Li Auto is the PRC traditional auto manufactures as BAIC, SAIC, Geely and BYD for example. I am personally and professionally bullish about the PRC EV market and think 8 - 10 companies will dominate like Telsa, Nio, Xpeng, Li, WM, BAIC, SAIC, Geely and BYD and then there will be least expensive (but not that profitable) and the top end luxury foreign JVs like Mercedes, VW doing well too to make up about 12-15 companies leading EV in PRC.For Nio, Xpeng, Li and WM, they will continue to do very well and have significant upside both in business and stock valuations.",0.9768

You don't slash prices, lay off employees on 3 separate occasions, close stores, and move cars to Europe where you have lower margins if there is demand in North America. Tesla barely made a profit last quarter selling 90,000 cars. Imagine how bad Tesla will miss making a profit moving these lower margin models overseas were transportation costs and other costs will be much higher than in the US. Model 3 has cannibalized Model S and X sales and pre-orders for Model Y are under 12k hence the reason the ""expensive"" referral program is back. Musk has mortgaged his properties and his plane for personal liquidity. This is just another stock pump and his all-in moment.

After a climax run, comes a BIG pullback.P/E ratio- all time highP/S ratio- all time highRSI- off by one point from 2013 all time highTesla expected to make 31B in revenue but has a 800B market cap!! If anyone can find any other stock that has ever done this in the history of stocks (tech, auto, whatever) please give me the name. Apple disrupted the cell phone market when they developed the first touch screen iPhone (35B in revenue at the time - 175B market cap), Amazon disrupting brick and mortar business (amongst all other things)(had a 3600 p/e at one point but were making 55-60B in revenue and had a ~150B market cap), Google- I’m sure you’ve heard of them (highest p/e they ever had was around mid 50s), Netflix disrupting streaming business (traded at a about 450 P/E at their highest, while making close to 4B in revenue and had a 45B market cap- highest PS ratio of about 12). So just compare Tesla to any other major tech company and you’ll see the insane overvaluation here (even though as it stands Tesla makes most of their money from selling cars!). Up close to 900% since March. People need to get a close look and see that numbers like that can only be compared to .com bubble. Welcome to the EV bubble. You have companies like NKLA with no revenue valued close to 10B. There’s a new EV company every other day and competition is EVERYWHERE. Tesla could sit at this price for the next 3-5 (or more) years and still be grossly overvalued.Reality is Tesla is expected to make 31B this year, 45B next year and 65B in 2023. With this growth, fair value they should be around 300-400B market cap and that’s still being very generous. Don’t worry, there was plenty of blind FOMO buyers in the .com bubble as well. They would speak the same language as the pumpers here. Keep in mind that it took investors 10-15 years to make their money back (and that’s if they invested in amazon). Looks like history will repeat itself. This coming earnings report should do the job! Y’all better hope they smash expectations by at least 100%! Since they barely met 2020 delivery expectations, I expect a modest beat at best, then let the massive selling begin (sell the news)!Leaving off with this.

I wonder if NNDM will go into the new ARK space fund? It is required for making guidance systems. The recent direct offering at $12.80 is also a floor. Whoever bought that offering will also be buying in the open market below $12.80. I also like TSLA, but at $500, not $750. However the 200 dma is $450 and rising quickly, so I may be too pessimistic. I like TSLA because their competition is ICE manufactures, not other BEVs. There is a shortage of batteries. TSLA is also the leader in self driving. Self driving is all about data collection and artificial intelligence. TSLA collects 100 times more data than their nearest competitor.

That would be truly impressive, especially after 2023 with all the competition from other car manufacturers. If share count doesn't change, that would suggest GAAP earnings in 2026 of $8/share. Again, that would be very impressive growth of 11 times 2020 earnings.That would put TSLA's earnings just about where GM's are expected to be in 2026 (which is only about 25% more than expected 2021 GM earnings). Yet, TSLA is trading at 15 the times of the price of GM.BTW, I am long GM. I ""expect"" that if GM performs as I project, it will be worth as much as $100/share in 2026. But, I wouldn't be willing to pay $100 per share for GM NOW.Can you see the problem we have with this? Yes, growth is good. 6 years of 50% per year would be possible only in the absence of any sort of significant competition. Maybe it's possible for 6 years. I think it's highly unlikely. But even then, with TSLA selling over 5 million cars per year at current vehicle prices, it would have to grow more than 10 times from that to justify the current stock price. (More likely it would have to sell more than 10 million per year if it is selling a $25k vehicle).This just doesn't seem like an expectation that a reasonable man could have. It's as if you have concluded that Elon Musk can walk on water (not frozen) and therefore TSLA is worth $1000/share, $5000/share, $15,000 per share or whatever.It just doesn't make any sense.",0.9925

Doble Steam Motors Company. The first model E was sold in 1924, and Doble Steam Motors continued to manufacture steam-powered cars for the next seven years. In 1924 the State of California learned that Abner had helped to sell stock illegally in a desperate bid to raise money for the company, and though Abner was eventually acquitted on a technicality, the company folded during the ensuing legal struggle.For all their innovations, Doble [change name to Tesla] cars were hindered by two significant problems. The first was the price: the chassis alone sold for $9500, and adding a body virtually doubled that figure, making the car a luxury item in the 1920s. In 1922 the brothers had begun work on a lower cost model, projected to sell for less than $2000. This was named the Simplex, and was to be powered by four uniflow single-acting cylinders. One prototype is known to have been constructed, but the car never approached production stage. The other problem was Abner Doble himself, who was said to be such a perfectionist that he was seldom willing to stop tinkering and actually release an automobile for sale. http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a6228/jay-leno-and-his-doble-steam-cars/",0.8339

6848,"I'd love to share some thoughts on TSLA as I'm a money manager and a long time trader (yes both buy and sell) of the stock. Im not going to offer advice just give some clarity b/c as always it seems this message board is all over the place.Today's drop in share price is NOTHING to be concerned about. The security (TSLA) is acting just as anyone who is knowledgable would tell you. It had a TREMENDOUS run up over the past couple of weeks and some (not anywhere near all) people who held onto this are taking gains. This does NOT mean this is the beginning of the apocalypse and anyone who is reading that should be warned it's probably shorts who are littering this board. Yes, NIO is very attractive and will continue to grow. But TSLA is not just about selling cars as many of those EV companies are. They also rake profits on a SaaS platform whereby anyone using their open source for their batteries and internal displays need to utilize. So, essentially in many cases the more EV cars on the road, the better it is for TSLA.As for news....if you don't think there is anyone BIG news upcoming then you just don't know TSLA. I have had the opportunity to speak with Elon Musk in the past and in that ONE conversation he said that he prides himself on being able to move the stock price through a series of ""events"", some of which have been tweets obviously. Well, in about a week or so, you will be getting the ""deliveries"" for 2020 which will be announced BEFORE earnings report, which is due at the end of January. I'm 99% certain they blow past the 500K benchmark set forth and this will take the share price close to if not exceeding $700. Of course, weeks later, there is the Earnings Report which, if some other posters talking about option activity sinking the share price, will end up being a catalyst soon thereafter.All this to say stick to your guns with TSLA. If you're NOT a trader, then don't try to do it. Shorts have lost an exorbitant amount of money and if you think truly that the S&P is going to ""allow"" or ""permit"" a company to join that will tank and take the index with it, then you're just plain foolish.Hope this helps...",0.9979

6891,"In response to a large number of requests for my take of the monday eve ""ELON TWEET""------ I offer the following:.First a disclosure, though a longtime holder of TSLA , , and one who has grown to acknowledge the genius ability of Elon Musk, I don't worship him. He is brilliant, talented, CUNNING, cruel, and not a very nice person, certainly not a sterling example of transparent honesty. He has had to wage war with ""the shorts "" and industry enemies who sought to destroy TSLA and for many years had the upper hand, but in the last year he has turned that around in a big way. So while I don't worship him as many do, I certainly have a deep respect for his warrior ability. I see his tweet as just the latest chapter in the story of the ""war"". He certainly does not intend to sink the stock, but rather to walk the fine line he perceives in the best interest of the company that is his baby and his source for riches.. A number of things come to mind, we know that many people around the world want to buy a TSLA, many would wait if a new technology was imminent . He cannot have that, he wants and needs current sales to be robust. On the other hand, he also needs to keep good news flowing to support the lofty shareprice. I am convinced he has that news, we will learn some of it today, there will be more in the future, he will walk the fine line as he sees fit. Those who short TSLA , especially on weakness , should bear in mind and take very seriously his formidable warrior abilities. I, for one , I am not dismayed about the tweet, it is classic, typical Elon. There is more reasons I can think of for the tweet, but for now the above will suffice.The above being said, those of you who have followed my posts, know that I anticipate much more reasonable share price action than the extremists on the board. The extreme pumpers who spoke of $600 and more this week NEVER were going to be right. Those who think the stock will be at $1000 by year end are also wrong. I also believe the extremist bashers will continue to be wrong It is going to be interesting , that is always true for TSLA .................Less",0.9978

Still a frothy value. I think people are going to play both sma lines for a day trade. It's just too bad cathie wood got caught with her hand in the cookie jar.

Even if Tesla develops meaningful ancillary profit streams over time (e.g., recurring services revenue, battery sales to other automakers, an autonomous ride-hailing network, etc.), the company would probably need to grow sales to at least 10 million vehicles annually to justify its current valuation.

Even if Tesla just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem.

Most of them have never made a profit and the stocks have been soaring. Is this what the TSLA fans think TSLA is about? The beauty of the ""software as a service in the cloud"" model is that most of the costs (developing the software) is fixed regardless of the number of customers. Client acquisition is also a big expense, but, there there are large economies of scale and the dominant player is at a great advantage. Gross margins and operating margins are huge.But, despite all the protests that TSLA isn't just a car company, the fact is that nearly all its revenues comes from selling cars (or EV credits) and it is really just a car company. Growth will not greatly improve margins. You are not going to find buyers of a $25,000 car paying $10,000 for a self driving software package.

The market always overdoes it when there is technological change creating a new product. There will end up being excess capacity and all the EV makers will be fighting for market share and profits will be meager at best. At least 1/2 of them will end up in bankruptcy.

7453,"Observations about @elonmusk's $420 LBO announcement:First, the context is odd: Musk promised on the conference call that $TSLA will be forever profitable. So why does he need to go private to ""end negative propaganda from shorts""? And why let them off the hook at $420?Musk suggests there will be no controlling shareholder in the LBO. He also says financing is already arranged. Ergo, he implies a syndicate of lenders has already signed documents for the deal. This is odd for two reasons...First, Musk recently rebuffed an investment offer from Saudi Arabia. If you're passing the hat for the largest LBO syndicate in history, why say no to a big check?Second, a $70B syndicate would involve numerous banks, dozens of lawyers, and multiple boards of directors. It's been [over] 12 hours since the announcement, and none of these parties has confirmed Musk's claims.Which raises a general point: a $70B dollar deal is a Jupiter-sized briar patch of legal and regulatory rules. It's a minutely choreographed thing, with legal risk for any party that says or does the wrong thing at the wrong time. With that in mind:Why did $TSLA not request a trading halt until an hour after Musk's tweet? Why did the company belatedly post an email from Musk, rather than an official statement? Why did Tesla not file an 8-K disclosing details of the purported LBO?Musk says he will not sell in the deal. What about his ~$800M in margin loans? Will lenders accept illiquid collateral?

And Wall Street is driving down Tesla stock -40% from its recent high because it's a ... car company? Hmm, confusing. But not really. All of that just proves Wall Street finally believes the indisputable global EV leader Tesla is actually a tech company that just so happens to make cars. So when the short-term shortie dopes on this discussion board cluelessly claim Tesla is only a car company that should be valued as such, just ask them: Given that Wall Street is now temporarily shifting some money to cyclicals (e.g., car companies), and if Tesla is only a ""car company,"" then why has Wall Street put Tesla in reverse price-wise while rising the stock price of the cyclical antiquated ICE car companies? [Cricket sounds ... ] There's your answer: Even the hopelessly clueless Wall Street finally figured out Tesla is a tech company that happens to make cars. All of Tesla's so-called ""competitors"" don't have the foggiest clue how to catch up to the innovative global EV leader Tesla which is many, many years ahead of all the ICE-makers. Just imagine the next few years: Each antiquated ICE gas-guzzling automaker may come up with some half#$%$ EV that sells maybe 25k or 50k units a few years from now. All the antiquated ICE companies will have tons of growing pains with their half#$%$ EV joint-ventures. Why would anyone want to spend their hard-earned money on some antiquated ICE gas-guzzling manufacturer's first shaky attempts at an EV when Tesla's been designing and manufacturing EVs for 21 years? Answer: They wouldn't. The great thing about the antiquated ICE automakers' announced attempts at EVs is that it's now bringing huge global attention to EVs. That's more free advertising for EVs. And when the world thinks ""EVs,"" it instantly thinks Tesla. And when the world thinks Tesla, it thinks ""EVs."" This is all going tremendously in Tesla's favor. If you ask Elon, he's loving this.

7689,"Observations about @elonmusk's $420 LBO announcement:First, the context is odd: Musk promised on the conference call that $TSLA will be forever profitable. So why does he need to go private to ""end negative propaganda from shorts""? And why let them off the hook at $420?Musk suggests there will be no controlling shareholder in the LBO. He also says financing is already arranged. Ergo, he implies a syndicate of lenders has already signed documents for the deal. This is odd for two reasons...First, Musk recently rebuffed an investment offer from Saudi Arabia. If you're passing the hat for the largest LBO syndicate in history, why say no to a big check?Second, a $70B syndicate would involve numerous banks, dozens of lawyers, and multiple boards of directors. It's been [over] 12 hours since the announcement, and none of these parties has confirmed Musk's claims.Which raises a general point: a $70B dollar deal is a Jupiter-sized briar patch of legal and regulatory rules. It's a minutely choreographed thing, with legal risk for any party that says or does the wrong thing at the wrong time. With that in mind:Why did $TSLA not request a trading halt until an hour after Musk's tweet? Why did the company belatedly post an email from Musk, rather than an official statement? Why did Tesla not file an 8-K disclosing details of the purported LBO?Musk says he will not sell in the deal. What about his ~$800M in margin loans? Will lenders accept illiquid collateral? What about change of control provisions on $TSLA's debt? Who will fund the mandatory tender? Why did Musk's initial tweets portray this as a done deal, if his subsequent email revealed it to be merely his intention?Were these plans in the works when Musk publicly predicted a ""short burn of the century"" and a short squeeze larger than Volkswagen? Were they in the works when he aggressively purchased $TSLA shares in the premarket?If this deal is real, it won't be wrapped up for at least 6 months, and probably longer: a) need to assemble an independent board to vote on the deal (a court ruling this year decided that $TSLA's board is not independent of Musk), b) need a proxy statement with extensive risk disclosures (some think this is why $TSLA couldn't take the Saudi PIPE in the first place), c) need a shareholder vote, d) need antitrust review, even if perfunctory.Meanwhile, cash burn continues - in order to avoid default on their ABL, they must have cash/avail on Jan 1, 2019 sufficient to cover both 2019 convert maturities as well as a $400M buffer. That comes to $1.8B. At June they had $2.2B of cash and are burning close to $1B per quarter. Tough math.Musk says shareholders won't be forced to sell. How does that work? A private company with thousands of shareholders is still required to make SEC filings. How will unaccredited investors retain shares?The fact that none of these details was alluded to by Musk is further evidence that Musk has not discussed the deal with lawyers. Which brings us back to the question: how do you line up $70B in financing without involving a legal team?",0.9902

I am on my second (first was S, second is an X, both pre-owned) and have turned many friends on to it, and they all are as passionate as I am. It just drives way better, and is way safer and smarter and just BETTER. More and more chargers and superchargers are popping up so the charging issue is all but gone and soon gas stations will include charging stations as well. I charge mine using the 220V outlet for my dryer in the garage, works like a charm. Lost my free supercharging when I traded in the S for the X, but it's worth it, the X is just Ludicrous.And can I buy a Tesla in brown or green? No, will I be able to in the future? Probably. Can I buy a Tesla convertible? No, but someday I will. Can you buy a Tesla in New Orleans? Don't think so. Can you buy one in every state? No, but someday but you will be able to. Can I watch a Tesla commercial on t.v.? No, but would that increase sales and awareness? Maybe. Tesla in some ways is in it's adolesence, and I see the future as bright. Is the future bright for Tesla stock? I don't know.that All I know is that I'm guessing that at best, a small per centage of people that can afford a Tesla has driven one, meaning a huge per centage of people that can afford one has not driven one.The future is bright, even with the imminent competition.

So if they run out of orders for the high priced models and options prior to 3-6 months worth of at least 5k production of the higher end models will they be forced to start building and selling the lower priced models sooner than expected?

If Musk really have investors lined up to buy all the remaining shares of the stockholders that can't/won't keep their shares after going private at 420, why aren't they already loading up on the open market for a huge discount? Why would they wait and pay a huge premium at 420? Why didn't they jump in on Friday?This isn't a hostile take-over where Tesla is in a position to set the price. No, Musk is explicitly putting Tesla in the showroom and is desperately eager to go private.

Doubling that number in 2019 to over 100,000; also impressive, 200,000 in 2020 would be unprecedented. And all extremely do-able. The problem arises when Mr. Big Mouth starts throwing unsustainable exponential growth claims, then falls flat on his face. The story should be that Tesla is doubling Model 3 production year-to-year, not ""Tesla Fails to Meet Guidance, Again"" And all this is needlessly brought on by the extraordinary claims of a megalomaniac. Being good and successful is not enough, Elon needs to be ""special"".

I'll explain this again. - in Q3-2018 Tesla was selling lots of high end fully loaded Model 3s in the USA.Buyers got the full $7,500 tax credit. With a little help from ZEV credit sales they posted a profit.In Q4 2018 they had to offer lower end versions of the Model 3. The profit deteriorated.In Q1-2019 they ran out of high end buyers in the US and started shipping overseas.Tesla also cut prices across the board US tax credits were reduced by 50%. But they had to cut prices and offer cheaper version in China before they delivered a single unit there. For Q1-2019 they lost $700 million. Partly due to a large number of cars being in transit. But that does not account for the whole loss. Q2-2019 - Tesla cut prices again.They offered a lease for the Model 3. Leases are not sales, they are not usually lucrative. They then sweetened the lease and lower the payment to $399..They enhanced the Model S/X product. They even offered the base Model 3 ($35,000) for a few days. US tax credits are set to be cut again in July - that might help pull some sales forward. Tesla is offering free unlimited charging on a few cars.It's May and Tesla still have 2018 leftovers. Q3-2019 is going to be a bloodbath. The US tax credit will be only worth $1,875 Chinese buyers will have a compelling reason to wait for the much less expensive Domestically built Model 3s. Europe will have had 6 months of Model 3 sales, the motivated buying will have subsided, A trade war could mean more tariffs on American Made cars going to China. Suggestion: Forget the fluff (robo taxis) and watch the actual story unfold. Wait for real numbers like quarterly sales and the financial reports.

I belong to the latter, having shorted a share that has been one of the best performers in this century.Tesla Inc. is coming to the end of its first year selling China-made cars with a commanding position in the world’s biggest electric-vehicle market, but Elon Musk shouldn’t rest on his laurels.While Tesla regularly topped monthly premium EV sales tallies this year, helped by the sedans churned out from its multibillion-dollar plant opened to much fanfare in Shanghai last December, 2020 was also marked by rivals catching up. In 2021, the breadth of the competitive attack that Tesla faces will be greater than ever.Whether Tesla can defend its lead in China will be key to its wider growth and earnings trajectory. While still in its infancy, China’s electric-car market dwarfs that of other countries and the government is intent on further expansion amid commitments to reduce fossil-fuel use. Tesla’s fate in China will also show whether it can grow into a truly global carmaker, an ambition investors are banking on after pushing the company’s shares up almost 700% this year.Chinese automakers are notorious for building copycat cars that look just like the real thing but deliver underwhelming performance and quality.

If a big piece would go down, people would go in anxiety mode, everything would depend on how much You still believe. If You don't, You would die the momment this would go down a large piece. The momment when most people will stop believing in this, this stock will crash, but if people still believe in the ""Safe, high tech, zero emission future"" It won't crash. You have to understand that years and years younger generations been exposed to climate change, food additives, air pollution, and everything else to the point where everyone worries so much about their health, that believing in a Company like Tesla, all the news that Elon say's, how he say's takes away people minds out of years and years anxiety, Corona virus is a good thing for a company likes this too. People live in their own heads most of the time, worrying about everything, this company is like miracle for them. It's a problem soliution that they had for a long time, it's a wishfull thinking. Until Musk will say everything will be allright, people will believe that, because they had to. You want to believe that too. Another thing is Youtube, more and more people are sharing Musk and his companies news, so more people are getting into this everyday, it will grow little by little. As more people are getting exposed to what Musk and Tesla is. Memes are combined to reach out young audiences, as they are more likely to join Tesla becouse of the worries and fears they already have as I wrote prior to this. World is in ""Danger"" and Musk looks like the one who could ""Save"" everyone, even if he can't it doesn't matter, kids will be already exposed to this using memes. Musk is not stupid, everything he does is pure live advertising. The momment when he smoked weed, it's all about getting more and more people into this. Smoking weed looks a cool thing to younger audiences, as well as other pot smokers, they natturaly want to be a fallower as he looks like one of them. Everything about this company is more about human psychology, and emotions, not about numbers and revenue. Numbers do affect everything, but as long as this company just down fall by messing up something very bad, it will only go up. If you don't believe me, look up to a Elon Musk hall of fame video, watch it till the end, the way he ""Cares"" and almost cries, the way he messed up at the beggining of the journey with rockets, 3 fails, he spent his own money, and so on. Watch yourself, how do you feel after watching video like this? And imagine how a kid feels when he sees something like this. It's a dream, emotions that flow, he looks like real hero. Even if he is not, that I don't know, I can only assume he is a good gay. Anyway, I hope it may help someone to just to think how belief works, and what can it do.

I’m not sure why, but my hunch that Tesla ( the corporation) pays a fine is a tactical SEC decision that will bear fruit down the line.

8226,"Tesla was ordered by the Chinese government to shut down its Shanghai factory over concerns about the coronavirus, a closure that will delay Model 3 production and ultimately put slight downward pressure on profits in the first quarter, the automaker's finance chief Zach Kirkhorn said during an earnings call Wednesday.Prior to the call, Tesla reported Wednesday $105 million in net income, or 56 cents a diluted share, compared with $140 million, or 78 cents a share, in the same year-ago period. Tesla earned $386 million, or $2.14 a share, in the fourth quarter when adjusted for one-time items. Tesla generated revenue of $7.38 billion in fourth quarter, just 1% higher than the $7.2 billion generated in the same period in 2018.Model 3 production will be delayed by a week and a half, Kirkhorn said. Novel coronavirus, a new form of the family of viruses known as coronavirus first cropped up in Wuhan in late December 2019. Since then, thousands of people have contracted the virus, causing the government to take measures such as shutting down transit and factories throughout the country, including Foxconn. Automakers Ford and Toyota have said they will idle some of their Chinese assembly plants for an extra week, the NYT reported.""We are in the early stages of understanding if, and to what extent, we may be temporarily impacted by the coronavirus,"" Kirkhorn said. ""At this point we're expecting a one, to one and a half week-delay in the ramp of the Shanghai build Model 3 due to a government required factory shutdown. This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter, but is limited as the profit contribution from Model 3 Shanghai remains in the early stages.""Tesla is also closely monitoring if the coronavirus will cause interruptions in the supply chain for cars built in Fremont. ""So far we're not aware of anything material, but it's important to caveat, this is an unfolding story,"" Kirkhorn added.The first deliveries of Tesla Model 3 sedans produced at the Shanghai plant began in early January, one year after the U.S. automaker began construction on its first factory outside the United States.The deliveries to customers was a milestone for Tesla and a critical step for the company in its aim to carve out market share in the world’s biggest auto market, as well as lessen the financial pain caused by tariffs.",0.7805

This was primarily achieved through substantial growth in vehicle deliveries as well as growth in other parts of the business. At the same time, vehicle average selling price (ASP) declined by 11% YoY as our product mix continued to shift from Model S and Model X to the more affordable Model 3 and Model Y.ProfitabilityOur operating income improved in Q4 compared to the same period last year to $575M, resulting in a 5.4% operating margin. This profit level was reached while incurring SBC expense attributable to the 2018 CEO award of $267M in Q4, driven by an increase in our market capitalization and a new operational milestone becoming probable.Positive impact from volume growth and regulatory credit revenue growth YoY was mainly offset by lower ASP (including price reduction of China-made Model 3 and price reductions of Model S and Model X before the introduction of updated models) but also by a series of notable items. These included a portion of Q@4 SBC charges, vehicle warranty accruals, additional supply chain costs, Model S and Model X changeover costs and other items.CashQuarter-end cash and cash equivalents increased to $19.4B in Q4, driven mainly by our recent capital raise of $5.0B (average price of this offering was -$632/share) and free cash flow of $1.9B, partially offset by early debt repayments (early conversion of convertible notes).",0.9797

The share price is determined as an average of the closing prices for a specified number of trading days prior to the periodic purchase. A discount of 5% to the average market price is common. Dollar cost averaging results from the automatic and periodic purchases. A direct purchase plan is similar to a DRIP except the shareholder must make arrangements to automatically transfer money to the direct purchase plan.Setting up a direct purchase plan would establish a steady source of new capital flowing in from those who are most supportive of the company's goals - its current owners (shareholders).

8300,"The favorite narrative is that Musk is environment-friendly, and that EVs are ""zero-emission"", however, there's a largely untold (or dismissed) story about how unfriendly the mining of battery ingredients are for the environment as well as Tesla's choice of battery ingredients. With every decision there's a plus and a minus. And conveniently leaving these CO2 emissions out of the calculations are necessary to promote this false zero-emissions story. Moreover, The CO2 emissions from mining for these ingredients is a CO2 incursion not applicable to ICE vehicles. It's been told that the total construction of EVs (mining for battery ingredients included) coming off the assembly line (before having driven a mile) have emitted more CO2 emissions than a comparable ICE vehicle coming off the assembly line, and that it takes a number of years of comparable driving before the total CO2 emissions of an EV vehicle finally falls below that of an ICE vehicle (yes, of course, the burning of gas is highly CO2 emissive too). I'm sure there's other sources of CO2 emissions in the construction of an EV, but here's a few to consider: - High CO2 emissions from mining for Lithium - High CO2 emissions from mining for the extra 350% copper required for building an EV - High CO2 emissions from mining for other battery ingredients - the choice of Aluminum in batteries vs Manganese results in a higher risk of battery catching on fire, which is also highly CO2 emissive. Tesla cars catching on fire remains one of the most common complaints (including by Chinese consumers as recently as January 2021) - Choosing to leave Cobalt out of the battery, although it preserves a rare mineral and saves money, it also increases the chance of a battery fire, which, again, is a highly CO2 emissive event - Choosing to include Aluminum in Tesla batteries, though it results in higher range and increased risk of fires, it also results in a lower car lifespan, meaning Tesla owners will be either buying cars more frequently, or replacing the battery. Its been reported that 8 years is a rarely achieved lifespan for Tesla EV batteries, and replacing one not only costs @ $16,000 but it incurs another set of high CO2 emissions from building yet another battery.

Selling at the very peak of a climax top is essentially the great fishing story for investors. Many will claim it, few will achieve it.Investors may want to sell some Tesla stock into strength, because when a climax top occurs, shares can fall to earth even faster than they rise.After a climax run, stocks often suffer huge declines that take years to recover from. Qualcomm (QCOM) finally surpassed its 2000 climax top peak last year.Tesla stock had a climax-type run in late 2019 to early 2020, peaking on Feb. 4 at a split-adjusted 193.80. Shares then plunged 64% to 70.10 on March 18, with the coronavirus market crash no doubt contributing to the losses.Perhaps Tesla stock will have a climax top, sell off and rebound rather quickly once again. But do you want to sit through a 30%, 50%, 80% decline on hopes for a rebound? If Tesla stock corrects or crashes and then bounces back, investors can always buy it back. After the coronavirus crash, Tesla stock offered buying opportunities slightly below and above the February peak.",0.9709

Then it recovered for about 1/2 hour, then resumed falling more. That happened 2 or 3 times during the day and ended the day at the low, down almost 23%. I don't remember any major stock avoiding the fall that day. I was actually not surprised, because on the Oct 16, a program called Wall Street Week featured, among other guests, Marty Zwieg. He was a highly respected market analyst. Louis Rukeyser asked him about the market. That day, Friday Oct 16, the Dow had fallen about 100 points, almost 5%. HE said something slightly out of character ""I am worried........"". He was usually very careful not to be so direct. Rukeyser did not press him to elaborate. I think Louis knew full well Marty might be right on and a much lower market was very close. Little did they know the extent and sharpness of the fall the following Monday. I have never lost the impact of that market psychology leading up to that Monday. I now have a very similar sense for Monday, Oct 29, 2018. If not that day, then sometime during next week. That fall could be sudden and short lived like 1987 or it would be like Oct, 2008 when the steepest part of the fall lasted much of October. I seem to remember 2 or three days that month, the Dow fell about 1000 points during a day. I think the crash we will see next week will be more similar to 2008.",0.8749

Adding that he just weakened Tesla's ability to negotiate a strong buyout, Tesla almost needs to negotiate any kind of deal for a partial buyout now. Musk's only hope is that the Trump SEC is as dysfunctional as the rest of the government. This one is easy for the SEC to determine as Musk just revealed that the text was incorrect. If Tesla Board is smart, they will remove Musk from the daily management and start mitigating a very expensive error for the company.

The Trump is more desperate than ever to artificially fix markets...and Powell can't think straight either. This is the bloody streets that many waited for on the sidelines...bloodier than anyone expected. While many sectors have been impacted by the virus slowing down their businesses, consumers are spending less on smaller luxury purchases and just focusing on necessities. One necessity is still an automobile and anyone who was planning to get a new car, is still going to get a Tesla. Consumers that had a Model Y reserved are still going to take delivery on time....they're even going to likely get a better financing rate as well. So while there will a significant reduction in consumer wants-spending at malls, stores, and any other personal items that aren't a true need....I believe Teslas will keep rolling out of showrooms. And if you're one of the people that have a Tesla on order...investing in TSLA now will help pay for your Tesla. The key is to keep your mind focused on the long term rewards with TSLA and other tech stocks that took a hit. This is the biggest investment opportunity for anyone who's been waiting to invest in the stock market. I don't think the knuckleheads in DC can keep trying to control the market and someone may finally tell them to stop trying to help. Today may finally be the bottom. Everyone's at their wit's end. It's time to buy....everything is undervalued now and way oversold. Bull volume is going to come out ahead sooner than the skeptics want you to believe. The country has locked down in the past few days and the virus spread will slow now. If you're skeptical, invest in 10-25% chunks of your and slowly to your portfolio over a few days. Keep in mind...the outlook at $TSLA, $AMD, and many others has not changed at all....they are still focused on long term goals and companies have taken huge steps to keep their employees safe. Their products will continue to sell. Volatility is always temporary. Buy the bottom and keep holding. TSLA is still a $1500+ target for 2020.

But the fancy technology features VW had promised were either absent or broken. The company’s programmers hadn’t yet figured out how to update the car’s software remotely.

As a reminder to bulls, Musk said in 2016 that by 2020 we will be producing 1 million cars and and reality is barely making to half of that mark. It seems, all along Musk trying to burn shorts by setting these unattainable goals and giving false promises to investors of TSLA. Over last year or so, everyone on winning side (investors, traders) got used to this bubble but one day reality will hit and its gonna be bad. Research telling by 2024 there will be just 10% of car volume will be EV. And not that all will be tsla and there is some serious competition out there in that space. TSLA has few IP blocks which has kept them ahead in this tech sector - EV car, Autonomous driving software/hardware and battery technology. For each of this IP block there are some serious competitors and for me interesting thing is they have their own design/architecture and not just copying what TSLA doing. Typically competition copies leader and catch up with them sooner or letter (Example Intel, Irbot). But interestingly Tesla competitors surely gonna distinguish themselves. By 2024 or before that each IP block will be well developed, there will 2 to 3 decent options and it wont take long for companies like Toyota, Honda, GM, Ford (may be apple) to integrate and put some great product out there for consumers. To make matter worse for TSLA, car sales are going to be significantly down in coming few years (~30%). There are all kinds of projections which indicates 30% of population will never return to office work and that should directly impact car sales. So 10% of EV car volume by 2024 will be just 7% and out of 7% even is mush gets 70%, that will be just 5% of total EV cars for TSLA.

He said the guy had taken it to Tesla but they couldn't reproduce the problem. That doesn't pass the smell test.This is silicon valley. We get technology. An Apple engineer should be credible and able to work the system to report a serious malfunction like that. If I had that problem and they couldn't reproduce it, I'd mount a GoPro to document it and tell them I'll put the video on YouTube in two weeks, unless I get a call from a smart and curious Tesla engineer who is eager to get to the bottom of the problem.Also, Tesla has extensive logs and diagnostic info of how AP is used. Surely they could go back and capture the event in the logs if there was a malfunction like that. This accident occurred within 10 miles of Tesla HQ in Palo Alto. An Apple engineer who speaks that language would be *eager* to report an odd ball bug like that. Not only to get it fixed but to open doors and network.

The moron bragged about doubling his electrical service to save energy use.H'Yeah,... bizzarro.Now let's do some real ciphering on those numbers oil forgot the mention when he said his energy bill was $10/mt.Say you wanted to power a home 100% with solar panels and the average usage is 2000 kwh's per month. Using one of these solar panel sizing calculators, say in Texas (a relatively sunny state) it says you'd need at least a 15kW system. In less sunny states it would be much larger.If the average cost of a system is $3/kW, that's $45,000.If you were to finance the system for 20 years at 5% the payment would be about $300/mt.I know Texas is a deregulated state so you can get electricity off the grid anywhere from $0.04 to $0.10/kwh depending on how well you shop. Let's assume $0.07/kwh. At an average usage of 2000 kwh's, that's a monthly cost of $140/mt.That's less than half the payment for the ""free energy"".It gets worse.If you take the $45,000 and invest it in something that returns 5% per year (yours truly regularly gets 10 to 20%/yr out of it),.... That's $2250 per year or $187/mt.That would pay the electric bill (and dinner for 4 at the all you can eat Chinese buffet,... where the owner walks out after cabin boy and his date leboy have been there for a couple of hours and says - ""you go home now,.... you eat too much,.... you too beeg,... you eat all my flied lice,... you go home now.) and you'd still have your $45,000.Let's say you cut your energy usage in half and buy half the solar panels.

9125,"DETROIT (AP) — Tesla Inc. is balking at recalling about 159,000 vehicles with potentially defective touch screens, so U.S. safety regulators are moving to force the company to take action.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Wednesday sent a letter to Tesla saying it has tentatively determined that the screens are defective and pose a safety risk because they can cause backup cameras to go dark and defrosters to malfunction.The agency wouldn't comment beyond the letter, which is a rare step toward a public hearing and eventual legal action. Experts say the letter means that Tesla has resisted doing a recall that NHTSA feels is necessary.“It's obvious to me that Tesla told NHTSA to go pound sand, so what they're about to get, they've earned it,” said Frank Borris, a former head of the agency's Office of Defects Investigation who now runs a safety consulting business.Messages were left Wednesday seeking comment from Tesla, which is based in Palo Alto, California.Last June, the agency opened an investigation into complaints that the giant touch screens would go dark in certain 2012 through 2018 Model S cars and 2016 through 2018 Model X Tesla vehicles. It upgraded the probe to an engineering analysis in November.The letter says the agency has determined that the screens are defective because their computer processors have a finite number of program-and-erase cycles. NHTSA says the screens would fail in five to six years, which isn't sufficient for safety-critical features.“The lack of a functioning windshield defogging and defrosting system may decrease the driver's visibility in inclement weather, increasing the risk of a crash,” the letter said.In data submitted by Tesla, the agency found more than 12,000 customer complaints, field reports, warranty claims and other claims related to the screens, the letter said.NHTSA also determined that the failure rate for the screens is higher than the rate for vehicles involved in prior recalls for similar problems.Tesla tried to fix the problem with several over-the-air software updates, but NHTSA said it tentatively believes the fixes are insufficient.“I think it's planned obsolescence, which requires physical replacement of a part which Tesla tried to gloss over by sending a software update,” said Jason Levine, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety.The screen failures also can cause the loss of audible chimes and alerts that are part of Tesla’s “Autopilot” driver-assist system.The letter says that if Tesla formally decides not to do a recall, it has to provide NHTSA with an explanation. The agency can schedule a public meeting on matter and could turn it over to the Justice Department for legal action, Borris said.Borris, who reviewed the letter, called it very thorough and said NHTSA has a strong case should Tesla decide to challenge the agency in court.",0.9517

Why: Too much real competition with many leading EV makers reaching 100,000 in volume in 2022, TSLA 2023 numbers going forward are going to get revised down. GM comes out as a surprise competitor whom may actually be better positioned than tesla (with many partnerships building cheaper cars and they currently hold the title for a best selling EV in China now) ! NIO has battery tech that seems to be better than Teslas, but Tesla's biggest problem is the $25,000 sub car market, you know the main part of the car market for the average consumer. Many EV manufactures are much closer to the goal of a mass market $25,000 < EV. GM is emerging as major competition for Tesla , NIO, XPeng, Li, BYD right now ! GM's stock will go up more than tesla's this year and possibly more than those other EV manufacturers as well. Everyone wrote off ICE manufactures but GM has been making incremental upgrades the whole time. Don't count out ford with the Mach-e either. As far as I'm concerned Tesla will maintain its market share on the higher end EVs but doesn't have a chance against EV competitors that already have sub $25,000 EVs. Tesla makes 4 vehicles out of --> 100 <--- different types needed to replace ICE. Keep in mind that Tesla's rise from 2017-2020 had a lot to do with traditional ICE manufactures only pretending to compete, because they believed Tesla would falter, well fast forward to now and we can see that it is a much different environment with ""everyone working on EVs""",0.795

9383,"Wood and her team seem to have a ""special talent"" for finding and promoting the MOST over-valued speculative-bubble-stocks in this market, and Wood's ""worship"" of the con-artist Elon Musk is particularly troublesome. If Wood can't see that Elon is an obvious fraudster, I question the rest of her abilities at recognizing honest hardworking scientists, engineers and business people making real progress with technology.Understanding how Musk is a con-artist is just a matter of looking. Take, for example, his introduction of ""solar shingles"" when he was trying to use Tesla's stock to bail out the bankrupt SolarCity (saving his cousins and himself from losing millions). The solar-shingle roll-out was Theranos-level fraud. There was no product, no research and development; it was a mock-up of fake shingles (on fake houses -- all done on a Hollywood movie studio set); there was NO energy being generated by any of the tiles, yet Musk stood in front of the crowd explaining how all those roofs around them were generating energy.Or look at Musk's claim -- way back when the stock was under $400, pre-split -- that he had the ""funding secured"" to take the company private. The CEO of a multi-billion dollar company telling millions of followers on social media a complete lie just to juice the stock price -- and the Board and shareholders didn't boot him out after that nonsense?!Or even consider how Musk seems compelled to lie about relatively little things -- and can easily be caught in those lies -- such as the defense he used for calling Unsworth a ""pedo guy""; Musk claimed the term ""pedo guy"" wasn't any insult suggesting one was engaging in certain criminal sexual behavior, but that it was a term, common in his native South Africa, that just means ""creepy old man."" People in South Africa reacted, ""Say what?"" -- it's a bald-faced lie that the term is such an insult in South Africa.Or look at Musk's statements about the bankruptcy that almost happened when Tesla was trying to ramp production of the Model 3. Musk claimed, after the fact, that Tesla was ""single digit weeks"" away from bankruptcy during the Model 3 ramp -- the problem is, this ""single digit weeks"" from bankruptcy never showed itself in the company's SEC-filed financial statements; they always showed they had solvency out about a year or more. Their auditors never required any ""going-concern"" warning with their audited statements. The only conclusion: there are two sets of books and Musk was aware of a bankruptcy risk being just days away, while the other set of books -- provided to the SEC and public-investor -- showed much better solvency.Or just look at the bovine excrement Musk pushes to SpaceX investors -- it's too long of a topic to discuss here, but The Common Sense Skeptic has made an excellent video series (available on YouTube) that debunks the sort of nonsense Musk spews while promoting SpaceX.Musk is a con artist, plain and simple. While that doesn't mean the entire company of Tesla is like a Theranos, it is very likely similar to Enron's type of fraud. Enron did approximately $80 billion of legitimate business a year before its bankruptcy; it was a relatively small amount of accounting fraud at the top -- which hid the true financial condition of the company from shareholders -- that brought the company down. Tesla is a real company, just not a profitable one. While it has shown losses for most of its life, I see enough evidence to conclude those losses were actually a lot LARGER than have been reported; and those quarters of ""profitability"" that got the company into the S&P 500 were all just an accounting fabrication.Silicon Valley start-ups have a saying, ""Fake it until you make it."" It's essentially an admission that ""lying"" is OK while you're trying to build a business. That can work with some technology companies because the profit margins in certain technology companies can be so high, a company can actually make up (and permanently bury) for its previous lying while growing the company. I think Musk has used this ""fake it"" strategy with Tesla -- the problem is: Tesla is a CAR company, with low margins; there is no high-margin pot-of-gold at the end of its growth-stages. My conclusion (looking at a lot more evidence than the few items I mention here): Tesla is a house-of-cards with massive losses ""hidden"" using accounting tricks. (I actually suspect SpaceX and The Boring Co are being used in ways similar to the way Enron used its ""SPVs."") Ultimately, I expect it will implode like Enron did. $TSLA",0.9688

9537,"In the latest delivery report released on Thursday, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) beat most analysts' delivery estimates by handing ownership over to about 88,400 customers in Q1 (Form 8-K filing is here). This was, as expected, a record for any 1st quarter. It easily beat 1Q19 since Model 3 deliveries did not begin in Europe and China until mid-February last year, so Tesla's numbers benefited this year from worldwide deliveries of Model 3 for the entire month of January and early February.However, the ratio of vehicles built versus delivered in the quarter was the worst since 1Q19. While Tesla indeed delivered 88,400 units, it represented 86% of the total production of 102,672 vehicles resulting in a surplus of 14,272 units. Combined with excess inventory from prior quarters, Tesla's unsold inventory spiked to 26,961 units, an increase of 112% from 4Q19.First, we can see the huge increase in unsold units that soared 120%. Part of this increase occurred in China in Jan/Feb where Model 3 deliveries were 83% of production (5,487 deliveries vs. 6,583 units produced. We are still a few weeks away from verifiable March numbers). Europe also appears to have ended with a large surplus inventory. During the quarter, seven ships transported units to Zeebrugge, Belgium with a few continuing on to Southampton, England. TeslaMotorsClub.com member Troy does an excellent job of pulling verifiable data together to track most European sales. For Q1, his spreadsheet (here) shows 22,728 deliveries which are almost identical to 2019 at 22,759. Norway and The Netherlands have been replaced in the top spot by the U.K. This may not account for other smaller EU markets. But if each ship carried an average of 4,000 Tesla vehicles, we can see that a good portion of these unsold units is probably sitting in Europe, waiting to be delivered to buyers in Q2 due to the coronavirus shutdowns in many of those countries.Second, in the press release last week, Tesla oddly chose to combine Model 3 with Model Y production and delivery figures. Some would think they did this to hide relatively low figures for Model Y out the gate. But if we look back to 3Q17, in the above chart, Tesla had no problem reporting just a few hundred cars in Model 3's initial quarter. It would seem Tesla is actually trying to mask the severe drop in Model 3 global sales which were the worst in a year since Q1 2019. That number last year was unusually low for several reasons. First, 4Q18 marked the end of the full $7,500 FITC in the U.S. which pulled Q1 sales forward into Q4. Second, Model 3 deliveries in both China and Europe did not begin until about halfway through the quarter in mid-February. This, of course, made 1Q20 deliveries look better in a YoY comparison.It has been and still is my belief that moving the introduction of the Model Y forward to March from later in the year was due to the slowing of orders for the Model 3 and to fill a drop in revenue that Tesla has known was coming in the first half of 2020. This became very clear last year when total U.S. revenue dropped $2.2 billion from 2018 levels.",0.9674

As per Johnson, the Bitcoin news was released at a time when the company is facing “negative business developments” and is a distraction.The GLJ Research note pointed to declining car sales in China, quality control issues, delay in the German factory, and the inability to obtain the full $1.2 billion in subsidies in that country as the negative factors.The analyst said in his view BTC is an “environmental disaster” as it consumers as much power as the entire country of Switzerland.GLJ noted the potential regulatory pitfalls of the Bitcoin purchase, which they admitted were unlikely.“We see this as a sign of desperation from a CEO whose company is facing real competition for the first time ever,” said the analyst — adding that even if Tesla were to sell its BTC holdings today, it would pocket up to $200 million in profits “that fall 100% to the bottom line, offsetting any losses in its core business of selling cars.”",0.8399

We expect to further ramp to a rate of 10,000 Model 3 vehicles per week, and an annual Tesla vehicle production rate in excess of 500,000, at some point in 2018.Nov 2017 10Q Based on our current progress, we expect to achieve a production rate of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the first quarter of 2018, although the precise progress of the ramp is difficult to predict given that our production growth rate is similar to a stepped exponential, so there may be significant rate increases from one week to the next. In order to optimize the incremental improvement of our automation processes and the efficiency of our capital expenditures, we will implement the capacity to further ramp production to 10,000 units per week only after we have achieved a 5,000 units per week run rateFeb 2018 10kBased on our current progress, we are targeting a production rate of 2,500 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the first quarter of 2018 and 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter. It is important to note that while these are the levels we are focused on hitting and we have plans in place to achieve them, our prior experience on the Model 3 ramp has demonstrated the difficulty of accurately forecasting specific production rates at specific points in time. We are systematically addressing bottlenecks and adding capacity and resources in places like the battery module line where we have experienced constraints, and these actions should result in our Model 3 production rate significantly increasing during the first half of 2018. In some cases, we may not achieve the manufacturing labor efficiencies until we ramp up to fully automated manufacturing lines, which may take us longer than anticipated. In order to optimize the incremental improvement of our automation processes and the efficiency of our capital expenditures, we will implement the capacity to further ramp production to 10,000 units per week only after we have achieved a 5,000 units per week run rate.",0.9985

Chances are they might even be safer, though it's tough to say that definitively.""The propensity and severity of fires and explosions from ... lithium ion battery systems are anticipated to be somewhat comparable to or perhaps slightly less than those for gasoline or diesel vehicular fuels,"" according to the results of an in-depth investigation into the relative fire risks of the two types of vehicles conducted by Battelle for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last fall.About 174,000 vehicle fires were reported in the United States in 2015, the most recent year for which statistics are available from the National Fire Protection Association. Virtually all of those fires involved gasoline powered cars. That works out to about one every three minutes.Tesla claims that gasoline powered cars are about 11 times more likely to catch fire than a Tesla. It says the best comparison is fires per 1 billion miles driven. It says the 300,000 Teslas on the road have been driven a total of 7.5 billion miles, and about 40 fires have been reported. That works out to five fires for every billion miles traveled, compared to a rate of 55 fires per billion miles traveled in gasoline cars.Can the fire risk for electric cars be reduced?Yes. And Risser and others say that is likely to happen.Research is taking place for new materials that might not only make batteries lighter and more efficient, but could possibly make them safer. ""Gasoline is a very risky material. We have had 130 years of designs and experience to make a gasoline powered vehicle as safe as possible.

That is $1.5B of potential revenues per year. Even if 50% is spent on payouts thats still a cool $0.5B and will keep increasing over the years. Think about that!2. Giga factory 3 in China operational: Will announce that production has started and will re-iterate expected #s by the end of this month. This will begin to address the demand in China and the Pacific at a lower cost/vehicle.3. Revenues and profit/loss will be better than expected. It will once again demonstrate (fud and misinformation from shorts, notwithstanding) that every vehicle they sell makes money (or is profitable). The expansion of infrastructure: giga factories, new service/repair centers, additional charging stations etc etc are capital intensive and thats why the expense exceeds their revenues. However, that should slow down once the China factory is in full, operation = more cars sold = more revenues = less loss or even profits in the next year or so.4. TSLA will also show that even in this tough market where all vehicles sales from other companies are going down, demand for TSLAs still remains robust. This talk about 100K vs 97K sold in Q3 is just utter none-sense promoted by dis-tractors.

It took one earnings report for growth to slow (and just a smidgen) and a market reversal to send the stock into a downward correction. In two days it lost 14% of it's over-blown value. It is off more than 20% from its high. Tesla has a similar story in the stock price (nowhere else, mind you), in there is no fundamental support behind the stock price. The valuation is made up, I suppose upon a belief of future earnings. It takes small bad news to send the stock cratering, like rather innocent tweets, and the stock caves 3% immediately.

It's way ahead of the competition, its EVs are superior in quality and performance, and total addressable market has only been 2 percent tapped.

Waymo said that accurately wording the technology could also save lives. Of late, Tesla has been mired in safety-related controversies, which picked up much more steam after a fatal crash in South Korea led to two people being injured and one fatality.At the beginning of 2020, Tesla faced 14 scrutinies by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for accidents that involved its autopilot systems.Why Does It Matter: Waymo clarified that erroneously branding driver assists as fully autonomous sends a wrong message to auto buyers and enthusiasts. The post suggested that misleading impressions could inflate the ability of the vehicle and result in an unnecessary risk to drivers, passengers, and others on the road.""Unfortunately, we see that some automakers use the term 'self-driving' in an inaccurate way, giving consumers and the general public a false impression of the capabilities of driver assist (not fully autonomous) technology,"" Waymo said.""That false impression can lead someone to unknowingly take risks (like taking their hands off the steering wheel) that could jeopardize not only their own safety but the safety of people around them.""",-0.2528

They realize the EVs threat is going to come faster than even they expected. Proof: Tesla continues expansion into China and German factory locations. But here's the biggest IMO: in April 2020, $TSLA will hold their Battery Day event and I expect Tesla to announce their accomplishments over the past year since they acquired several technologies to help improve battery range dramatically. We could see a 30% improvement in range in Tesla vehicles coming out after April and on top of that, we will see a reduction for price to drop below $100 per kilowatt hour. This will be huge. I believe TSLA pps will go from today's low of $600 drive the price up past $1000. The oil sellers realized they don't have much time left as profits will drop significantly for them within 3-5 years as the world will have a massive EV transition. 5 years is what I give all other auto manufacturers to finally have EV models that will also be successfully selling to compete with TSLA to a degree, but this will be a bigger blow to the oil industry....not kill it.....but significant pain to their profits. In the past couple of weeks, you had one of the biggest auto makers announce they are fully committed to EVs more than ever....GM. Oil saw this too and after they had their emergency meetings to deal with a crisis that will start for their industry sooner than they expected, they foolishly decided cutting oil prices will help scramble for as much profits as possible for the few years left for them to take advantage of their monopoly over the auto industry.

10534,"guys serious questionI have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue. This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental gourd futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another vegetable. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's gourd yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Mexico and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the gourd bubble burst on November 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive gourd shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound.

So, TSLA would get $1.4T and would earn $70B (@5% net margin). Now since we've assumed growth stops at 50% marketshare, a reasonable PE would be 12 (No more growth, just dividends). So, 12 x $70B is $840B, which is basically what the market cap is today. Good job.Now TSLA has other businesses and they could get more than 50% marketshare.

Also canceled his parts order and told him he has to return the loaner and take his car to an authorized body shop. He asked multiple times if body damage is structural or cosmetic, but they wouldn't say. Also won't help him get it to a body shop. He called multiple approved body shops in the area and none of them would take his car because they already have such a backlog of model 3 waiting for parts. He also emailed the Tesla body shop. Remember when Elon was going to revolutionize body shops by opening his own so you could get your car fixed the same day? total bs. The poor guy hasn't even gotten the Tesla body shop to respond.

I have analyzed thoroughly and see that TSLA is sitting in the perfect position for the ""ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTIES"" ( the option mm's and their followers/players) to effect the VERY significant , most significant in fact option unwind in the history of TSLA. You see that this friday , the JAN 15 options will expire. These were the former leap options that have been around for a couple of years or so, so they naturally have a lot of open interest , but in fact, they have more open interest than ANY series of options that TSLA has experienced EVER. So much interest , that if you choose the strike price which renders the LOWEST dollar value of ALL the combined options outstanding for JAN 15 expiry added together. ( what all the calls and puts of the whole series would be worth if TSLA closes at that strike price), they would still be worth $14.3 BILLION . That compares with the analgous figure of $380 million for the Jan 22 expiration , a small percentage of the dollar open interest of the jan 15 exp. At yesterday's close of aprox $850, the jan 15 options would be worth aprox $22.6 BILLION . Now I have seen TSLA swallow $2 BILLION of change from the LDV without trouble when it has news or huge momentum, but never has it had to swallow such a difference before.

10914,"Rumor: Tesla Model 2 Already Developed in China & Goes to Production in 2022On January 8, information was leaked from the Chinese media that Tesla had already developed a new car model, and would soon be ready to begin production at its Giga Shanghai. The affordable compact car is expected to be produced and delivered in 2022.According to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, some of the best works of art in the world were created in China, so he believes that projects created in China will also be popular around the world. The Chinese have always been distinguished by originality, speed, and intelligence, so China is a great place to develop, create, and implement the most original and unexpected solutions.At the ceremony of handing over the first made-in-China Model 3s to owners, which took place on January 7, 2020, in Shanghai, Musk announced that Tesla plans to establish its own R&D center in China, where the company will create a car for the whole world. Musk said:“Something that would be super cool...so we’re going to do it...is to try to create a China to actually design an original car in China for worldwide consumption. I think this will be very exciting.""As early as mid-January 2020, Tesla began recruiting employees for the new development center and called on them to help the company build Chinese-style cars.Today, the Chinese media, citing reliable sources, reported that the new Tesla car model already was approved as early as September 2020. Product verification is expected to be completed in March 2021, with production and first deliveries scheduled to begin in 2022. Tesla will build its new model at Giga Shanghai.According to sources, the chassis of the car is based on the Model 3 chassis, which will also speed up and simplify the start of production. Perhaps this is what made it possible to develop a new model so quickly.

10965,"Terrific analysis by Morningstar’s John Rekenthaler. Bottom line: TSLA is a collectible: Most of the company’s terrific stock market performance owes to its business results. In 2010, Tesla’s annual revenues were a modest $117 million. Early believers were undeterred, believing that the firm’s sales would skyrocket. They were correct. Last year, Tesla recorded $31.5 billion in revenues, making for a 39% annualized 10-year growth rate. Tesla would not have appealed to Ben Graham, but he would have appreciated the reason for the stock’s success. Recently, though, Tesla’s stock price has sometimes appeared to diverge from its corporate affairs. In 2020, for example, Tesla gained 780%, although the firm’s revenues and profits finished slightly below analysts’ estimates. True, those results were achieved during an unanticipated global recession, so there was good reason for the stock to rise. But the amount seems excessive. So, too, does the stock’s 19% increase on March 9, a day without significant company news.It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that, to some extent, Tesla’s stock has become a collectible--a security that is prized not solely for its company’s virtues but also for the belief that it will appreciate because others desire it.",0.9951

So did 60 others.Those that weren't laid off in Big Layoff 1 or Big Layoff 2 want to leave because they see the writing on the wall. Top talent is already gone. Gigafactory 1 will soon be Panasonic's. Gigafactory 2 is an empty fraud subject to clawbacks. Gigafactory 3 is an open field in China.The stores are all closing. The Model S and Model X lawsuits continue to pile up because of design and manufacturing defects, including those from buildings cars in a tent. The Model 3 has more flaws than the S or X, but those lawsuits haven't even hit yet for the most part.There isn't enough reserved for warranty repairs. The DOJ was investigating Model 3 production numbers long ago, and is likely triply interested now. The Parulekar accounts payable wire fraud case is still mostly sealed. And there's likely been an SEC referral to DOJ over Musk.Then there's the cash crunch. Today, $920 million in cash vanishes. They misled investors on cash position in the 10-K so they probably only have a couple hundred million left (if that), so the company is running on fumes and has to delay small claims hearings over $5K disputes.Can someone on Wall Street please explain where the $50 billion in value remains for this company?Because if that wasn't enough, the cars also have a tendency to A) change lanes on their own; and B) spontaneously combust, killing people, as if we're back to the days of the Ford Pinto.",-0.163

11040,"Having now watched NIO's presentation I have to say that I'm really impressed.Everything seems very well thought and they are really on the edge of AD. The big range of 1000km, replaceable battery will be able to make this a game changer. This can have Teslas valuation in a few years but with 10 millions of vehicles sold.Building the replacing stations will make ""charging"" much quicker and they don't need so many as the replacing of the battery will take max 5 minutes. They can recharge all the batteries in the station overnight and have them ready the next day. Every car manufacturer will have a replaceable battery.I never thought I might consider investing in a car company, but this looks, even given it's extremely high value something, very interesting. It's interesting to know how much IP they have in form of patents. I haven't researched that yet. They topped the camera by a factor of 7 compared to the current Teslas...use flexible lidar to enhance the tracking of only certain objects, have redundancy with the multiple viewing angles. They equip all cars with the same hardware and you can book AD on a monthly basis which is great if you don't want it or if you travel abroad for a year. It's really a milestone in car manufacturing the way I see it.",0.9932

GM and Ford have some exciting products being released shortly. Very exciting stuff but this is legit competition to Tesla which has been absent in the past.I credit Elon for accelerating [pun] change the future of automobiles. I know I’m happy and excited about this outcome. Legitimate investment experts [Goldman, Forbes & more] are telling us this is a poorly run automobile company making a poor product. Argue all you want about solar panels and rockets this is the main product that this stock is valued for.

You just traveled 100 meters at 70 mph. Ever notice yourself unconsciously slowing down (or covering the brake) in congested areas, when black ice is suspected, or kids/pets playing nearby?

You only lose money and if you want to go long this is a total no go unless you are indoctrinated and believe Tesla is worth so much more than just a car company. My mining stocks had huge gains on Friday even though the metals fell.Why is that?Well bond yields rose but not because the FED wanted it! They rose because nobody wants to hold the bonds any longer. They rise because the inflation is backed into the cake. That being said stupid people sell gold or sell because of margin calls and smart people buy metals and mining stocks. The inflation will be huge. The money velocity is EXTREMELY low at the moment, yet money creation rises exponential. I start to believe this whole pandemic is more about staying in control of the monetary systems around the world and redistribution of wealth from the bottom 99% to the upper 1%. In the scenario of rising bond yields and inflation TESLA is a catastrophic gamble and it's coming this is just the beginning. You ain't seen nothing yet.",0.3088

And China embraces globalization and they fit.Long term I do not see decoupling because the world can not live with separate systems --- two different Internet, two 5G, 6G standards . So that leaves us two scenarios, 1) US does not accept China's rise, US China get into war , 2) US realize China is a big country, its rise is enviable, and accept it and seek ways to benefit from its rising.It scenario 1) happens, we all die. then if we held Tesla stock or held cash when we died it makes no difference. If scenario 2) happens, Tesla stock will grow multiple times, it is much better than holding cash.So scenario one cash and tesla stock the same, scenario 2) Tesla stock win big over cash.

I'm pretty sure all the Tesla bulls will hate me even though I got into Tesla 2 years earlier than majority of you. Most of you probably bought tesla post stock split or above $1000 PRE STOCK SPLIT.I got in Tesla beloe $100s. So I continue to add I to NIO and sell Tesla. Why? Because Tesla is not better than over 10 automakers combined in terms of market cap, especially not Toyota. Tesla is great though, but I never expected tesla to even pass 500 when I got in initially when they were on the verge of bankruptcy.I don't care if Tesla drops because my average is so low that I can laugh at you late buyers post run up. I can't even justify the current market cap.For NIO I can because it's a luxury EV/tech/infrastructure company that has all the components of Tesla except better in an economy that will surpass America aka China.So I can actually justify the market cap moving up because this is Chinas future cash cow. Everything Cathue woods priced in for Tesla is 10-25 years forward and has not been priced in for NIO yet.Hate me? Too bad. So do all my friends who doubted me when I told them to buy tesla 3 years ago and they bought in 2.5kNow I'm saying NIO is like tesla on steroids and will surpass Tesla because the Chinese economy and Chinese companies are undervalued and misunderstood.

Tesla builds utility size solar battery storage facilities (Kauai, PG&E, Australia, Texas). It makes its Powerwall/Pack battery modules and packs. Tesla is beyond the prototype stage in building the class 8 Electric semis at its new Austin GF. Also, the all-stainless steel body electric cybertruck will be built there. Tesla has its own worldwide proprietary Supercharging network. Other charging systems are a confused mixture of different technologies with no universal billing standards/pricing or plugins. Tesla has an incredibly large and learning BEV data base. No one is as close to applying Full Self Driving on a large scale as Tesla. Almost all Teslas built are equipped for a FSD over the air software chargeover (Robotaxi capable). Tesla leads in online software updates and applications. Demand is through the roof. The competition (wish them well) is way behind and “burning” for more cash to catch up than Tesla ever did. Tesla never advertised.

11161,"Cobalt prices ===== another $1,000 per unit disadvantage (*) (**) Like it or not Tesla is the high cost producer. If Cobalt prices continue to spike their disadvantage will eventually grow larger.1.) Tesla uses more Cobalt than other EV makers.2.) Tesla was unable to secure a long term contract with Ivanhoe Mines3.) Tesla does not offer a PHEV - a low cobalt alternative, 4.) GM is working on a battery chemistry with no Cobalt. 5.) All of the other ca makers sell millions of profitable vehicles and can sell EV s at a loss almost indefinitely. 6.) Tesla depends on EVs. January 2018 (((( When BMW AG revealed it was designing electric versions of its X3 SUV and Mini, the going rate for 21 kilograms of cobalt—the amount of the metal needed to power typical car batteries—was under $600. Only 16 months later, the price tag is approaching $1,700 and climbing by the day. ))))2018(( A big part of the GM plan is altering the chemistry of its EV batteries to eliminate cobalt, the most expensive component used in today’s batteries and one whose price on the world market is rising rapidly. ))(*) The actual cost disadvantage is unknown. The $1,000 figure comes from Bloomberg there is not way to verify it. (**) Most long term contracts provide for material cost increases. In the case of Panasonic and Tesla one of these parties has likely taken on the risk. If Panasonic offered Tesla a fixed price for the cells then Panasonic priced the risk into the cells. If there is a clause in the contract that allows Panasonic to pass along material price increases - then Tesla will pay more for the cells. Of course, either party can hedge Cobalt prices in the short term. Panasonic would have hedged Cobalt for the duration of the contract with Tesla. One way Panasonic might hedge the price of Cobalt would be with a long term contract with their suppliers. If Panasonic can contractually pass on price increases to Tesla based on commodity prices then Panasonic might go for a long term contract with their suppliers to get lower prices. And now Panasonic can increase prices to Tesla even though they are not paying more for Cobalt.",0.9909

Still, if one bought at the peak and held on, one would not have too bad a loss considering that INTL has been paying dividends.INTC might have been considered a ""bubble"" in 2000, but it's rise was quite measured and related to fundamental changes (like the introduction of new chips).

11588,"SHAREHOLDER ALERT : Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC Notifies Investors of Class Action Against Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 9, 2018ACCESSWIRE ACCESSWIRE•August 22, 2018NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / August 24, 2018 / Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC notifies investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed Tesla, Inc. (""Tesla"" or the ""Company"") (TSLA) and its CEO, Elon Musk (""Musk""),on behalf of shareholders who purchased or otherwise acquired Tesla securities between the now extended dates of August 7, 2018 to August 14, 2018, (the ""Class Period""). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm's site: www.bgandg.com/tsla.This class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.The complaint states that on August 7, 2018, Musk stated on Twitter: (1) ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420;"" (2) ""Funding secured;"" (3) ""Shareholders could either to sell at 420 or hold shares & go private;"" and (4) ""Investor support is confirmed."" Following these tweets, Tesla shares went up as much as $45.47 per share, or 13%, during intraday trading before closing at $379.57 on August 7, 2018.Since then, both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla's board of directors are reportedly investigating the truth of Musk's tweets, and whether in fact funding had been secured. Several large investors and banks have said that they are unaware of any funding. Following the news of these investigations Tesla stock has dropped to close at $355.49 per share on August 10, 2018.The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) contrary to Musk's statements that funding had been ""secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 per share, no such funding had been secured; and (2) contrary to Musk's statement that investor support to take Tesla private ""is confirmed,"" there was no such confirmation.The complaint continues to allege that on August 13, Musk tweeted ""I'm excited to work with Silver Lake and Goldman Sachs as financial advisors . . . on the proposal to take Tesla private."" However, on August 14, Bloomberg issued an article titled ""Goldman Is Said to Have No Mandate When Musk Tweeted,"" and said that neither entities were working with Musk when Musk wrote that the firms were advising him.A class action lawsuit has already been filed.

With a low of 511 yesterday and then 600+ in premarket, the likes of Morgan Stanley got what they wanted from TSLA and many other stocks. TSLA has so much support above 785 and it can get back faster than the drop over the past few days. The same reasons it got it up to $950+ is the same momentum that will drive it right back up extremely fast when bullish volume returns. The bonus: Model Y deliveries begin today. Today, AMD, APPL, TSLA, NIO have the most bullish volume in premarket....if you bought any of these yesterday, you're already up 10%+ from their yesterday's lows. If you're waiting for the bottom, stop listening to the media frenzy. No one can time the bottom perfectly. What happened in 2008 and 1987 and other huge selloffs are not always the same...and this past week's drop is very different. The virus fear and potential impact to the economy is causing panic, largely induced by the media and a president who doesn't have the ability to calm a nation. Our economy is very healthy and this is not a correction whatsoever. People want to call it that because they've been hoping the world burns so their short positions make some money. The demand for products from $TSLA, $AMD, $AAPL, $NIO are going to continue to change the world and their innovation is why their value is going to keep climbing in the near and long term. The virus will not stop their business. We're not in a plague or apocalypse...keep this perspective. You've got a 50% discount on almost every stock and you're going to make 50% back within a month IMO...likely faster as many know the recent highs of TSLA and others that hit before the virus fear. No other reason for any of the price drops....no recalls, no product failures, no sensational fraud......all of these companies were and are at the top of their game. You are the market...so you decide the price of a stock. Buy and just hold. Never sell in a dip. It's really that simple. Keep buying and holding TSLA and AMD, AAPL, NIO...any others you believe in.

11748,"$TSLA $NIOI only bag on Trump because I voted for him in 2016. He's a smart business man and he promised many things that I thought would finally be acknowledged. And before you Trump supporters get mad, here's why. And you can come try to convince me to revote for him.1. He acknowledged the decline of the U.S dollar purchasing power. He also acknowledged that cronie capitalism was a thing, and that wallstreet was screwing over Americans. While we here are investors, I would give up a lot of my money if everyone jumped on the boat to be agaisnt cronie capitalism. This trade off is worth it. The biggest contradiction was that he uses things like GDP and the stock market to reflect Americas wellbeing. But that's exactly what he was agaisnt. I believe he did this in order to win votes and to please his supporters. But this goes exactly what he was agaisnt.2. Trade with China. In my honest opinion, I would have loved to see more pressure on China and their companies. Why? Even though I invest in companies like NIO and Baba. I only invest in Chinese companies I do extensive research on. To make Chinese companies listed on U.S stock exchanges abide by more rules is a great thing for Both Chinese companies and investors. You get more trust in the company. He did a poor job, with the trade war. Promised deficits, now it's at all time highs. I see no reason to believe this will not happen.3. The U.S debt. Debt effects everyone. And Trump acknowledged the debt and wanted to cut back and bring back jobs. Did he bring back jobs? No, the jobs created were low skill, low requirement jobs that were not necessarily needed by society. That is why the unemployment rate was hit so hard during the COVID-19. Because these jobs created were non essential for a reason. You get this when you increase our debt ""fake jobs and service based.""Is this Trumps fault? No.Large corporations have more power and decide where they hire people.Zoom is another step towards the solidification of outsourced remote work. So not only is our manufacturing being hit but our physical labor is too.Again, not Trumps fault, a problem in the making for decades.Trump has increased the debt by over 36% and will continue to do so. This is not okay because while Trumps supporters will be dead in 100 years. The future of America will have to pay for these things.If you expected China or any other nation to produce things for free, you're dead wrong.4. A win win or a lose lose:The U.S might still be NO.1. But this is being challenged tremendously. And if you don't believe me. Look outside, social unrest, distrust in the goverment, decline in political participation, tons of negative propaganda about China (this shows insecurity to me, not security. When you have to slander a threat rather than beat them shows WEAKNESS.)This is not Trump's fault. But Trump wants to participate in an unwinnable battle with China. Nope. You can't beat them. Because America is the people, not the clown politicians. And how are your people doing? More divided than ever (you win by working as a team and having structure, having social norms that allow strangers to have similar morals and beliefs), we are losing on metrics from wealth inequality, education, technology, SKILLED LABOR ( unemployment rate doesn't matter if you're raising a bunch of idiots that can't transition into the future.)To be fair, if Trump could be president till the day he dies. Perhaps maybe if he busted out the real facist side of him and acknowledged the real problems he did pre election. MAYBE then U.S would be a winner again or head in the right direction. People are so dumb that they need to be told what to do.And because Trump can't do this. It's a win win or a lose lose. You can't be NO.1 forever and history has proven that. Rome? Whatever, people these days have the attention span of a gold fish and are too busy swiping right that they can't even fathom the predicament we are in.We need to work with our allies and get China on board. If we don't everyone loses. This is how wars start. It's okay, you don't have to be number 1 forever, especially if you didn't ensure your place as no.1 by making the sacrifices you tool to get there. And this isn't Trumps fault. He acknowledged this pre election. But now, he has taken the wrong steps towards creating a better future. It's better off being a win win than a lose lose. I actually like Bidens approach to create skilled labor jobs and focus on education. We have to make the sacrifices now to ensure a better future. Why did America give up on investing in our future? Trump. You can't win the battle of capitalism and technocracy with China. They're leagues ahead and people in America are too stupid to realize that.5. Handling of the COVID-19. I don't know if the COVID-19 is real nor fake. But you had a good chance at unifying a divided country by separating petty differences. You didn't, you made the country more divided.",0.9983

I was a victim of the Texas power outages last week & I’m seriously thinking of buying a new roof with Tesla solar shingles & 4 Tesla power walls for my garage, so I can get off the grid & become energy independent. The power companies are going to be raising the rates for all Texas electricity customers because they just paid $9 per Kwh for 3 days when they normally pay $0.06 per Kwh. Those of us whom can afford to get off the grid & buy the Tesla roof & power stations will be making that investment instead of paying more for our electric company’s mismanagement of Texas power resources last week. This is why I invested in Tesla last week. I am similar to Warren Buffet in that I only invest in companies that make products or provide services that I’d actually buy. I wasn’t a huge fan of their cars, but I do plan to buy their solar shingles & power stations so I’ll never have to live through the blackouts I suffered through last week & because I don’t want to pay the higher rates for electricity over the next few years.
