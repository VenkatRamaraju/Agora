There is never a situation in which there is not a way out—but, out of habit, most people continue to choose the “lack” perspective until they eventually find themselves where it seems that there are no more choices. But as you hold to your intention to look for evidence of Well-Being and thriving and success and happiness, you will tune yourself to the vibrations of those things—and so those kinds of good-feeling experiences will dominate your life.Excerpted from Money and the Law of Attraction on 8/31/08Our Love,Esther",0.9595

35,"WE CREATE OUR CIRCUMSTANCESPhilosophers have long struggled with the great question of our freedom of choice on the one hand, and our belief in a higher destiny on the other. Is life determined by fate, or do we enjoy genuine freedom?Generally, Judaism would seem to subscribe to a personal freedom in matters of morality, faith and the ethical choices we make in life. But when it comes to things like life and death, and even health and wealth, much as we would like to think we are in the driver’s seat, we do seem to be subject to forces beyond our control. Where we live, how long we will live, how comfortably we will live—these are all in G‑d’s hands. Where we can and must choose is what kind of life we will lead. Whether it will be a G‑dly, righteous, upstanding, decent and honest life—this is up to us, and us alone. G‑d steps back to grant us the freedom to determine how good, how kind and how Jewish we will, or will not, be.And Jacob lifted his feet and went on his way (Genesis 29:1). This verse from our Parshah tells of Jacob’s journey in his escape from the wrath of Esau. He was en route to Haran, where he would eventually establish his family and lay the foundations for the Jewish people. But why the curious language, “And Jacob lifted his feet”? Does the Torah really need to tell us that in order to move, we have to first lift our feet? Was he stuck in a swamp or something?So many of us look at our circumstances and shrug our shoulders, “Nu, what can you do?” If we were born into poverty or raised in a less-than-privileged environment, we resign ourselves to being doomed to failure. So many people have told me that they were part of the “lost generation” of Jews who had no Jewish education or upbringing. Their immigrant parents were so busy surviving in a new world that they had no time or headspace to raise their children with the Jewish value system they themselves had back in Europe. Tragically, these individuals felt that, Jewishly, they were lost forever.Rabbi Jonathan Sacks (Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom) tells the story of how, as a young philosophy student at Cambridge, he traveled the world visiting great leaders. When he came to see the Lubavitcher Rebbe, the Rebbe asked him what he was doing for the Jewish students at Cambridge. He began by saying, “In the circumstances I currently find myself . . .” whereupon the Rebbe interrupted him and said, “No one ‘finds himself’ in circumstances. We create our own circumstances.”Of course, there are times when we will find ourselves in circumstances beyond our control; but throughout life, we will find ample scope and opportunities to improve our own circumstances. G‑d gives each of us our own unique qualities, talents and potential, and it is up to us to use and develop these gifts. Life is full of inspiring examples of individuals who have overcome disabilities and disadvantages of one kind or another. In the Jewish world, many have risen to prominence from the humblest beginnings. The Torah is the birthright of every Jew. We just have to go out and claim it.The words of our Parshah are quite deliberate and well-chosen after all. “Jacob lifted his feet and went on his way.” Some people follow their feet wherever they will take them. No matter the direction, they simply coast along, allowing their feet to lead them.Not so Jacob. He was master of his feet and master of his circumstances. He set his feet on the right road, and became master of his destiny.",0.9986

54,"What Goldman Sachs really needs to do to accelerate its growth rate and strengthen its technology leadership in the investment industry is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for GS (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if GS just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem.

61,"A readRabbi, you might say, the entire notion of a “Chosen Religion” might be true if G-d did indeed appear at Sinai. But can you prove that he did?The Sinai episode is an article of faith, yet I suggest that you give honest consideration to the following thought. Billions of people throughout the world heard about Sinai from their parents. These parents heard it from their parents, who in turn heard about it from their own parents. This chain of tradition goes back thousands of years, but it had to originate somewhere.Is it reasonable to assume that at some point in history a group of scholars persuaded an entire generation to accept a hitherto unheard of tale of fantasy? Is it reasonable to assume that not a single voice of dissent was heard at that time? If there was dissent it would surely have been recorded.By contrast, is it any less reasonable to assume that the original transmitters of this tradition believed it because they experienced it themselves?

The demand to end the flow of funds to Amana is based on the facts that Amana is a private for-profit entity ineligible to receive these funds, construction in the occupied territories is not one of the Ministry of the Interior’s criterion for allocation of these funds, and that Amana uses the money to build illegal outposts.Last July, Peace Now published information on the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council’s subsidies after a long legal battle, due to the council’s attempts to conceal the matter. The information revealed that one of Amana’s most significant sources of funding, which amounts to tens of millions of shekels per year, are the funds transferred to it by various authorities in the West Bank.As published in the Israeli media, from the years 2013-2015 Amana received over NIS 94 million from various authorities in the West Bank, contrary to regulations and against the law.

The 1% , with their money in the market, are seeing significant gains---while those w/o 401Ks, IRAs, brokerage accounts, or even decent paying jobs are being bypassed.

I do think that is a problem that begins to boil over at some point. Moreover if Republicans win either Senate runoff, the 2022 election becomes huge --because maintaining or even adding just one net Senate seat then solidifies a Republican Senate for 4-6 years even during a second term for Biden or Harris. It's almost a given the House will turn Republican in two years, but the Senate is the real key (as it also goes to approving SCOTUS justices should Thomas retire).

You just get dirty and the pig enjoys it.”Both these pieces of advice are worth remembering for the inevitable moments that we find ourselves in conflict or at cross purposes with one of those nutty, obnoxious, stubborn jerks that make up a certain percentage of the population. Although it’s tempting to fight and argue with them, it rarely ends well, because you can’t beat someone with nothing to lose, and it’s impossible to reason someone out of a position they didn’t reason themselves into in the first place.

These long-overdue actions break antique log-jams dating back nearly 70 years and offer fresh opportunities to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Bravo to Trump for enduring the slings and arrows of conventional thinking to take these courageous steps and then stick with them.That said, there's a problem. Both moves were undertaken for what appear to be the wrong reasons. This is not an abstract worry but implies that today's celebration could turn into tomorrow's fiasco.First problem for Israel: Trump says he recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital to settle the Jerusalem issue. Listen to him ruminate on this: ""The hardest subject [that Israeli and Palestinian negotiators] had to talk about was Jerusalem. We took Jerusalem off the table, so we don't have to talk about it anymore. They never got past Jerusalem.""This suggests Trump thinks recognition solved the knotty Jerusalem issue, as though this were a New York real-estate transaction and he made a side-deal about zoning regulations or union representation. But it's not. Far from being ""off the table,"" Trump's action made Jerusalem an unprecedented center of attention and contention.If not for Amb. Nikki Haley's veto, the U.N. Security Council would unanimously have condemned Jerusalem recognition. For example, members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation overwhelmingly condemned his step, as did members of both the U.N. Security Council and the General Assembly. In addition, recognition caused Palestinian violence against Israelis to triple. Thus, Trump made Jerusalem a more disputed issue than it had been previously.How will Trump react when he",0.9776

181,"FROM IF AMERICANS ONLY KNEWAfter original bill stalled in 2019, Rubio & Coons introduce new bill expected to give Israel at least $38 billion over the next 10 years – over $7,000 per minute.News analysis by Alison WeirRepublican Marco Rubio and Democrat Chris Coons have introduced legislation expected to give Israel a minimum of $38 billion over the next 10 years. (The text for the bill, S.3176, is not yet available on the Congressional website.)The new bill has been introduced because a similar one introduced last year, S.1, had stalled. The new version reportedly omits a section that would have let state governments punish Americans for boycotting Israel, which had caused some Senators to oppose it on First Amendment grounds.The new bill is expected to contain the same financial provisions as the previous one: solidifying into federal law a 2016 Memorandum of Understand (MOU) with Israel procured by the Obama administration, which had been a non-binding agreement, while changing the $38 billion in the MOU from a ceiling to a floor.Given the influence of the Israel lobby, that change would likely lead to an increased amount of US tax money going to Israel in coming years, possibly even in 2020.The bill text said it was “the largest single pledge of assistance ever.” The money works out to $7,230 per minute to Israel, and equals about $23,000 per each Jewish Israeli family of four.The aid is broken into two parts: $33 billion in direct military aid and $5 billion in certain weapons programs.The previous bill also required NASA to cooperate with Israel’s space agency, despite accusations of Israeli espionage, and some additional perks. It is unknown if those provisions are also in this year’s legislation.An earlier version of the legislation had received widespread support, including co-sponsorship by Elizabeth Warren, despite the fact that it appears to violate several US laws.In a press release, the Senators linked their new bill to an alleged need to help Israel protect itself during heightened tensions following the US assassination of the top Iranian general, which had been urged by Israeli officials. Israel has long targeted Iran as an adversary to be weakened.Rubio and Coons often serve as foot soldiers for AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. They were featured at the 2018 AIPAC national conference (video here).Rubio’s career has been funded from the beginning by multi-billionaire Israel partisans such as Normal Braman, Paul Singer, Sheldon Adelson, and Larry Ellison. Rubio has close ties to the pro-Israel neocons who pushed the U.S. into the disastrous Iraq war.Coons is a stalwart Israel supporter, including working with Lindsey Graham in one of the Israel lobby’s latest entities: Pro-Israel America.Alison Weir is executive director of If Americans Knew, president of the Council for the National Interest, and author of Against Our Better Judgment: The Hidden History of How the U.S. Was Used to Create Israel.RELATED:Israel would get far more than $38 billion under the new dealSenate about to vote on bill to give $38 billion to Israel, largest aid package in US historyThe pro-Israel billionaires & neocons behind Marco RubioThe Staggering Cost of Israel to AmericansCongress has introduced 50 pieces of legislation about Israel in 2019 If you value this information, please donate so that we can continue our work.

The Falic family, owners of the ubiquitous chain of Duty Free America shops, fund a generous, and sometimes controversial, philanthropic empire in Israel that stretches deep into the West Bank. The family supports many mainstream causes as well as far right causes considered extreme even in Israel. (AP Photo/Ariel Schalit)HEBRON, West Bank (AP) — When travelers shop at dozens of duty free stores at airports worldwide, they may be paying for more than a bottle of vodka or a box of chocolates.The Falic family of Florida, owners of the ubiquitous chain of Duty Free Americas shops, funds a generous and sometimes controversial philanthropic empire in Israel that runs through the corridors of power and stretches deep into the occupied West Bank. An Associated Press investigation shows that the family has donated at least $5.6 million to settler groups in the West Bank and east Jerusalem over the past decade, funding synagogues, schools and social services along with far-right causes considered extreme even in Israel.The Falics support the ultranationalist Jewish community in Hebron, whose members include several prominent followers of a late rabbi banned from Israeli politics for his racist views, and whose movement is outlawed by the U.S. as a terrorist organization. They back Jewish groups that covertly buy up Palestinian properties in east Jerusalem, and they helped fund an unauthorized settlement outpost in the West Bank.They have supported groups that are pushing for the establishment of a Third Temple for Jews at the holiest and most contested site in the Holy Land. They also have given more money than any other donor to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a strong supporter of settlements, and have donated to other leaders of his Likud party.The Falics' philanthropy is not limited to the settlements, and they support many mainstream causes in the U.S. and Israel, such as hospitals, athletics and helping the needy. But they are a key example of how wealthy U.S. donors have bolstered the contentious settlement movement.""Far-right foreign donors are a pillar of the settlement enterprise,"" said Brian Reeves, a spokesman for Peace Now, an Israeli anti-settlement watchdog group.Most of the world considers Jewish settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem to be obstacles to peace that gobble up territories claimed by the Palestinians for a future independent state. The international community overwhelmingly believes the settlements violate international law, which prohibits an occupying power from transferring its own population into the territory it occupies.However, Israel considers the territories ""disputed,"" and says the fate of the settlements should be determined through negotiations.In a response to AP questions through his lawyer, Simon Falic, who spoke on behalf of the family, said Jews should be able to live anywhere in the Holy Land, whether it's Israel, Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem or the West Bank. He condemned violence and claimed none of the groups he supports do anything illegal under Israeli law.""We are proud to support organizations that help promote Jewish life all over the Land of Israel,"" said Falic, whose business is based in Miami, Florida. ""The idea that the mere existence of Jewish life in any geographical area is an impediment to peace makes no sense to us.""Since the capture of the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war, the settler population has grown to about 700,000 people, roughly 10% of Israel's Jewish population. In recent years, it has received a boost from Netanyahu's pro-settler government and from a far more tolerant attitude by President Donald Trump, whose top Mideast advisers are longtime settlement supporters.This growth has been fueled in part by fundraising arms for leading settlement groups in the United States, which allow them to collect tax-deductible contributions from thousands of American donors.",0.9988

What would you do?In Malcolm Gladwell’s massive bestseller Outliers: The Story of Success, he posits that 10,000 hours of deliberate practice is required to master any skill. Implicit in Gladwell’s argument is that success is the manifestation of specialization. If you want to be among the best at something, you have to focus solely on that singular skill.David Epstein first disputed the 10,000-hour rule in his book The Sports Gene. He was then invited to the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference to debate Gladwell on this topic of specialization. Neither they or their critics would have predicted the friendship that came out of the debate. But their discussions spawned the ideas that became Epstein’s second book, Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World—which doesn’t just challenge the 10,000-hour rule, it may well debunk it. How did Gladwell take it? As Epstein explained in our interview with him for DailyStoic.com:He could have viewed our ideas as in zero-sum competition. But he didn’t. He viewed it as an opportunity to engage in more discussion—often politely antagonistic but very productive discussion—and consequently we learned from one another. [This] set in motion what became not only a really productive intellectual relationship for me, but also a model of how two people publicly associated with certain ideas can engage without forcing zero-sum competition.Seneca deliberately read and immersed himself in the work of people he disagreed with. He frequently and unapologetically quotes Epicurus, the head of a rival philosophical school! Knowing this may be perceived as abandoning the writings of his avowed philosophical school, he often clarifies his intentions. “I am wont to cross over even into the enemy’s camp,” he explains, “not as a deserter, but as a scout.” Like Gladwell and Epstein, he didn’t view Epicurus’ ideas as in zero-sum competition with his own. They were a chance to learn. They were not an obstacle but an opportunity to broaden and bolster his intellectual arsenal.“If someone is able to show me that what I think or do is not right, I will happily change,” Marcus said. “For I seek the truth, by which no one ever was truly harmed.

International researchers in the journal Science & Global Security analyzed previously unpublished results of radiation testing at a U.S. lab of thyroid organs from sheep in southeastern Australia in order to make their determination.

Or maybe it seems like you constantly attract drama in your life. You may choose to feel sorry for yourself and feed off self-pity instead of acknowledging what you may be projecting.

367,"RELIGION OF PROTESTJudaism was and remains the world’s great religion of protest. The heroes of faith did not accept; they protested. They were willing to confront God himself. Abraham said, “Shall the Judge of all the earth not do justice?” (Gen. 18:25). Moses said, “Why have you done evil to this people?” (Ex. 5:22). Jeremiah said, “Why are the wicked at ease?” (Jer. 12:1). That is how God wants us to respond. Judaism is God’s call to human responsibility. The highest achievement is to become God’s partner in the work of creation.When Adam and Eve sinned, God called out “Where are you?” As Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, the first Lubavitcher Rebbe, pointed out, this call was not directed only to the first humans. It echoes in every generation. God gave us freedom, but with freedom comes responsibility. God teaches us what we ought to do but he does not do it for us. With rare exceptions, God does not intervene in history. He acts through us, not to us. His is the voice that tells us, as He told Cain before he committed his crime, that we can resist the evil within us as well as the evil that surrounds us.The responsible life is a life that responds. The Hebrew for responsibility, achrayut, comes from the word acher, meaning an “other.” Our great Other is God himself, calling us to use the freedom He gave us, to make the world that is more like the world that ought to be. The great question, to which the life we lead is the answer, is, which voice will we listen to? The voice of desire, as in the case of Adam and Eve? The voice of anger as in the case of Cain? Or the voice of God calling on us to make this a more just and gracious world?

It quickly became clear there would be little to no coordination among the banks.Goldman and Morgan each raced to liquidate positions tied to Archegos.The discussion among so-called prime brokerages was extremely unusual and has happened only a handful of times in recent memory, in some cases averting liquidations.The decision to sell early helped insulate Goldman from losses that have hit other banks.

Here lies the core of free expression, of personal autonomy, which grants to every person the right to write and shape their life story in their own way…”Last night, I chose to mourn in a way that is the most meaningful for me and to exercise my democratic right to freedom of expression.Each year, the ceremony concludes with the Arab-Jewish Women’s Choir, Rana’s rendition of Chava Alberstein’s “Chad Gadya (One Goat).” And each year, I am deeply moved and motivated by these Arab and Jewish women singing together the words: “How long will the cycle of horror last?

488,"realityhat has made it particularly difficult for Orthodox Jewish survivors to come forward is a pervasive communal attitude that informing on a fellow Orthodox Jew to the secular authorities (mesirah) is a crime worse than the alleged abuse. Rabbis tell us that we are obligated to ask them for permission before reporting sexual abuse. Agudath Israel, which lobbied fiercely against the Child Victims Act, has since 2011 maintained that as their officially stated policy. Many people who have nonetheless come forward, braving the inevitable backlash, have lost their jobs and homes, their children have been expelled from their schools, and many have experienced a complete ostracism from their communities.With the opening of the lookback window, however, we as a community will have the opportunity to truly reflect on the crimes we’ve enabled, and commit to meaningful change. Already lawsuits are being filed against many major institutions across the Orthodox Jewish community, from the Modern Orthodox Yeshiva University to ultra-Orthodox Hasidic institutions. The survivors filing those lawsuits are well aware of the social costs of their actions, but they’re nonetheless pursuing justice because for them, living without it is not an option.Survivors of child sexual abuse often struggle with depression, addiction, self-harm, eating disorders, difficulty forming and maintaining healthy relationships, PTSD, anxiety disorders, and suicidal ideation. That’s been no different in the Orthodox Jewish community, it’s just been well hidden. Survivors who struggle with addiction, or question their faith, or underperform at school, or suffer from mental illness are often discarded by the community, blamed for these issues they face as though they’re deliberate unprovoked rebellions, rather than recognizable reactions to trauma, and once othered by the community, no longer considered the community’s responsibility.Well, now, we’re afforded an opportunity. The lawsuits are coming whether we like it or not. The truth will be in the media whether we want it to be there or not. Institutions will be paying out settlements and judgements whether they want to or not. Whereas the community was previously afforded an undeserved boon by New York’s former statute of limitations for child sexual abuse, which cut off a survivor’s access to justice at age 23, allowing community leaders to exert pressure on survivors until they reached that age and then breathe easy knowing they’d gotten away with it, that’s no longer the reality in New York State.The Child Victims Act, aside from opening this one-year lookback window, extended the criminal statute of limitations for child sexual abuse to age 25 for misdemeanors, and age 28 for felonies, and extended the civil statute of limitations to age 55. While rabbinic leaders may have previously been successful in coercing survivors into silence until age 23 — by threatening their marriageability, their parents, their placements in schools — will they be able to maintain that stranglehold when survivors have until age 55 to file a civil suit going forward?We as a community can either resist this change and fail, losing not only money but any shred of respectability and credibility we have as a moral, God-fearing, Torah-observant community — or we can take this opportunity to stop supporting abusers, stop coercing victims into silence, accept that we’ve sinned grievously, make reparations to the survivors of these horrific crimes, commit to supporting them in the future, and never again allow institutional or communal concerns come before the fundamental safety and wellbeing of our children.The choice is ours.Asher Lovy is the director of community organizing for ZA’AKAH, an organization dedicated to advocating for survivors of child sexual abuse in the Orthodox Jewish community.GIVE TODAYSUPPORT FEARLESS JOURNALISM Join thousands of readers and give today to help fund the Forward’s reliable reporting, intelligent analysis, and a Jewish voice you can trust on news, culture, lifestyle and opinion.

555,"GUILTY ON ALL COUNTSBY JEFFREY HELLERJERUSALEM (Reuters) - An indictment submitted to Israel's parliament on Monday against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu names more than 300 prosecution witnesses, including wealthy friends and former aides, in three graft cases against him.By formally sending the indictment to the legislature, after announcing charges of bribery, breach of trust and fraud on Nov. 21, Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit set the clock ticking on a 30-day period in which Netanyahu can seek parliamentary immunity from prosecution.Such protection seems unlikely, with Israeli politics in disarray after inconclusive elections in April and September and the failure of Netanyahu and his main challenger, Benny Gantz, to secure a ruling majority in the legislature.Netanyahu, in office for the past decade, has denied any wrongdoing, saying he is a victim of an attempted ""coup"" waged by legal authorities trying to unseat a popular right-wing leader.As prime minister, he is under no legal obligation to resign after being charged. No date has been set for the opening of the trial, with three judges presiding in Jerusalem District Court.The indictment submitted to parliament listed 333 witnesses for the prosecution. Legal experts said the long roster meant proceedings could go on for years.They include U.S. casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam, Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan, Australian billionaire James Packer and retired Israeli security chiefs, and several former aides who will be state witnesses against him.Netanyahu poured scorn on the length of the witness list.""When an accusation is true, you don't need 333 witnesses,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""When the accusation is untrue, not even 333 witnesses will help.""TALKS DEADLOCKEDIn one case, Netanyahu is suspected of wrongfully requesting and accepting expensive gifts, including champagne and cigars, from Milchan and Packer. Neither has been charged with any wrongdoing.Another case focuses on allegations that Netanyahu promised the owner of Israel's best-selling newspaper to push for regulations on its main competitor, owned by Adelson.Netanyahu also is accused of granting regulatory favors worth about 1.8 billion shekels ($500 million) to Bezeq Telecom Israel in return for positive coverage on a website owned by its former chairman.Talks between Netanyahu's Likud and Gantz's centrist Blue and White party on a ""national unity"" government are deadlocked.If no agreement is reached within 10 days - the end of a three-week period in which legislators can nominate a candidate to try to form a government - Israel is likely to hold a new election.(Editing by Timothy Heritage)Copyright 2019 Thomson Reuters.GALLERIESCIVICCartoons on President Donald TrumpPOLITICSThe Women of the 116th CongressTHE CIVIC REPORTThe Photos You Should See – Nov. 2019CIVICThe Week in Cartoons: Nov. 25-29RECOMMENDEDHEALTHIEST COMMUNITIES'Grey's Anatomy' Increased Sexual Assault AwarenessBEST STATESWashington Examines Firearm Background ChecksNATIONAL NEWSWinter Weather Complicates TravelWORLD REPORTChina Fires Back at Trump Over Hong KongAMERICA 2020And Then There Were 16RECOMMENDEDThe 10 Worst PresidentsNot all U.S. presidents are missed once they leave the White House.U.S. News StaffNov. 6, 2019BRANDFUSEad content by Jenny CraigI Lost 11 Pounds in a Month on Jenny Craig’s New Science-Backed PlanHere’s what happened when writer Cathie Ericson spent four weeks on Jenny Craig’s Rapid Results plan.Cartoons on President Donald TrumpNov. 27, 2019, at 2:18 p.m.Photos: Obama Behind the ScenesA collection of moments during and after Barack Obama's presidency.June 27, 2018Photos: Trump and His SupportersA collection of moments before and during Donald Trump's presidency.Jan. 30, 2019Winter Weather Complicates TravelWhile more than a foot of snow fell in some places, persistent severe weather is forecast to impact more than a dozen states through Tuesday.Alexa LardieriDec. 2, 2019China Fires Back at Trump Over Hong KongBeijing’s decision to block U.S. military ships and planes from accessing the city follows its outrage at President Donald Trump’s support for Hong Kong protests.Paul D.

557,"THIS JERK HEADED PEACE TALKS WITH PALESTINIANS!!! Shepard Smith: People Go To Prison For What Jared Kushner DidHuffPost Mary Papenfuss,HuffPost 9 hours ago . Reactions Sign in to like Reblog on Tumblr Share Tweet Email White House senior aide Jared Kushner’s multiple omissions on required financial disclosure forms for his security clearance would “be a crime, punishable by prison” for other people, Fox News host Shepard Smith said Thursday.“Apparently not in this case,” Smith added.The White House has implied that Kushner’s frequent revisions to his financial forms to provide information that was incorrect or missing have caused delays which have held up his security clearance, even though he works with an interim clearance that allows him to view classified information.Two sources, however, also told CNN Thursday that Kushner will not obtain full security clearance until special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation is complete.Donald Trump’s son-in-law “submitted his application and did not include 100 contacts with foreigners,” Smith said on “Shepard Smith Reporting.” He “later had to go back and include them ... but he did not include the meeting in Trump Tower with the Russian lawyer and Russian translator. So that was another amendment to this thing.”Revisions made last July by Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, added 77 previously undisclosed assets and more than $10 million in holdings.Further additions were made as recently as last month, according to a letter obtained by Talking Points Memo. The letter to White House deputy counsel Stefan Passantino dated Jan. 3 added a number of additional business interests. It also corrected and added new corporate positions that Kushner was legally required to disclose in his initial paperwork.A conviction for withholding, misrepresenting or falsifying information on the form for security clearance can result in up to $10,000 in fines and five years in prison.“It’s really uncommon you’d still be trying to get the form correct at this stage in the game,” Don Fox, a former acting director and general counsel of the Office of Government Ethics, told TPM.

If you only spend 5 days on ventilation the survival rate could be as high as 50%. With coronavirus one can spend a couple weeks or even longer on a ventilator. It's not really so much who gets a ventilator and who does not as much as avoiding that last step altogether. Wash hands frequently, social distance, and hope plasma therapy or some intermediate drug intervention works until we get a vaccine. Other than that, herd immunity is the time tested curve flattener.

Sign up here.It was December 25th, 1776. One of the darkest times in the American Revolution. George Washington was planning to cross the Delaware, a desperate move necessitated by a string of setbacks and ebbing support for the revolution across his struggling country.Whose fault was this despair? How had things gone so poorly?Washington wasn’t interested in those questions. As he wrote in a letter to Robert Morris from his headquarters that day, “it is in vain to ruminate upon, or even reflect upon the Authors or Causes of our present Misfortunes.” Instead of looking backwards, Washington said, “we should rather exert ourselves,” meaning they should focus on how they were going to respond. His response was a daring attack on the Hessian Troops in Trenton the next day, which may well have saved his army and the floundering nation.This mindset is part and parcel of the Stoicism that Washington had known and followed all of his life. Looking at events in the calm light of mild philosophy, as he liked to quote from the Stoic philosopher Cato, deciding not to be ruled by his phantasai and instead focusing on what he’d do next. And that’s what we should take a minute to think about this Christmas, whether we’re busy working or taking some time with family or planning out how we’re going to use 2020 for a fresh start.Not what caused our troubles. Not who authored them. Not how much blame they deserve. Those questions are irrelevant distractions—answering them an exercise done only in vain. What matters is how we plan to exert ourselves, how we plan to fix our situation, how we plan to respond to what life has thrown at us. Whether it’s a passive aggressive family member, a struggling business, or a series of bad personal choices, we have the power to decide what we’re going to do next.We can exert ourselves.

604,"Security of J StreetFriend --This week’s Israeli election -- an unprecedented third contest in under a year -- brought good news and bad news.The good news: Once again, after engaging in a vitriolic, hate-filled campaign attempt to win an outright 61-seat majority for his right-wing bloc, Benjamin Netanyahu came up short.Thanks in part to a historically successful night for the majority-Arab Joint List party, Netanyahu still lacks a clear path to forming a governing coalition. That’s the same position he was in both before and after the first two elections of the past year. In some ways, we’re right back where we started.The bad news: Even with Netanyahu on the brink of standing trial for corruption, his opponents were unable to deliver a political knockout blow. That means that, whether he succeeds in forming a government, whether his opponents somehow manage to form a government or whether Israel heads to an astounding fourth election, he likely will remain in power as prime minister for at least the next few months.It means that the chances are still very high that, with a green light from President Trump and in coordination with Ambassador Friedman, Netanyahu will take steps at some point in the coming weeks to advance illegal, unilateral annexations of Palestinian territory in the West Bank.That’s why our work leading the fight against annexation is now more important than ever. It’s why we’re pushing Congress, presidential candidates and Jewish leaders across the country to stand up against annexation and settlement expansion. It’s why we’re leading a campaign to make sure the Democratic platform commits to supporting Israeli security AND opposing the occupation.And it’s why we’re reaching out to ask for your support to make sure that we succeed. Please chip in what you can to help us build urgent opposition to any move by Netanyahu that could permanently damage prospects for Israeli-Palestinian peace.Our work can’t generate new political leadership for Israel -- only the Israeli people can do that. But by focusing on our own politics, we can help ensure that Donald Trump is defeated this November, doing everything we can to elect the eventual Democratic nominee. We can help ensure that the next president enters office with a clear mandate to oppose occupation, undo the damage of the Trump administration’s disastrous policies and firmly lead the way toward a just, viable and lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.It’s not going to be easy. At last week’s AIPAC conference, we saw crowds give standing ovations to Vice President Pence, Ambassador Friedman and Prime Minister Netanyahu. We heard not a word of opposition to annexation. One wouldn’t have known that it was an imminent possibility had it not been for Netanyahu boasting about his plans to move the process forward.We took away a loud and clear message that AIPAC and its allies would rather have four more years of Donald Trump than see him replaced by any candidate who will oppose occupation and stand up for peace. But we know that doesn’t reflect the views of the vast majority of American Jews.We know that the majority of Jewish Americans oppose Trump and are worried about Israel’s direction under Netanyahu. We’re ready to mobilize that majority to defend democracy, promote diplomacy and achieve a better future for Israelis and Palestinians.But we need your help to mak",0.9974

635,"Thank you sincerelyHome » Psychology » 23 Signs You’re Suffering From a Victim Mentality23 Signs You’re Suffering From a Victim Mentalityby Mateo Sol 12 CommentsVictim Mentality Signs imageSaveAt some point in life, we are all victimized. Whether as children, teenagers, or adults, we all suffer emotional, physical, or psychological abuse to varying degrees.While it’s important that we come to terms with what has happened to us, and that we have indeed been victimized, we cannot move on with our lives unless we step out of the victim role and into the survivor role.Having a victim mentality goes far beyond the experience of being victimized. When we carry a victim mentality, we are basically filtering our entire existence through a narrow mental lens that we have adopted as our primary way of perceiving the world.What is a Victim Mentality?Victim mentality is a psychological term that refers to a type of dysfunctional mindset which seeks to feel persecuted in order to gain attention or avoid self-responsibility. People who struggle with the victim mentality are convinced that life is not only beyond their control, but is out to deliberately hurt them. This belief results in constant blame, finger-pointing, and pity parties that are fuelled by pessimism, fear, and anger.Simply put, having a victim mentality means that you blame other people and circumstances for the unhappiness you feel.How Self-Victimization DevelopsNo one is born with a victim mentality, just as no one is born clinically depressed or anxious. Instead, the victim mentality is an acquired personality trait, meaning that it is the result of early life conditioning and coping mechanisms.Most victims were victimized in some way as children, whether that be through physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse or psychological abuse. Self-victimization can also develop through codependent relationships we had with our parents, or simply by observing and adopting the unhealthy victim mentality exhibited by one or more of our family members.However, although what happens to us as children is completely beyond our control, it is our responsibility as adults to step into our power and reclaim responsibility for our happiness.9 Benefits of Being a VictimPlaying the victim actually has a number of juicy perks. These rewards make it very difficult to break out of such a mindset, which is why most victims seem to be so emotionally invested in perpetuating this type of toxic behavior.Some of the perks include the following:Not having to take responsibility for anythingOther people lavishing you with attentionOther people feeling sorry for youOther people are less likely to criticize or upset youYou have the “right” to complainYou’re more likely to get what you wantYou feel interesting because you get to tell people all of your storiesYou don’t have to feel bored because there’s too much drama going onYou get to avoid and bypass anger because you’re too busy feeling sadCan you see some underlying patterns starting to emerge here?Playing the victim actually gives you a lot of power: power to avoid responsibility, power to feel “righteously” sad and persecuted, power to avoid uncomfortable emotions, and power to manipulate other people.",-0.9947

Respectful disagreement should be understood as a legitimate, meaningful, and instructive intellectual outcome of any discussion. In these respects, the goal of class seminars and lectures is not to leave students with or convinced of the professor’s opinion. While the professor should feel free to express and defend their opinions, the goal should be to challenge students to think critically about opinions on all sides of issues on which people substantively disagree. Taking this approach toward open-mindedness, as the great American pragmatic philosopher, John Dewey suggests, “includes an active desire to listen to more sides than one; to give heed to facts from whatever source they come; to give full attention to alternative possibilities; to recognize the possibility of error even in the beliefs that are dearest to us.”I encourage all students and teachers to consider this approach precisely because it is one that aims to be charitable and compassionate toward any perspective from which we can gain insight and wisdom in our efforts at making a positive difference in the lives of others.",0.9948

Jewish settlements are concentrated in Area C, where Israel retains nearly exclusive control. Israeli negotiators have pressed to include the heavily settled areas as part of sovereign Israel under any peace agreement, with land swaps for the Palestinians elsewhere.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to extend Israeli sovereignty to all West Bank settlements as he sought votes ahead of national elections last year. He’ll face an unprecedented third vote in less than 12 months on March 2.The U.S. has strengthened his hand, with Secretary of State Michael Pompeo announcing in November that Israeli settlements in the West Bank aren’t inconsistent with international law, signaling a further shift away from established U.S. policy by the Trump administration.

Foreign Minister Israel Katz said he would work with foreign ministers of EU countries to prevent its implementation.""The ruling's entire objective is to single out and apply a double standard against Israel. There are over 200 ongoing territorial disputes across the world, yet the ECJ has not rendered a single ruling related to the labeling of products originating from these territories,"" the ministry said.Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian chief negotiator, welcomed the ruling and called on all EU countries to ""implement what is a legal and political obligation"".OBSTACLEPalestinians want to establish a",0.9826

But Highland Park should know better: Censorship is never a good look for a library.(May 30, 2019) Highland Park, NJ: The Central New Jersey chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace condemns the decision taken by the Highland Park Public Library to cancel the May 19th planned reading of the children’s book “P is for Palestine” by the author, Golbarg Bashi, Ph.D., a member of the Pace University faculty.Palestine Legal, ACLU-New Jersey and the Center for Constitutional Rights have joined Jewish Voice for Peace in condemning the censorship by the Highland Park Library.The Highland Park Library canceled the reading following a slanderous intimidation campaign by a Somerset County politician, who incorrectly alleged that the book promoted violence. In fact, P is for Palestine is a wonderful opportunity to share Palestinian culture with children, and deserves to be in the library’s collection. It was wrong for the Highland Park Library to censor stories of Palestinian experience by cancelling the scheduled book reading.JVP-Central New Jersey calls upon the library to reinstate the P is for Palestine event at a new date, in coordination with the original event organizers.The library has announced that the Highland Park Public Library’s Board of Trustees will determine if this children’s book event will be rescheduled at their June 5 meeting. JVP-Central New Jersey urges all concerned community members and media to attend the meeting (7:30pm, Highland Park Community Center 220 S 6th Ave) and ensure that the Library’s Board of Trustees recognizes that censorship is never a good look for a library.Palestinian stories deserve to be told.

Ilhan Omar is drawing criticism again for comments about Israel — this time suggesting that pro-Israel activists and lawmakers hold “allegiance to a foreign country.”In a lengthy and blistering rebuke late Friday, Rep. Eliot Engel, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Omar’s remarks amounted to a “vile anti-Semitic slur” and called on the Minnesota Democrat to apologize.. .“I welcome debate in Congress based on the merits of policy, but it’s unacceptable and deeply offensive to call into question the loyalty of fellow American citizens because of their political views, including support for the U.S.-Israel relationship,” said Engel (D-N.Y.), who is Jewish. “Her comments were outrageous and deeply hurtful, and I ask that she retract them, apologize, and commit to making her case on policy issues without resorting to attacks that have no place in the Foreign Affairs Committee or the House of Representatives.”Sign up here for POLITICO HuddleA daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

A spokesman for Omar did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Omar’s latest controversial comments come just a few weeks after she sparked a firestorm of criticism from her fellow Democrats over what they said was a similar anti-Semitic trope. Last month she implied on Twitter that lawmakers’ support for Israel was driven by campaign donations from the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, a prominent and influential pro-Israel group. She later apologized and deleted the tweets after House Democratic leaders released a joint statement condemning her remarks.Engel’s statement was in response to Omar’s appearance at an event in Washington earlier this week where she was lamenting that her criticisms of Israel are reflexively dismissed as anti-Semitic. Omar, who is Muslim, later said: “I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is O.K. for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.”While Omar has seen members of her own party turn on her amid the recent controversies, Republicans have been even more critical of her, with many calling on Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to kick her off of the Foreign Affairs Committee.

Coronato said that his office warned religious leaders two years ago about the risk of abusing financial assistance programs.“Financial assistance programs are designed to alleviate family hardships for those truly in need,” Coronato said. “Those who choose to ignore those warnings by seeking to illegally profit on the backs of taxpayers will pay the punitive price of their actions.”Al Della Fave, a spokesman for the prosecutor, said the meeting in 2015 with Lakewood religious leaders was meant to explain the application process for various financial assistance programs. He said the meetings were intended to inform the community about the potential “pitfalls” of what can be a confusing process and, also warn about the potential risks of providing false information.LAKEWOOD WELFARE RAIDSNEW: Hundreds attended Lakewood meeting warning of welfare fraud risk‘FAKE NEWS’?

Res. 496, a resolution “affirming that all Americans have the right to participate in boycotts in pursuit of civil and human rights at home and abroad.” My support of this resolution was a simple demonstration of my ongoing commitment to the ability of every American to exercise the fundamental First Amendment right to protest through nonviolent actions.As a young boy growing up in rural Alabama, the trajectory of my life changed when I heard the news of the Montgomery Bus Boycott on the radio. My support of these ideals simply affirms the constitutionally protected right to protest, enshrined by the First Amendment. It is not and was never meant to characterize opposition to boycotts as inherently unconstitutional.However, as a longtime friend of Israel and also as a cosponsor of H. Res. 246, the resolution “opposing efforts to delegitimize the State of Israel and the Global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel,” I want to make it very clear that I disagree strongly with the BDS movement. Economic, educational, and cultural interaction with Israel, America’s democratic ally, is not only in the best interest of Israelis and Americans, but it improves the climate for peace with Palestinians, which is in everyone’s interest to encourage. For these reasons, I was proud to be one of 398 members of the House of Representatives – an overwhelming bipartisan majority – who voted to pass H. Res. 246 on July 23, 2019. ###",0.9971

They focus on what they can control and they let go of everything outside of it. Like Agrippinus, like Walker Percy did, like you can if you put in the work. If you practice, if you rehearse, if you steel yourself for the fact that life inevitably will deliver these moments to us.Being exiled. Finding out you got fired.

Her moral anchor is firmly rooted in painful collective memories. Her mother survived a concentration camp and her father the ghettos of Romania and Ukraine. ""What luck my parents are dead,"" Hass wrote at the height of the Gaza operation in January. Her parents could not stand the noise of Israeli jet fighters flying over the Palestinian refugee camps in 1982, and nor could they have tolerated going about their daily chores in Tel Aviv with the knowledge of what was going on in their name in Gaza: ""They knew what it meant to close people behind barbed-wire fences in a small area.""

They can endure privation and have done so for hundreds of years in the past. The Chinese will simply wait out Trump and push back the Plan 2025 timeline a few years. A Trade War will massacre many countries/ economies. The blame will fall on the one who is perpetrating the tariffs. Over the longer term China will sign significant trade deals w/Europe (e.g. tech), South America (e.g. soybeans) and most Asian countries. They could stop importing U.S. oil, sell U.S. treasuries and U.S. stocks, and devalue their currency. All of that will be done quietly, behind the scenes, w/zero fanfare.

J Street national conference moderators challenged Democratic presidential candidates to get on board with this “new normal” last week.The organization self-describes as “pro-Israel, pro-peace,” and takes a more charitable approach to Palestinians than, for example, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC – read this and this), although many of J Street’s policy positions may be considered hawkish.J Street opposes the nonviolent BDS movement for justice, as well Palestinian efforts to gain a hearing at the International Criminal Court, and has apparently never supported calls to investigate Israel’s attempt to sink the USS Liberty.jeremy ben-ami, head of j streetJeremy Ben-AmiThe body’s stated mission is to “advocate for policies that advance shared US and Israeli interest,” a problematic claim, given that Israeli and US interests often diverge. In reality, when this is the case, Israeli needs almost always win out.Significantly, J Street’s pursuits do not consider Palestinian interests (except as they contribute to Israeli interests).Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of J Street, addressed the issue of aid at a press conference before the conference, revealing that the organization would push for the implementation of existing laws that stipulate how military aid may and may not be used (for example, the Leahy Laws). J Street does not favor a reduction in aid, which stands at $3.8 billion a year (and that costs Americans even more).",0.9918

Among the most damning accusations: — In addition to walking away from $2.6 million as a result of deals, the state appears to have aborted “hundreds” of cases of fraud perpetrated by Lakewood residents who missed last December’s amnesty deadline. — The top administrators at the comptroller’s Medicaid Fraud Division not only knew about the deal-making but endorsed the plan and signed off on every individual deal — all while keeping Comptroller Philip Degnan in the dark.

Over the past fortnight they have been looking and sounding even more smug than usual.The problem with Levy's analysis is that it assumes that Israel and the US wanted sanctions to bring about the fall of Hamas, either by giving Fatah the upper hand so that it could deal a knockout blow to the Palestinian government, or by inciting ordinary Palestinians to rise up and demand that their earlier electoral decision be reversed and Fatah reinstalled. In short, Levy, like most observers, assumes that the policy was designed to enforce regime change.But what if that was not the point of the sanctions? And if so, what goals were Israel and the US pursuing?The parallels between Iraq and Gaza may be instructive. After all, Iraq is the West's only other recent experiment in imposing sanctions to starve a nation. And we all know where it led: to an even deeper entrenchment of Saddam Hussein's rule.True, the circumstances in Iraq and Gaza are different: most Iraqis wanted Saddam out but had no way to effect change, while most Gazans wanted Hamas in and made it happen by voting for them in last year's elections. Nevertheless, it may be that the US and Israel drew a different lesson from the sanctions experience in Iraq.Whether intended or not, sanctions proved a very effective tool for destroying the internal bonds that held Iraqi society together. Destitution and hunger are powerful incentives to turn on one's neighbour as well as one's enemy. A society where resources -- food, medicines, water and electricity -- are in short supply is also a society where everyone looks out for himself. It is a society that, with a little prompting, can easily be made to te",-0.5621

Four times he resists God's call to lead the Israelites to freedom, until God finally gets angry with him (Ex. 3:1-4:7). More significantly, at the end of the parsha he says to God:""Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Why did You send me?

Even if Goldman just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem.

1010,"FOR ONCE A HONEST DEBATE ABOUT ISRAELJERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's foreign minister denounced Democratic front-runner Bernie Sanders on Wednesday for what he called his “horrifying comment"" about Jerusalem, saying that those who support Israel would not back Sanders' presidential candidacy after such remarks.At a contentious Democratic debate on Tuesday night in South Carolina, Sanders labeled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a ""reactionary racist"" and said he'd consider reversing President Donald Trump's move of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The move, following Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, outraged the Palestinians and led to a dramatic fallout with the U.S. administration.In a daring foray into American domestic politics, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said there was a not a Jew in the world who “hasn't dreamed of Jerusalem” and Sanders words were so severe that he had no choice but to retort.“We don't intervene in the internal American electoral process, which is splendid,” Katz told Israel's Army Radio, before noting that Sanders had a long history of attacking Israel and the things most sacred to its identity and national security.“Naturally, people who support Israel will not support someone who goes against these things,” he added.Sanders' comments at the debate came after he recently announced he would skip an appearance before the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC, which he called a “platform for bigotry.”He's also called for cutting back American foreign aid to Israel and redirecting it to the Palestinians instead. Sanders, who if elected would become America's first Jewish president, doubled down Tuesday saying: “What you cannot ignore is the suffering of the Palestinian people.”Sanders prefaced his remarks by saying he was “very proud of being Jewish,” and noted how he had volunteered in the 1960s on a socialist Israeli kibbutz, where he honed his leftist leanings. But his harsh criticism of modern-day Israeli policies, and embrace of supporters who have called for a boycott Israel, has raised great concerns in the Jewish state about his surging candidacy. Pro-Israel advocates have accused some of Sanders' prominent supporters of anti-Semitism.Sanders has firmly established himself in the lead after scoring primary and caucus victories in the first three nominating states: Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.Yair Lapid, a leading opposition figure who aims to replace Katz as foreign minister after next week's Israeli election, said in a recent TV interview that he was “very worried” about Sanders' rise because of his “lack of understanding of our unique situation in the Middle East.""The majority of American Jews vote Democrat and have been very critical of the Trump presidency.But in Israel, Trump has been warmly embraced by Netanyahu and his allies, which has contributed to undermining the decades-long traditional bi-partisan support Israel has enjoyed in the United States.Even so, Trump has remained very popular in Israel for backing it in a hostile region and delivering it a string of diplomatic achievements. Last month, Trump unveiled his much-anticipated Mideast plan to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It sided with Israel on most of its core demands and granted it sovereignty over large parts of the West Bank that the Palestinians seek for a future state.Previously, Trump reversed decades of Am",0.995

He said Georgia Southern hasn't yet seen the lawsuit.“Ms. Martin's concerns appear to be related to requirements of a state law enacted in 2016,"" Lester said in a statement.The law “requires that anyone who wants to contract with the state of Georgia for services worth more than $1,000 sign an oath pledging that they will not boycott the lsraeli government,"" said Edward Ahmed Mitchell, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations-Georgia.“That oath applies whether you are a substitute teacher who wants to work for our public school system, whether you are a construction worker who wants to build something for our state, or whether you are a journalist who wants to speak at a state university,"" Mitchell said.“Imagine if during the Civil Rights movement, the state of Alabama passed a law saying if you want to work for our state, you can not participate in the Montgomery bus boycott,” he added.Martin was to be paid a $1,000 honorarium plus expenses to be the keynote speaker for the 2020 International Critical Media Literacy Conference. So university officials asked her to sign a “Memorandum of Agreement"" which stated: “You certify that you are not currently engaged in, and agree for the duration of this agreement not to engage in, a boycott of Israel.""After Martin refused to sign, the university prevented her from speaking and the entire conference was cancelled, the lawsuit states.The law is similar to others passed in recent years in more than 20 states, including Texas, Arizona, Arkansas and Maryland, Mitchell said. His organization has been involved in fighting such laws nationwide,",0.9849

There is no political trick that will, as long as the Israeli government continues to deny the rights of three million people. The occupation is the single most important issue facing Palestinians and Israelis, and no amount of silencing will make it disappear. Only real lasting policy change can do that.Last year, the Israeli government revoked Shakir’s work permit, and demanded that he leave the country within two weeks. Their claim was that Shakir promotes boycotts of Israel, which, under a 2017 amendment to the “Entry to Israel” law, is now grounds to deny him entry to the country. If the courts uphold this law, it will make him the first person to be deported under it, and set a legal precedent.As part of its well-funded crusade against the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, The Ministry of the Strategic Affairs compiled a dossier against Shakir that cites tweets and petitions from over a decade ago, while he was a student at Stanford University in 2006.",-0.8994

But the U.S. was also in another dilemma. The Pentagon was also concerned the Israelis didn’t have the training to properly maintain the fighters if Washington delivered them.That meant in the case of a war, the U.S. would have to rush technicians to Israel to keep its American-supplied fighters in the air—“the worst possible political time for us to do so,” the memo stated. But if the U.S. delayed delivery for too long, reporters might find out and start asking uncomfortable questions about the reasons.In another memo, Paul Warnke—the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs—described Israel’s weapons program as constituting “the single most dangerous phenomenon in an area dangerous enough without nuclear weapons.”But Warnke was skeptical that cancelling the fighter deal would make much progress. Israel was only a few months away from finishing a nuclear weapon, and “would be unable and unwilling to put the genie back in the bottle.”Ultimately, Nixon didn’t cancel the fighter deal, and Israel went ahead and built the undeclared nuclear arsenal that exists today. The National Security Archives notes that the exact reasons why Nixon did not follow the advice of his Pentagon advisers is unclear. If documents exist showing why, the government hasn’t released them.It could be because of influence from the State Department, whose officials feared that public knowledge of Israeli nukes would scuttle peace negotiations. The diplomats favored a softer line and a “graduated approach” that would “begin with essentially persuasive tactics,” one State Department memo explained.There were also worried how the Soviet Union would react. If the open-secret became totally open, the State Department feared the Arab states would demand the Soviet Union supply them with nuclear material.

Ilhan Omar over her suggestion that pro-Israel lobbying groups hold undue sway over American policy because of their campaign contributions. ""Take it from this Benjamin: It’s not about the Benjamins!,” Netanyahu said in remarks via satellite to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which is holding it's policy conference in Washington this week.Netanyahu's jab at the newly elected congresswoman, one of only two Muslim women to ever serve in Congress, came in response to a tweet Omar posted in February about the influence of AIPAC. “It’s all about the Benjamins baby,” the Minnesota Democrat wrote, suggesting lawmakers were beholden to the group because of political money. Omar's comments sparked outrage within her own party and among Republicans, with critics slamming her comment as offensive and relying on anti-Semitic tropes. The House later passed a resolution condemning hate after Omar's remarks.In a remarkable exchange between a veteran foreign leader and a young American politician, Omar responded on Tuesday by highlighting Netanyahu's political troubles in Israel.

Some demonstrators hurled rocks at Israeli troops.""I came here because this is my land, and I want to die on my land but they are not letting me come near it,"" said Joudat Odeh, from Qusra.""They are happy at the victory of Netanyahu,"" said Odeh, 70. ""They are coming to control this land and we are helpless.""Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing Likud Party leads the vote count after Monday's election, but with 99% of votes counted on Wednesday he was still short of securing enough seats for a governing coalition.Victory would pave the way for Netanyahu to make good on his pledge to annex settlements in the West Bank under Trump's peace plan.Palestinians have rejected the proposal, saying it would kill their dream of establishing a viable state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, territory Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.More than 400,000 Israeli settlers now live among about 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank, with a further 200,000 settlers in East Jerusalem. Palestinians and much of the world view the settlements as illegal under international law, a position Israel and the United States dispute.An Israeli military statement said that on March 1 Israelis were carrying out ""agricultural work"" near Migdalim when around 30 Palestinians ""came to the area, hurled rocks and came into physical confrontation with the Israelis. Military forces came to the area and dispersed the crowd.""Soon afterwards, the statement said, 120 Palestini",0.986

Each is seeking a knock-out punch in the upcoming third round.Trump has delivered political favors to Netanyahu during the previous two races as well, only to see his friend fall short of victory.

The stubbornness of morality, of kindness, of Sinai and its basic commandments for our civilization (one of which has become particularly public and pertinent in our political and governmental lives) and of commitment to do the right and the just, is an admirable quality. Thus, a truly sophisticated and intelligent Jew is stubborn and flexible at the same time.

1204,"ALWAYS HOPE5. Your Rational Mind is Your Greatest AssetMarcus knew that our ability to reason is what sets us apart from the animals and is an important power that we must use to the fullest. He believed (like all Stoics) that our reason could be used to understand the universal reason present in nature, which would lead to agreement with it even if events seemed harmful. Our rational minds have complete power over our opinions and the mind only experiences suffering when it itself creates a desire for a specific outcome in life.Marcus—who had more control over his environment than most—was also the pen behind these lines: “You have power over your mind – not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”Marcus teaches that our mind is a thing that controls itself completely and is separated from the world; it cannot be affected by events unless it makes itself be affected. Every appearance is the result of what the mind wills it to appear to be and the mind makes itself exactly what it is. Since this is so, there is no reason we should not agree with nature, since nature has provided us with the means to rationally accept the course of events no matter where they take us.Three Key Tak",0.9899
1205,"Jay streetJ StreetEvery American opposed to a disastrous war with Iran needs to place a call to Congress today.Will you contact Representative Mikie Sherrill and Senators Robert Menendez and Cory A. Booker?Take Action »Dear Friend,Once again, the Trump administration has brought us to the brink of war with Iran.The assassination of Iran’s top military commander last night represents the latest and most significant in a series of escalatory steps by the Trump administration since its violation of the Iran nuclear deal.There is no debate that Soleimani was a malicious actor responsible for the deaths of thousands of people -- including Americans. But as with Trump’s Iran policy as a whole, this action was taken without consideration of consequences or overall strategy, absent congressional authorization and without the support of allies.We cannot predict what comes next. We can say that the risk of further escalation and the potential for a disastrous all-out war with Iran is as high as it’s ever been.So right now, it is vital that we flood Congress with calls demanding immediate action to prevent Trump from launching an unconstitutional war with Iran.Call Rep. Sherrill and Sens. Menendez and Booker right now >>The Constitution gives Congress, and only Congress, the power to declare war. That means that every representative and senator has a duty to make sure Trump is restrained from dragging the United States into military conflict without express authorization.And the public has a duty to make sure our representatives know where we stand: Adamantly opposed to another disastrous war of choice in the Middle East.There’s no time to waste. Please call Rep. Sherrill and Sens. Menendez and Booker today and ask them to do everything in their power to prevent Trump from dragging the US into war with Iran.Thank you,Dylan Williams",-0.9724

Their last aid bill failed – let's stop this one, too!Hi IAK Supporter,If it seems like every week brings new pro-Israel legislation in Congress, it's not your imagination. Over FIFTY new bills came up in 2019, and several more already in 2020!The newest, S.3176, would give Israel $38 billion over the next ten years as a minimum (it used to be the maximum). This works out to $7,230 per second!It is urgent for all of us to tell our Senators, ""enough""!TAKE ACTIONThe bill was introduced because last year's attempted legislation stalled and never became law. (My article explaining the new bill is here.)Giving this amount of money to a foreign country – while the US struggles financially – would be extravagant under the very best of circumstances. But $10 million per day to an apartheid regime that is in breach of multiple international laws every day is obscene.Israel has already caused too much damage – not just to Palestinians, but also to Iran, Lebanon, and Syria.

1240,"SABOTAGE!!!!!!!!Rightwing activists are attempting to spread new laws across Republican-controlled states that would ban criticism on public university campuses of Israel and its occupation of Palestinian territory.Related: Resigning MP claims Corbyn has failed to tackle Labour antisemitismPro-Israel and conservative lobbyists are encouraging state lawmakers to outlaw antisemitism in public education, from kindergarten through to graduate universities. But the proposed definition of antisemitism is so wide that, in addition to standard protections against hate speech towards Jews, it would also prohibit debate about the human rights violations of the Israeli government.First amendment advocates see the potential spread of such laws as a major threat to free speech on campuses.Among the activities that would be prohibited by the new laws are human rights investigations focusing specifically on Israel. Also banned would be any speech “demonizing Israel by … blaming Israel for all inter-religious or political tensions” or “delegitimizing Israel by … questioning Israel’s right to exist”.The push began at a conference in August held by the American Legislative Exchange Council, Alec, a conservative network which has a long history of propagating rightwing policies at state level through model bills. The group, dubbed a “bill mill”, has spearheaded attacks on trade unions, opposition to Obamacare, voter suppression measures and legislation blocking efforts to address the climate crisis.The meeting at Alec is disclosed in emails obtained under a freedom of information request by David Armiak, research director for the watchdog Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) and shared with the Guardian. They show that several Republican state lawmakers joined pro-Israeli lobbyists in Austin, Texas to discuss disseminating new restrictions on speech relating to Israel on campuses across the heartlands.The private meeting was led by Randy Fine, a Republican from Florida who was instrumental in passing in May the first state law outlawing antisemitism in public education. A week later he emailed fellow participants under the subject line: Anti-Semitism Bill Discussed at Alec.Fine has faced controversy in the past over his aggressive opposition to public debate about Israel. Earlier this year he called a local Jewish constituent a “Judenrat” because the man had attended a forum titled: Palestine/Israel, Opening the Dialogue.The term “Judenrat” was used in the second world war to castigate Jewish collaborators with the Nazis.Also attending the meeting at Alec were lawmakers from South Carolina, North Carolina, Arkansas, Kansas and Oklahoma, as well as representatives of two pro-Israel lobbying groups. “It was great to see you at the Alec conference last week in Austin and to briefly share the work we did",0.9892

This morning, President Trump attacked these members of Congress and tweeted that it would show “great weakness” if they were granted entry.We need to be clear about this: The unprecedented decision to ban sitting members of Congress -- the first two Muslim women in Congress -- is motivated purely by right-wing politics, not by the interests of the State of Israel. This is an affront to Congress and the American people and will do severe damage to the US-Israel relationship.Sign our petition: Reps. Omar and Tlaib MUST be allowed to travel to Israel and the West Bank >>As pro-Israel, pro-peace Americans, we know that strong democracies allow space for critical voices and scrutiny. We may disagree with the views that the members hold on questions such as BDS, or with Rep. Tlaib on the two-state solution, but the right approach for a state that values democracy is to welcome criticism and debate, not suppress it.Just two weeks ago, Israel’s ambassador to the US Ron Dermer said: ""Out of respect for the US Congress and the great alliance between Israel and America, we would not deny entry to any member of Congress into Israel.""Whatever changed since then has nothing to do with Israel’s security -- and everything to do with the far-right agenda of Trump and Netanyahu.Sign our petition and make clear: Pro-Israel, Pro-Peace Americans reject this disgraceful decision >>Thank you,Jeremy Ben-Ami,President of J Street",0.9671

Nor is there any sign that Pelosi will kick Omar off of the Foreign Affairs Committee, despite the anger of its pro-Israel chairman Representative Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.) and calls from Republicans and some Jewish groups for more than another meaningless apology.It’s obvious that Omar and Tlaib have taken the measure of their party’s leadership and decided that they have nothing to fear if they continue with their effort to delegitimize supporters of Israel.

Everyone know Volatility going to raise and so everyone try to exit similar time. That increase no of contract $XIV and other need to cover.Now here is where problem is. Normally they find big enough player to buy for 5-10% premium and so loss is very small. This time they haven't found anyone (I will put why in my contradiction theory). So they found buyer that wipeout 90% value overnight only and VIX jump because of this. Worst case scenario played out.Now My contradiction theory.Reason:-1.> Trade happen right at close. Which mean someone knew and ready with buy order of that size to match sell order so it quickly execute. 2.> It all most wipeout entire value but not gone negative of $SVXY & $XIV (Both endup with $4 NAV)3.> Bond market already reverse bigway main reason for market drop & so Market going to recover as well.4.> VIX unlikely remain that high, You need few billions and almost gureenteed profit. There are lot of big fishes out there and it consider peanut in today's market term.5.> Biggest holders said they have hedge and not suffer any losses.So What is my contradiction TheorySimple:- Trading revenue keep going down because volatility remain lower. This make harder for big firm like $GS, $JPM, $MS, $BAC,$C and other to make profit. So They plan entire event. First starting with Sell off and then determine exact price where inverse VIX wipe out. Knowing there is billion to make and yet finding buyer who only ready to buy at price that remove all most all equity on such fund everything is well planned and executed.Benefit:- 1.> Bring volatility back (Volatility Index double in seconds, Never happen before) This mean big player will make billions in trading.2.> Long term reason for low volatility gone. Since this index fund always gone up, lot of retail using as profit instrument and holding very long term. Now such fund not going to become big enough that it impact and run market volatility low.In other word Big player win big time.

For the lawmakers returning to work in Washington, a top priority must be taking action against the threat of Israeli annexation in the West Bank -- and in defense of the two-state solution.With the next Israeli election just weeks away, Prime Minister Netanyahu has repeatedly made clear that if re-elected, he will look to move forward with annexations in the West Bank. His government has been expanding settlements and displacing Palestinian communities at an alarming rate -- all with the goal of making the occupation permanent.What makes these plans so dangerous is that they seem to have the green light from the Trump administration. The White House has spent two years handing gifts to the Israeli far-right -- refusing to condemn settlement expansion, withdrawing support for the two-state solution and cutting all aid to the Palestinians.This week, the president told reporters that he might publish some parts of his so-called “peace plan” before the Israeli election -- and there’s good reason to fear that “plan” could include support for unilateral annexation.House Resolution 326 would draw a red line against these disastrous moves. The resolution makes clear that Congress opposes any action by the White House to encourage unilateral annexation of the West Bank or other steps which undermine the prospects for a two-state solution.Over 3/4 of House Democrats, including Representative Mikie Sherrill, co-sponsor this resolution -- now, leadership needs to make sure it gets brought to a vote.Take Action: Urge Rep.

A bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania, he wrote an article about how he wants to die by age 75 because life is not worth living past that point. He suggested other older Americans should consider “whether our consumption is worth our contribution.” He also wrote a piece in the New York Times encouraging Americans to “Skip Your Annual Physical.”Now, he appears to be promoting a plan that would deny the coronavirus vaccine to those most vulnerable to die from the virus: elderly Americans. A vaccine could be available within the next several months after two companies announced final testing on a coronavirus vaccine this fall.According to The Federalist:It’s not clear if that also would apply to Biden, who is about to turn 78.For years, Emanuel has written and talked about how life loses meaning after age 75. In a 2019 interview, he said only a “small number” of people live well in their 80s.“These people who live a vigorous life to 70, 80, 90 years of age — when I look at what those people ‘do,’ almost all of it is what I classify as play,” Emanuel said. “It’s not meaningful work. They’re riding motorcycles; they’re hiking. Which can all have value — don’t get me wrong. But if it’s the main thing in your life? Ummm, that’s not probably a meaningful life.”Health leaders and bioethicists have been warning about Emanuel’s anti-life philosophies for more than a decade. In 2009, Betsy McCaughey, a former chair of the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths and a former lieutenant governor of New York, wrote:As a bioethicist, he has written extensively about who should get medical care, who should decide, and whose life is worth saving.Dr. Emanuel is part of a school of thought that redefines a physician’s duty, insisting that it includes working for the greater good of society instead of focusing only on a patient’s needs. Many physicians find that view dangerous, and most Americans are likely to agree.According to Politico, Biden also is considering Emanuel as his secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.""...￼￼COPYRIGHT  2020ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.ABOUTADVERTISINGREPRINT",0.9952

1507,"TIMES CHANGINGWorldIsrael’s Arabs Are Having a Political MomentBloomberg Daniel Gordis,Bloomberg 34 minutes ago Reactions Reblog on Tumblr Share Tweet Email(Bloomberg Opinion) -- On Sept. 22, five days after Israel’s second round of 2019 elections, Ayman Odeh, who heads the consortium of Israeli Arab parties, tweeted in Hebrew a verse from the Book of Psalms (118:22). “The stone that the builders rejected,” he quoted, “has become the chief cornerstone.”The tweet was clever, for the playfulness it combined with the seriousness of its message. Muslim Israeli Arabs, for whom the Koran and not the Bible is a sacred text, do not often quote biblical verses. But Odeh’s tweet was meant to suggest that something had shifted in the political balance of power. “You have long rejected us in coalition negotiations,” the quote was widely understood to imply, “but now we have become the cornerstone.”No Israeli party has ever won 61 of the Knesset’s 120 seats, so every government has been a coalition of parties, each making its own demands for joining. This time, Benny Gantz of the new Blue and White centrist alliance won 33 seats, while Benjamin Netanyahu, the incumbent prime minister from the conservative Likud, had 32. Suddenly, the members of the Joint Arab List, which had won 13 seats (an increase of three from the previous election) saw themselves as potential power brokers. It was clear that to cobble together his own coalition, Netanyahu would need other right-wing parties, which would certainly not sit with the Arabs. But might Gantz?",0.9969

To date, Gaza’s Ministry of Health reports that Israeli soldiers have shot 50 men, women, and children in the eye since the weekly demonstrations began last March, leaving many permanently blind.by Tareq Hajjaj and Pam Bailey, reposted from TheNewArabMedia coverage and social media posts went wild when Palestinian photojournalist Muath Amarneh was blinded in his left eye after he was hit by a rubber bullet while covering a protest in the West Bank.However, Amarneh was far from unique; Israeli snipers targeting participants in Gaza’s weekly Great Return March protests have aimed for the legs – and eyes. To date, Gaza’s Ministry of Health reports that 50 protesters have been shot in the eye since the demonstrations began March 30, 2018 – leaving them permanently blind.“Some of these protesters and journalists were hit in the eye with teargas canisters, but most were targeted directly with what is commonly called a ‘rubber bullet,’ giving the impression they are somehow benign,” says Ashraf Alqedra, MD, a treating physician at Gaza City’s al-Shifa Hospital and spokesperson for the Ministry of Health.“But there is still steel at the core, and although these bullets don’t usually kill, they do grave damage. It is impossible to save an eye hit directly by a rubber-coated steel bullet.”However, he adds, due to the Israeli blockade, there are no artificial, glass eyes in Gaza – only a cosmetic improvement, but one that can be a significant psychological aid. These are available only by travelling out of Gaza for treatment and permits for such journeys are often not granted.According to data released by the World Health Organization, Gaza residents submitted 25,897 applications to travel via Erez Crossing to receive medical treatment in the West Bank or Israel; an average of 2,158 were submitted each month.

1609,"The common representation of Israel’s birth is that the UN created Israel, that the world was in favor of this move, and that the US governmental establishment supported it. All these assumptions are demonstrably incorrect.In reality, while the UN General Assembly recommended the creation of a Jewish state in part of Palestine, that recommendation was non-binding and never implemented by the Security Council.Second, the General Assembly passed that recommendation only after Israel proponents threatened and bribed numerous countries in order to gain a required two-thirds of votes.Alison WeirAlison Weir is executive director of If Americans Knew and president of the Council for the National Interest. See the “History of US-Israel Relations” for detailed citations for the above information. Additional references can be found in “How Palestine Became Israel.”Third, the US administration supported the recommendation out of domestic electoral considerations, and took this position over the strenuous objections of the State Department, the CIA, and the Pentagon.The passage of the General Assembly recommendation sparked increased violence in the region. Over the following months the armed wing of the pro-Israel movement, which had long been preparing for war, perpetrated a series of massacres and expulsions throughout Palestine, implementing a plan to clear the way for a majority-Jewish state.It was this armed aggression, and the ethnic cleansing of at least three-quarters of a million indigenous Palestinians, that created the Jewish state on land that had been 95 percent non-Jewish prior to Zionist immigration and that even after years of immigration remained 70 percent non-Jewish. And despite the shallow patina of legality its partisans extracted from the General Assembly, Israel was born over the opposition of American experts and of governments around the world, who opposed it on both pragmatic and moral grounds.Let us look at the specifics.",0.9629

Others are putting together a package of very low interest ( currently the legal allowed long-term annual rate is 1.17%) intra-family loans that let their children invest massive proceeds over their lifetime while still allowing their parents to retain the estate tax exemptions and either convert the loans to a gift later as the tax situation clarifies out simply wait out DEM control of Congress and the Presidency for however many years it takes.

Pro-Israel organizations would rather believe outrageous fallacies than stand up for these kids’ rights.by Kathryn ShihadahImagine a country that arrests hundreds of children every year, tortures many of them, and forces them to sign confessions they can’t read. Imagine that the United States provides billions of dollars in free aid to this country.Now imagine a Congressperson demanding better oversight of aid to that country, to assure that American taxpayer dollars are not spent in support of these practices. Would lawmakers line up to support such legislation? Would anyone with a conscience not want to protect those children?There is a country that arrests and tortures children – Israel – and it receives $3.8 billion in aid from the US every year. Israel uses much of that money to fund its prison system and military courts that abuse Palestinian children.Legislation before Congress seeks to control the use of our aid to that country – not to end the aid, just to forbid its use against children. But Congress members are not lining up to support the bill, and some organizations are pushing very hard to keep it that way.Each year the Israeli military arrests and prosecutes around 700 Palestinian children. Help us end this.No Way To Treat a ChildAdvocates of justice for Palestinians believe the recent bill from Congresswoman Betty McCollum (D-MN-4) sets a comfortably low bar. Its mandate is simple: US taxpayer dollars should not fund the incarceration and torture of children.H.R.2407, nicknamed No Way To Treat a Child (NWTTAC – official website here, background here), reads, in part:The Government of Israel and its military detains around 500 to 700 Palestinian children between the ages of 12 and 17 each year and prosecutes them before a military court system that lacks basic and fundamental guarantees of due process in violation of international standards.Since 2000, more than 10,000 Palestinian children have been subject to the Israeli military court system.The bill cites reports by three United Nations organizations, three respected NGOs, and the US State Department. The research is unanimous in its conclusion: Israel is in breach of international law in its treatment of Palestinian children. Here are some of their most conspicuous findings:United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) reveals, “ill-treatment of children who come in contact with the [Israeli] military detention system appears to be widespread, systematic and institutionalized throughout the process…in no other country are children systematically tried by juvenile military courts that, by definition, fall short of providing the necessary guarantees to ensure respect for their rights.” United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) also reports “degrading treatment, and often to acts of torture.”Human Rights Watch (HRW) discusses Israeli soldiers’ use of “chokeholds and beatings” on children as young as eleven.The US State Department reported in 2013 that many of the children arrested are accused of stone-throwing (an offense that can carry a sentence of up to twenty years if the perpetrator is Palestinian), and that “signed confessions by Palestinian minors, written in Hebrew, a language most could not read, continued to be used as evidence against them in Israeli military courts.”Defense for Children International – Palestine (DCIP) interviewed over 700 child detainees, and found that 73% had endured physical violence and 96% had no parent present during their interrogation.H.R.2407 is one of dozens of bills addressing the needs of vulnerable children: 232 out of 435 Congress members cosponsored H.R.6, the American Dream and Promise Act; H.R.541 and S.292, the Keep Families Together Acts (against separating parents and children at our southern border) have 202 and 41 cosponsors, respectively.One might expect that H.R.2407 would also receive broad support – especially since it echoes another law already on the books since 1961. Under normal circumstances, protecting children from abuse and torture would be a legislative no-brainer.But support for Palestinian justice – even Palestinian children’s justice – is distinctly unpopular. McCollum’s bill has just 23 cosponsors; there were more, but several Congress members – Rep. Rosa DeLauro [D-CT-3] and Rep. Debbie Dingell [D-MI-12] – removed their names.Legislation protecting Israel from criticism, on the other hand, has enjoyed broad support. For example, H.Res.246 garnered 351 cosponsors before passing the House – even though the bill is almost certainly unconstitutional. (Read about other pro-Israel legislation he",0.993

1681,"CHICKENS COMING HOME TO ROOSTOne of the oldest clichés in politics is you can fool all of the people for only some of the time. There will come a point where all of the people, collectively the markets, wake up to state-sponsored statistical fraud. With price inflation appearing to accelerate, public apathy over price inflation will be replaced by a substantial and possibly sudden adjustment to money-preferences relative to goods.The timing of an economic awakening is likely to be linked to the credit cycle, when public support for reflationary actions evolves from complacency to sudden concern. It is one thing to tolerate government intervention when things appear to be going reasonably well or there is a prospect of it succeeding, but when the economy runs into trouble a different mood prevails. If the recent economic slowdown gathers pace public psychology will make that change.I have argued in other Insight articles that the combination of trade protectionism and the end of the expansionary phase of the credit cycle is a lethal economic combination.[iii] The empirical evidence from the 1929-32 episode could not be clearer. At that time, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act coincided with the top of the 1920s credit cycle. Through its trade policy, the US Government is imposing the same conditions today that led to the Great Depression in the 1930s. This time the same combination is being applied with the dollar as reserve currency, backed only by what will become the diminishing faith in and credit of the US Government. And we will then face the prospect of a further acceleration of money-printing in the form of QE.Assuming the conditions of the 1929-32 Wall Street crash are being only half-replicated, US Government funding requirements will go through the roof. Under the guise of bailing out a deteriorating economy, it is clear that the US Government will not cut its spending. We are seeing a well-established maxim being proved, and that is no government with a fiat currency can resist resorting to the printing press.The foreign dimension is changing things for the worseThe most inflationary funding mechanism is for one government department (the treasury) to issue bonds to the public and the banks, and another government department (the central bank) to buy them off the public and the banks by issuing raw currency. So as to not raise inflationary suspicions, this overtly inflationary mechanism is called quantitative easing and it is set to return big-time.So far, QE has covered only part of the US Government’s funding requirement since the Lehman crisis. The full breakdown is shown in the following table, which incorporates both long-term and short-term debt.",-0.9744

While the investigation is ongoing, and no definitive action is expected to be taken either to indict nor exonerate the prime minister fully, the investigation has piqued the interest of Israelis and the global populace alike. Garnering instant attention from international media, the Israeli chief of police claimed that his department has acquired sufficient evidence of corruption to indict Prime Minister Netanyahu if Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit deem such action necessary.

1721,"ISRAEL MUST BE SAVED FROM ITSELFEven more troubling, Netanyahu’s victory over the judicial system is astounding. The majority of voters – according to current results – voted for a man set to go on trial in a few weeks. It’s as of voters didn’t care or do not trust the judiciary. Since Netanyahu is determined to evade justice, it seems like the country is facing a constitutional crisis of a new scale.For more than a year, Israel has been in an intractable political deadlock. When the last election’s result were published in September, giving Netanyahu’s party only 32 seats, many of us were sure that this is the end of Bibi and his extreme-right government. Now, it is clear that the celebrations were too hasty. Like the coyote that always returns to chase the roadrunner, no matter how deep he fell just a moment ago, Netanyahu shows a remarkable ability to recover from any political and legal setbacks. Even in his own party, some said that one cannot be a prime-minister and sit on the accused bench at the same time. The third round of elections proved the opposite: Rumpelstiltskin turned hay into gold, and Netanyahu did even better, turning legal accusations into parliament seats.What motivated so many Israelis to vote for a man accused of bribery? The answer is far deeper than Netanyahu himself. It has to do with the lack of trust among vast groups in Israeli society, who doubt the country’s justice system. If you ask someone in the streets of Jerusalem to picture a judge, you’re likely to get a description of a white, upper-class secular man – “a lefty”. Many voters of Netanyahu’s party share the opposite demographic profile. A map of voters who supported Netanyahu show most of them come from lower socioeconomic background, and keep Jewish traditions. They are not part of the hated “Ashkenazi elite.” They’ve experienced inequality. For them, the dice are indeed loaded. And so, when Netanyahu says that in his case the dice are loaded and claims the game was fixed–they believe him. Ironically, it was the decision to prosecute Netanyahu after so many years of investigation that convinced many people in the public that he was prosecuted due to his beliefs.To understand Netanyahu’s remarkable achievement is to dive into the deep water of inequality, where hate between groups prevails all other arguments. I’m writing this from my table in a coffee house in Tel Aviv. Costumers walk inside sad faced, holding today’s papers, or surfing news-portals. Strangers tell each other “he did it again”. Tel Aviv is referred to sometime as “a state of its own”, and it’s easy to tell why. The numbers are clear: Tel Aviv and the surrounding suburbs voted central-left. Lower socio-economic cities such as Beer Sheba and Tiberius voted Bibi. Even more than they like Netanyahu, they hate the elite, those liberal left-wing attorneys and judges who went to top universities and grew up in rich families.During his campaign, Netanyahu has called the prosecution against him “an attempted coup,” implying the justice legal system is infected with political interests. He calls it a witch hunt, but the real witch hunt is the one that the legal system is now undergoing, with Bibi’s followers sending death threats to state attorneys and other professionals who are part of the investigation. As the Prime Minister calls to “investigate the investigators,” the accusations against him are now viewed by some as an attack against the entire right wing political movement, while the left is allegedly using the justice system to try and win over the country. The accusations of bribery do not make those supporters doubt Netanyahu’s integrity. Instead, they doubt the integrity of the legal system. Nothing could be further from the truth – but the truth is no longer part of this election.Right-wingers have already called",0.9607

This gave an American-Israeli energy corporation a prime directorate in deciding on who to put into power, who would oversee national security policies and ultimately be in a position to pick favorable people to pursue their objectives. This represents a rather grave conflict of interest, as Ira Greenstein was by all accounts also still the President of Genie Energy* when the U.S. attacked Syria and given his role within the White House as a Deputy Assistant and high-level Strategist akin to former Chief Strategist Steve Bannon may have directly contributed to pushing for military action himself.The White House would’ve been aware of this issue, yet as numerous members of the Trump administration were cut, employment of this individual continued. Why?Moreover, Greenstein’s position is itself a conflict of interest by default, per 18 U.S.C. § 208. This is in regards to ‘Employees Entering Government,’ because incurred losses in Syria by U.S. military action inherently benefits Genie Energy or its larger parent company IDT Corporation, as only the legal Syrian government can or will dissent to the corporation’s Israeli-backed but nonetheless private activities in occupied Syrian territory. This key issue is also escalated due to Greenstein overseeing national security or other positions with Kushner directly, which invariably affected the decision making process, of whether to attack Syria or not. His relationship through Kushner to Trump must also be taken into con",0.8583

That’s the same position he was in both before and after the first two elections of the past year. In some ways, we’re right back where we started.The bad news: Even with Netanyahu on the brink of standing trial for corruption, his opponents were unable to deliver a political knockout blow. That means that, whether he succeeds in forming a government, whether his opponents somehow manage to form a government or whether Israel heads to an astounding fourth election, he likely will remain in power as prime minister for at least the next few months.It means that the chances are still very high that, with a green light from President Trump and in coordination with Ambassador Friedman, Netanyahu will take steps at some point in the coming weeks to advance illegal, unilateral annexations of Palestinian territory in the West Bank.That’s why our work leading the fight against annexation is now more important than ever. It’s why we’re pushing Congress, presidential candidates and Jewish leaders across the country to stand up against annexation and settlement expansion. It’s why we’re leading a campaign to make sure the Democratic platform commits to supporting Israeli security AND opposing the occupation.And it’s why we’re reaching out to ask for your support to make sure that we succeed.

A fictional caper about an antiquities heist set Petra has stirred widespread outrage over the film’s portrayal of historical Jewish ties to Jordan, shining a light on the tenuous peace with neighboring Israel and prompting the government to suspend the movie’s production. “Jaber” follows a Jordanian boy who uncovers a stone with a Hebrew inscription on it in the rose-colored, rock-hewn city of Petra. (AP Photo/Sam McNeil, File)RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — A fictional caper about an antiquities heist set in an ancient Jordanian city has stirred widespread outrage over the film's portrayal of historical Jewish ties to Jordan, shining a light on the tenuous peace with neighboring Israel and prompting the government to suspend the movie's production.Based on a book of the same name, the movie, ""Jaber,"" follows a Jordanian boy who uncovers a stone in the rose-colored, rock-hewn city of Petra with a Hebrew inscription on it. He sets off to sell it to the highest bidder, but interested parties in Israel catch wind of the find, dispatching a Russian organized crime group to pursue the boy and retrieve the stone at any cost.Opponents of the film say merely discussing a historical Jewish presence in Jordan could open the door to Israeli territorial claims to the Hashemite Kingdom. They point to Israel's claims over the West Bank and east Jerusalem — war-won territories sought by the Palestinians — which Israel says are rooted in millennia-old Jewish ties, backed up by archaeological finds.While such a scenario is unlikely in Jordan, the concerns reflect the hostility Jordanians feel toward Israel despite the two countries' 1994 peace agreement.""Any talk about Jewish history in Jordan could lead to political claims,"" said Ali Elayan, who was slated to play a Jordanian police officer in the movie but withdrew over his opposition to the plot. ""That is what happened in Palestine.""Israel captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem, then under Jordanian control, in the 1967 Mideast war. Spurred on by religious Jews hoping to restore a Jewish presence in the biblical land of Israel, repeated Israeli governments have erected settlements in the territories that are widely seen as obstacles to the establishment of a viable Palestinian state. The Palestinians seek the West Bank for their future state, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.Since signing the landmark peace accord, Israel and Jordan have developed low-key yet strategic ties on energy, water and security. But the relationship has been tested in recent years. Last year, Jordan's King Abdullah II decided not to renew parts of the peace deal regarding access to farming land. And two years ago, a diplomatic crisis was sparked when a guard at the Israeli Embassy in Amman opened fire after he said he was attacked with a screw driver, killing two Jordanians. Israel swapped out its ambassador to the kingdom and expressed ""deep regret"" over the incident. The guard, who claimed self-defense, received a hero's welcome in Israel, infuriating the Jordanians.Israel's Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the controversy surrounding the film.While there is ample archaeological evidence of a Jewish presence in Jordan, only an extreme-right fringe of Israeli society seeks both banks of the Jordan River as part of Israel. An overwhelming majority of Israelis make no claim to Jordanian land and place high value on the peace accord.Ordinary Jordanians — many of whom are Palestinian refugees or have ties to Palestinians — view Israel with animosity.The movie was set to begin filming this month when actors began dropping out over the script and taking to social media to air their criticisms, sparking a public outcry. Seizing on the wave of public opinion against the movie, the government demanded that the director, Muhyiedeen Qandour, halt filming until an official commission studies the script and delivers recommendations on it. It is unclear how long that may take.Qandour told The Associated Press that the film bears no political undertones. He rejected criticism that it invites Israeli territorial claims.""Many civilizations passed through historical Jordan. You don't see them now returning to claim parts of the country because they were here once in the past,"" he said. ""The argument made by some about the movie is simply naive and even childish.""But opponents are still skeptical.""We are not against Jews as Jews but we are against Israel as an occupying power which uses religion to take others' land,"" said Sari al-Asaad, the former head of the Jordanian Actors Association, who opposed the movie and lobbied to derail it.",-0.9684

How did you know I’m a Jew?’” Yankel told Newsweek.“I’m glad they used that name,” Yankel says as he and his wife of 42 years relax on the expansive porch of their Bloomingburg home, which is not in Chestnut Ridge. “It’s a lot kinder than I’ve heard before.”For the backers of Chestnut Ridge, stories like Yankel’s demonstrate that opposition to the project is rooted in anti-Semitism. On September 8, 2014 the project’s developers and several Hasidic residents of Bloomingburg filed a $25 million civil rights lawsuit against the village and the town of Mamakating, alleging that nobody in Bloomingburg had a problem with Chestnut Ridge until false rumors circulated in the summer of 2012 that the development is exclusively for Hasidim. (An ad for Chestnut Ridge which ran October 7 in the Times Herald-Record newspaper, which covers the Hudson Valley including Bloomingburg, does boast that neighborhood amenities include “houses of prayer and institutions, including a synagogue, post-marriage learning center and spas”—alongside a house-shaped graphic with the words “equal housing opportunity.”)SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSIGN UPUpdate your preferences »Residents have honked and hurled coffee cups at Hasidim, the lawsuit charges.

We haven’t taken a hard line.”Instead of taking a rigid political position, #IfNotNow has taken a much more human outlook than most groups. They call on the leaders of major Jewish institutions to stop supporting the ongoing military onslaught that is taking Palestinian and Israeli lives. They make this in their open letter which was recited in their action on Monday. The letter speaks of their grief for the amount of loss that has happened to Palestinians, and the needless loss of Israelis that have been fighting in Gaza. They recognize the immense inequality Palestinians face. They say that they are, “Outraged that so many speak of Palestinians as if their lives were worth less than our own, outraged at the justifications offered for the killing of so many.” They “reject the view that ‘we have no choice,’ that this violence is necessary and inevitable.”#IfNotNow members are standing up as Jews to oppose the war and occupation, and to mourn the immense loss, as Shapiro said, “in a Jewish way that seems important at a time like this.” They are part of a movement of trailblazers who are not only recognizing the humanity surrounding the conflict, but also rejecting the narrative being repeated by many, and advocating that occupation and the dehumanization of Palestinians must end in order for there to be peace, freedom, and dignity for all who reside in Israel and Palestine.",-0.9784

Schneerson, of righteous memory, taught deeply and passionately of the impact the act of blessing has on our interpersonal relationships – helping us to discover and focus on the inherent goodness contained in every single person, and of the tangibly transformative effect the blessings have on each recipient, on the one who offers blessing, and on the entire universe.",0.9964

1999,"commandment""Love your neighbor"" is the universal Golden Rule, which the Talmud defines as a ""great principle"" of Judaism. 1 How we treat others is a litmus test of our spiritual health. Since God is the ultimate ""giver,"" 2 our pursuit of Godliness is driven by acts of giving. 3When I give, I become more embracing and inclusive of the world. I expand my ""personal investment portfolio"" of the people I've helped. Seeing that bit of self in another attaches me emotionally and endears me to them. In this way, the giving actually leads to love. 4This is the Kindness Paradox: the biggest beneficiary of kindness is the one performing it. (That's why parents love their children most of all; it is their greatest investment.) Significantly, the Hebrew word for “give” – hav – is the etymological root of ahava, meaning “love.” 5",0.9923

2010,"HUMAN LIFE THE FIRST PRIORITYe second source, preferred by the 13th century sage Nahmanides, is also from Leviticus: “the stranger and the citizen shall live with you.” According to the Talmud, this verse tells us that we have a positive commandment to preserve life, even if it means violating other ritual or ethical commandments. As opposed to being a built-in exception to every commandment, this source tells us that saving lives is a positive commandment on its own.Nahmanides is clear that this applies to gentiles as well as Jews. We are all human beings created in the image of God. Whether Jewish or not, citizen or stranger, the commandment of saving a life is preeminent.This community-minded understanding of pikuach nefesh teaches us that not only are we to celebrate mitzvot as affirming of our creation in the image of God, but also as vehicles to affirm that others are created in the image of God as well. Our tradition aims to create a society which celebrates the creation of all of humanity. Nahmanides’ interpretation ask us: Are we creating a society on the principles of pikuach nefesh, where everyone is looking out for the life, safety and well-being of the “stranger and the citizen” around us?Of course, nothing in Judaism is so simple – nor should it be. So there are exceptions to pikuach nefesh. The Talmud tells us that a person cannot kill another person to save their own life. Adultery and idolatry are also excluded; according to most authorities, a person must give up their life rather than violating these prohibitions. The Talmud also tells us that if the violation would be public — and especially if it’s a time when the ruling authorities are seeking to get Jews to violate the Torah’s commandments — you must give up your life rather than commit even the smallest infraction.There is one other important exception to saving life as declared by Rabbi Akiva: If the choice is between saving your own life or someone else’s, save your own first. If you are in the desert and have only one bottle of water, and you need it all to survive, drink the water — even if it means your friend gets stuck without any water and dies.All of this was hotly debated in the medieval period because the basic idea of never having a commandment come at the expense of human life was so central. Our tradition just cannot conceive of it in a normal world. In the late Middle Ages, Rabbi Menachem Meiri said that while the Talmud seemed to exclude many non-Jews from the laws of pikuach nefesh, had it known of the civilized societies of Meiri’s era (and ours), it would have been more explicit that everyone living in civilized society, Jew or non-Jew, is covered by the law of pikuach nefesh. Their lives must be saved, e",0.9978

The event was then postponed and rescheduled.BDS stand for ""Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions."" The BDS movement works to end international support for Israel's oppression of Palestinians and pressure Israel to comply with international law, according to the definition on the Zachor Legal Institute's website.Recently, the institute sent a letter to the borough and library informing them that the groups supporting the reading promote anti-Semitism and since the library apparently receives federal funding, it could be in violation of the anti-discrimination provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race and national origin, said Marc Greensdorfer of the Zachor Legal Institute.""The purpose of our letter was not to threaten litigation; rather, it was to inform the city/library that they were being used by groups promoting discrimination with a request that they do their due diligence on the parties involved,"" Greensdorfer said.

Mr Netanyahu was holding a campaign rally at the time and was forced to flee the stage.Stephane Dujarric, a UN spokesperson, said that any Israeli move to impose its administration over the Palestinian territory would be illegal under international law.“Such a prospect would be devastating to the potential of reviving negotiations, regional peace, and the very essence of a two-state solution,” he added.The plan sparked fury among Palestinian and Arab leaders, with the Arab League condemning Mr Netanyahu’s remarks as “Israeli aggression” that, if carried out, amounts to “an Israeli declaration for the end of the peace process”.Saudi Arabia described the election promise as a “blatant violation” of international law and an “extremely dangerous escalation”.Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, echoed Riyadh’s strong condemnation, saying the move would fan the flames of conflict around the region.Turkey, meanwhile, said the “illegal, unlawful and aggressive” move proved Israel was a “racist apartheid state”.",0.8335

One who is complicit is said to be an accomplice. But, even though an accomplice does not actually commit the crime, his or her actions helped someone in the commission of the crime.The concept of accomplice liability means an accomplice faces the same degree of guilt and punishment as the individual who committed the crime. Indeed, accomplices can face the same penalties, including prison time. The key consideration is whether the individual intentionally and voluntarily encouraged or assisted in the commission of the crime, or (in some cases) failed to prevent it.Elements of Accomplice LiabilityWhile it varies by state, a prosecutor typically must be able to prove the following four elements to convict someone of being an accomplice or aiding and abetting:A crime was committed by another individual;The defendant ""aided, counseled, commanded, or encouraged"" the other person in the commission of the crime.The defendant acted with the requisite mental state in their jurisdiction, for example, knowingly or purposefully, to assist in the crime.Examples of ComplicityThe following examples illustrate the many ways an individual may be an accomplice to a criminal act:Serving as the getaway driver in a bank robbery.Turning off the alarm system of a jewelry store in which you work, knowing that it will be robbed later that evening.Loaning a handgun to someone who you know is planning to commit a crime.Directing a vehicle to a dead-end street where you know an armed carjacker is waiting.The Difference Between Complicity and Conspiracy",-0.9882

2096,"RIGHT ONJ StreetFriend, If there was ever any doubt that the Trump-Netanyahu “peace plan” was anything other than a smokescreen for annexation, it was removed just moments after President Trump stepped aside from the podium at the White House yesterday.When Prime Minister Netanyahu took the mic, he announced that he would immediately take action to annex all West Bank settlements as well as the Jordan Valley, claiming he had the Trump administration’s full support to do so -- a claim US Ambassador David Friedman backed up a few minutes later. Now, you might have heard about the mountains of cash promised to Palestinians if they embrace the so-called deal. About a “freeze” on Israeli settlements and a pathway to statehood for Palestinians. I want to be very clear, this plan is full of misleading language designed to mask its true intention: the legitimization of illegal, unilateral West Bank annexation.On almost every issue, rather than proposing workable compromises, the plan continuously and disingenuously seeks to redefine the substance of final-status issues, to a point that is downright Orwellian. None of this does anything to move the region closer to peace and stability, or to guarantee Israel’s long-term security as a democratic state and a homeland for the Jewish people.Here are some key takeaways about the plan to illustrate that point:It’s a two-state solution in name only. The Palestinian ""state"" proposed by the plan is actually an archipelago of enclaves and islands of territory surrounded by Israel. The Israeli military would continue to control all airspace, ports, territorial waters and borders indefinitely. The document itself even attempts to redefine sovereignty as an “amorphous concept” which has become an “unnecessary stumbling block.”The plan describes a vision of indefinite occupation. Even if Palestinians submit to every requirement under the proposal, the Israeli government must only commit to “minimize” its military occupation of Palestinian territory. At any time, and at its sole discretion, the Israeli military is permitted increase its footprint across any and all of the Palestinian territory. This is not different in any meaningful way from the current situation.The promise of a Palestinian capital in “Eastern Jerusalem” is completely hollow. In reality, the plan grants Israel the authority to retain control over the entirety of Jerusalem, including Arab neighborhoods in what is currently referred to as East Jerusalem. The Palestinian “Eastern Jerusalem” capital the plan proposes consists of small, far-flung, disconnected neighborhoods beyond the current separation wall.There is no settlement freeze. While Trump’s announcement alluded to some kind of freeze in Israeli settlement construction, the plan is almost precisely the opposite. Under the terms of the plan, Israel is granted sovereignty over all existing settlements, where it can continue building as much as it wants. It only commits to not building settlements on enclaves of PA-controlled territory where no settlements currently exist.The proposed ‘land swaps’ are not comparable. In exchange for giving vast, geographically vital portions of the occupied West Bank to Israel, the plan offers to give Palestinians areas of Israel that are mostly desert and are almost entirely disconnected from the rest of their “state.”The plan is clearly designed to elicit Palestinian rejection. As if it wasn’t clear enough from the content of the plan and the fact that the authors haven’t spoken to a Palestinian representative in over two years, the plan also includes several additional poison pills which ensure it will never be viable. Israel is only compelled to fulfill its obligations under the deal if Gaza is fully controlled by another entity approved by Israel. There is total rejection of even a tiny, symbolic number of Palestinian refugees being allowed to return to live inside Israel. The plan also floats the idea of transferring Israel’s “Triangle Communities,” home to roughly 300,000 Palestinian citizens of Israel, to the Palestinian “state,” a plan pushed for in the past by Israel’s far-right former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman as a means of decreasing Israel’s Arab population.On issue after issue, the Trump-Netanyahu proposal falls far short of UN resolutions, previous agreements between the Israelis and Palestinians and decades of bipartisan American foreign policy. This is a cynical proposal designed to shift the baseline of US foreign policy and greenlight immediate annexation.We can’t let the Trump administration get away with it.Please join J Street members across the country and tell Congress to reject Trump's peace sham >>>We’ll have more to say on this in the coming days and weeks, and are committed to mobilizing the pro-Israel, pro-peace movement to fight back.

2097,"The issue of buying at ""All Time High"". Never before, entering the stock market was easier. All it takes is five minutes and an ID, that’s it. Easy. The difficulties appear as soon as you want to buy a stock. If the company is in shape, the stock price will be in more than 80% of all cases on its “all time high” – so utterly expensive. A thought experiment: If you buy today at the highest price and the stock continues to rise, from a future perspective you can say, you haven't bought at the ""all time high"", but on average. The problem is not the price, but a psychological one. It is due to the term: ""All time"" is equal to ""All in"". So, is it time that people commit to new ways of stock price rating? An example: One approach is to establish a kind of Publicity-Index. A number that conducts an index by the amount of news going around for that company. To obtain that the index also needs to reflect the positive and negative news value. Thus, in the future, another value could emerge in addition to the P/E ratio: the P index.

For wildly different reasons, some of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's supporters aren't happy with how things are shaping up, either, despite initially reacting positively to the proposal, The Washington Post reports.White House adviser and President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has received a lot of the blame, particularly when it comes to the delay in annexation of Jewish settlements. David Elhayani, the leader of the Yesha Council, which oversees more than 150 Israeli settlements, said Kushner ""took a knife and put it in Netanyahu's back"" when Washington didn't follow through on a reported promise to allow Israel to declare sovereignty over 30 percent in the West Bank if Palestine didn't accept the plan within 48 hours.In the end, Palestine flat out rejected the plan, but the U.S. urged patience when it came to annexation, with Kushner suggesting Israel wait to consider the motion until a new government is formed after next month's elections. But Elhayani thinks the annexation pause could actually cost Netanyahu an electoral victory. In that scenario, he said, the annexation plan he hopes to see would likely flounder in Israel's future parliament.

The fact that he was recently indicted on three counts of fraud, bribery and breach of trust merely confirms their dire view of him. On the other side, Likud voters regard the Blue and White crowd as snobs. Likudniks and their allies tend to be Sephardic, religiously orthodox, blue-collar and resentful of the mainstream media. They are not troubled by the prime minister’s legal issues and insist they will stand by their man. Under Israeli law, an indicted prime minister can continue to serve while being tried. If the Jerusalem district court eventually convicts him, he can hold on to power while the case goes on appeal to the Supreme Court. Given the slow pace of criminal trials, and the quality of his legal team, this could take years. Most leaders wouldn’t want to put themselves or their country through such an ordeal; Netanyahu, having long ago concluded that he is a man of destiny, will try to keep his job by any means necessary. His best hope to get to the magic 61 seats in March is to bring out a large Likud-bloc vote on election day. The traditional means of achieving this a rhetorical offensive against the growing influence of the anti-Zionist Arab party, known as the Joint List. Netanyahu deployed this tactic in the two previous elections, but it didn’t bring out his voters the sufficient numbers.

2168,"A REAL NEGATIVE FOR ISRAELWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives passed a symbolic resolution on Friday backing a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, following initiatives from President Donald Trump seen as heavily favoring the Jewish state.The Democratic-led House voted 226 to 188, largely along party lines, for a non-binding resolution saying that only a two-state solution can both ensure Israel's survival as a Jewish state and fulfill the Palestinians' ""legitimate aspirations"" for their own state.Since he became president in January 2017, the Republican Trump has been condemned by Palestinian and some Arab states' leaders for reversing long-held U.S. policies to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital in 2017, move the U.S. embassy to the city in 2018 and cut U.S. aid to Palestinians.In March 2019, Trump recognized Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in 1967. And last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington would no longer consider Israeli settlements in the West Bank to be illegal.Such measures, which help strengthen support for Trump from his conservative evangelical Christian political base, have fueled questions about whether his administration will abandon the idea of a ""two-state solution,"" with an independent Palestinian state living side-by-side with Israel.

Even Arab states that are described as moderate are not able to openly express support for it.”The plan is being similarly dismissed in Israel. As diplomatic correspondent Noa Landau notes in the Israeli publication Haaretz (paywall), “The so-called ‘deal of the century’ is jumping a hundred steps ahead some have said [about] the Americans’ colorful printed proposal.” But she argues that this is “precisely the intention” and “there is no point analyzing it from too pragmatic a perspective.” Kushner’s deal is about a “vision” for Palestinians, she writes.That much is true. The plan provides a picture of a rich and shiny life that might be possible, putting aside all the major obstacles. Like any business proposal, it is meant to intrigue potential investors and get them dreaming big before getting bogged down by pesky facts on the ground.Sign up for the Quartz Obsession emailEnter your emailSign me upStay updated about Quartz products and events.",0.878

This is going to the Supreme Court where they will rule that the election is invalid due to fraud or mistakes on a Country wide scale. It will go one of two ways, either they will rule that all the Unconstitutional mail-in ballots will be removed and the States ordered to recount without them or they will simply rule the election is invalid due to mass voter fraud. At that point it will be sent to the House and Senate for a vote. The House will vote on who the President will be. It has nothing to do with what party that has power. Every State gets one vote and 30 States are held by Republicans.and 19 by Democrats. They have to vote down party lines, they have no choice due to the 12th Amendment of the Constitution and the Senate votes for the Vice President where a similar event will take place. This is The Law. This will all happen in January. President Trump will remain President.

Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), an outspoken critic of Israel’s occupation of Palestine, accused the influential lobby group American Israel Public Affairs Committee of being a hate group that weaponizes anti-Semitism to silence dissent. Last month, AIPAC started running paid Facebook advertisements with pictures of McCollum, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.). The ads warned that the “radicals in the Democratic Party are pushing their anti-Semitic and anti-Israel policies down the throats of the American people,” according to the Jewish Telegraph Agency. The ads included a link to a petition urging supporters to “protect our Israeli allies especially as they face threats from Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, ISIS and — maybe more sinister — right here in the U.S. Congress.”“AIPAC claims to be a bipartisan organization, but its use of hate speech actually makes it a hate group,” McCollum said in a statement on Tuesday. “By weaponizing anti-Semitism and hate to silence debate, AIPAC is taunting Democrats and mocking our core values.”The implication that McCollum and her colleagues represent a bigger threat to Israel than ISIS “is not a call to action, it is incitement,” McCollum said. Omar and Tlaib, who are the first Muslim women elected to Congress, have faced racist threats and attacks — including from the president. “Hate speech is intentionally destructive and dehumanizing, which is why it is used as a weapon by groups with a stake in profiting from oppression,” McCollum continued.AIPAC removed the most offensive ads and apologized on Saturday for “the inaccurate assertion that the poorly worded, inflammatory advertisement implied.” But the group reiterated its claim that a certain group of members in Congress are “deliberately working to erode the bipartisan consensus on this issue and undermine the U.S.-Israel relationship.”",-0.995

BAC price will be corrected after the investigation. The actual price should be at least over $50/shareOne hacker has been secretly manipulating Bank of America (BAC) stock price, controlling its price, dragging its price down for the past five years from approximately middle of 2013 till present 09/2019. After 12/12/2016, his manipulation activity became more frequent. He has been obsessed with one lady and hates her to own BAC stock price and several other stocks. He made her other stocks either bankruptcy or became penny stock or became a few dollars stock. He can’t make Bank Of America bankruptcy due to the bank is too large and billionaire Warren Buffet is the largest shareholder.This hacker has been sharing the lady’s computer IP and all browsers at his computer and monitoring all her online activities. If you watch carefully, you will discover when all bank stocks price went up a lot in the past several years, Bank of America stock price only went up a little or even dropped down mysteriously for many times in the past. BAC shows very weak to go up while other bank stocks went up a lot. On a good earning date with good news, BAC stock price dropped down mysteriously while other bank stocks’ price went up a lot. I noticed such suspicious activity twice on earning report date.This hacker/stalker made BAC lost many chance to go up in the past while other bank stocks’ price went up a lot. I think SEC should correct BAC stock price to $50We have filed report on FBI ic3.gov and SEC.gov, but this hacker hacked into those government sites to delete all our reports. She mailed letters to FBI, SEC, stock company Chairman and attorneys, but this stalker/hacker hacked into USPS post office computers and transferred away her mails. He knows all her writings through hacking and sharing her computer activities secretly. Trying to cover his BAC stock price manipulation crime, this hacker/stalker has been secretly manipulating several other bank stocks’ price as well. I hope someone will notice Bank of America all shareholders, investors including Warren Buffet and Bank of America headquarter CEO, JPM CEO, media , FBI and SEC for investigation this crime. Warren Buffet is the largest shareholder of Bank of America stock with 927,248,600 shares . It made him lose at least over $10B. But Mr. Buffet doesn’t know BAC stock price manipulation conspiracy.

Greatness is best passed on by example. When you become someone to learn from and look up to, you are also expanding your own influence.Related: Find a Mentor9. Kindness along the way. There are opportunities for kindness that appear to us throughout the day, and they are easy for us to perform. Examples include giving up your seat on the bus, letting someone ahead of you in line, giving a whole-hearted smile in greeting or thanks, helping a child cross the street, uttering a prayer for the patient as an ambulance goes by, carrying a package for someone or holding the door open for another. Your day has the potential to be a treasure hunt and treasure trove of chesed (lovingkindness) if you look for and take advantage of the myriad daily opportunities to perform it. Be attuned to the possibilities around you, and your day and life will become a spiritual smorgasbord of kindness.Related: Kindness MitzvotBy Rosally SaltsmanRosally Saltsman is a freelance writer originally from Montreal living in Israel.

2281,"dangerWhile security experts believe it’s likely that Iran will avoid direct retaliation against Israel in order not to provoke a counterattack, they still worry about Israel becoming embroiled in unintended escalation between the U.S. and Iran. Indeed, even before the strike against General Soleimani, Iran’s presence in Syria and its support for Hezbollah in Lebanon stoked considerable tension along Israel’s northern border. Now, Israel will have to factor in the flammable aftermath of that targeted killing when it decides whether to hit Iran or its allies, such as a deadly attack on an air base in the Syrian province of Homs Tuesday that Damascus accused Israel of carrying out.According to a report Wednesday in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Israel’s Military Intelligence branch sees the current U.S.-Iran clash as creating an opportunity for Israel to strike at Iranian and allied targets, even though it expects Iran or Hezbollah would respond to any fatalities.“We are closer to the threshold of escalation, and the probability or prospect of miscalculation is much higher than it was before the assassination,” says Kobi Michael, a fellow at INSS.“If Israel needs to operate, it will be a good reason for these militias to retaliate much more aggressively.

2290,"ISRAEL TO TURN AWAY CORRUPTION???????????JERUSALEM—An elated Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin “Bibi” Netanyahu roared “this is the biggest victory of my life!”—but that was Monday.By Thursday, his voice hoarse, a tired Netanyahu growled, “We won’t let them steal the election!” In the words of Netanyahu’s centrist rival and Israel’s probable next prime minister, Benny Gantz, “Someone here celebrated too early.”Even Netanyahu’s Dirty Tricks Couldn’t Quite Win Him a MajorityThen came a remarkable cascade of bad news for Netanyahu, Israel’s longest serving prime minister, and its first to be indicted while in office.Avigdor Lieberman, his onetime defense minister and now a fearsome nemesis, announced his support for a law proposed by Gantz, a former army chief of staff, which would bar an indicted legislator from being appointed to form the government.Such a law would eliminate any route to immediate political survival for Netanyahu, whose trial in three separate cases of bribery, fraud and breach of trust is scheduled to open in Jerusalem District Court on March 17.In an almost unseen instance of Israeli multi-partisanship that Israeli media call “the anti-Bibi coalition,” this law enjoys the support of 62 members of the 120-member Knesset, from the majority-Arab Joint List through the left-wing Labor Party, and now, unto Lieberman, a hardline secular right-winger.Further, Lieberman, who holds seven potentially king-making Knesset seats, announced that he would recommend Israel’s President Reuven Rivlin choose Gantz to form the next government.It is the third election in under a year in which Netanyahu—and Gantz—have failed to secure an operating majority of the Knesset, but for Netanyahu the stakes are higher.Alon Pinkas, Israel’s former consul general in New York and adviser to former prime minister Ehud Barak, noted in an interview with The Daily Beast, that, “For the third time in one year, Netanyahu pushed for an election with one goal in mind: getting a 61-seat majority to grant him an immunity from prosecution over three severe indictments he is facing. For the third time he failed.”Netanyahu “could not form a government in April 2019, September 2019 and he cannot and will not form a government following the March 2020 election,” said Pinkas. “Cut the electorate however you want, in all three instances a [slim] majority sent a resounding ‘no’ to his anti-democratic, anti-legal, it’s-all-about-me message.”And Netanyahu was about to receive another blow.Late Thursday, Moshe Yaalon, another former army chief of staff and the most hardline rightist in the Gantz centrist coalition, agreed to support a minority government led by Gantz, with the support of the Joint List, the Arab-majority party that leapt from 13 Knesset seats to 15 even as Netanyahu intensified his attack on Arab citizens, wh",0.9866

2301,"TRUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!A ‘peace plan’ in name onlyIt’s important to understand that the Trump administration’s so-called ‘Deal of the Century’ is not a ‘peace’ plan in any conventional sense. The administration has made no attempt to broker Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and or to reach any good-faith agreement. Instead, the plan is expected to be the culmination of a series of steps taken by Trump and his team to advance the annexationist agenda of Prime Minister Netanyahu and the far-right settlement movement in Israel. The known contours of the plan appear designed to formalize, entrench and legitimize permanent Israeli control of the occupied West Bank and to undercut any prospect of Palestinian statehood via a two-state solution.Palestinian representatives have not been consulted in the plan’s development.Key officials in charge of developing the plan — former envoy Jason Greenblatt, Ambassador David Friedman and Jared Kushner — have records of active personal support for the settlement movement prior to appointment.Kushner has urged observers to banish “two-state solution” from their vocabulary.A one-time aide to former Israeli Prime Minister Begin described the plan as a “document of surrender” for Palestinians.US Ambassador David Friedman has said the plan would grant Israel perpetual “overriding security control” of the West Bank, which he does not believe to be occupied.The plan is likely to attempt to ‘buy’ support from Palestinians through promises of investment from Gulf states. It’s important to know that previous Gulf investment pledges have failed to come through, and that West Bank business leaders have said without a political and diplomatic plan to end the occupation, a sustainable investment environment for Palestinians is not possible. Previous actions which have ignored Palestinian concerns and aspirations, discarded previous peace frameworks and promoted the Israeli far-right’s agenda include: Moving the US embassy to JerusalemSlashing all funding for humanitarian aid to Palestinians, including through UNRWAClosing the Palestinian mission to WashingtonRecognizing Israel’s unilateral annexation of the Golan Heights",0.9931

Israel’s systematic use of prisons is part of its brutal occupation of Palestine.Reposted from SamidounIsraeli occupation officials announced that child prisoners would be transferred away from the Ofer prison and separated into cells without the adult prisoner representatives who support them before the prison administration on Saturday, 11 January. In response, the Palestinian Prisoners’ Society noted that this is another attempt to confiscate one of the achievements of Palestinian prisoners that came through long periods of struggle, putting Palestinian children and youth at further risk.The Prisoners Society noted that, rather than being held in groups, child prisoners would be held two to a cell. It said that this tactic was designed to isolate imprisoned children further from one another and from protective oversight of Palestinian elder prisoners. It also noted that prisoners would launch a series of protests in response, noting that this comes as part of a series of efforts to roll back achievements defending Palestinian prisoners’ rights that has been taking place systematically since 2018.Specifically, the Israeli prison administration declared that around 60 child prisoners – out of a total of 200 children currently detained by the Israeli occupation. On Sunday evening, they announced that 34 Palestinian children would be transferred to Damon prison on Monday morning, 13 January, without the presence of their adult representatives.Removing Palestinian child prisoners from the Ofer prison is particularly worrisome because Ofer is the main Israeli prison within the occupied West Bank of Palestine. Despite the Fourth Geneva Convention’s prohibition of the transfer of people under occupation to detention centers and prisons in the occupying power’s territory, the vast majority of Palestinian prisoners are subjected to exactly this type of transfer.",-0.9951

Behold, I have rescued those who hated me without cause”(7:5).In addition, Jewish law forbids us to bear a grudge. Thus, the Talmud explains, you may not even say to the person who wronged you that you will act rightly, even though he or she did not.2Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi in his code of Jewish law concludes that, “one should erase any feelings of revenge from one’s heart and never remind oneself of it.”3The HeartNot taking revenge is not just about modifying one’s actual actions; it is also that the thought of revenge never even enter one’s heart.4The 13th-century Talmudist, Rabbi Aharon HaLevi of Barcelona, explains:One of the roots of this commandment is that a person should know in his heart that all that happens to him, whether good or bad, is because it is G‑d’s will that it happen to him... It was G‑d who wished this to happen, and one should not consider taking revenge from the other person, because the other person is not the reason for what happened.5(Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi explains in his Tanya that while the person wronged needs to forgive, the person who did the action is still held accountable, for “G‑d has many agents” through whom He can act.6)The verse prohibiting revenge ends with the famous maxim, “You should love your fellow as yourself.” Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman, “Nachmanides,” explains that erasing the event from your heart will guarantee that you will never come to transgress the commandment, allowing you to love your fellow, no matter what transpires between the two of you.7See Is Turning the Other Cheek a Jewish Value? from our Jewish Ethics & Morality section.FOOTNOTES1.

Anti-Zionist forms of anti-Semitism, he believed, were a growing problem on campus.But in Chicago, Rabbi Hara Person, the chief executive of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, saw the president’s action and worried. In a terse directive Wednesday, Trump said anti-Semitism would be covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which “prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin,” but does not mention religion.“Not to overdramatize, but it feels dangerous,” she said. “I’ve heard people say this feels like the first step toward us wearing yellow stars.”The politics of the executive order seemed clear when it was signed Wednesday. Attending the signing ceremony were prominent Jews and evangelical Christians, Democrats and Republicans, and some big-name donors. Trump, at a party after the ceremony, lavished praise on Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson: “He’s got no cash problem — that, I can tell you.”“My administration will never tolerate the suppression, persecution or silencing of the Jewish people,” Trump declared at the ceremony, which doubled as a Hanukkah party.In rattling off all he had done for Israel’s government — moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal — the president appeared intent on expanding his support among Jewish voters, or at least peeling off portions of a small and largely Democratic voting bloc, as well as pleasing evangelical supporters and major donors like Adelson.The executive order “will g",0.9908

To date, Gaza’s Ministry of Health reports that 50 protesters have been shot in the eye since the demonstrations began March 30, 2018—leaving them permanently blind.“Some of these protesters and journalists were hit in the eye with teargas canisters, but most were targeted directly with what is commonly called a ‘rubber bullet,’ giving the impression they are somehow benign,” says Ashraf Alqedra, MD, a treating physician at Gaza City’s al-Shifa Hospital and spokesperson for the Ministry of Health. “But there is still steel at the core, and although these bullets don’t usually kill, they do grave damage. It is impossible to save an eye hit directly by a rubber-coated steel bullet.”However, he adds, due to the Israeli blockade, there are no artificial, glass eyes in Gaza—only a cosmetic improvement, but one that can be a significant psychological aid. These are available only by traveling out of Gaza for treatment and permits for such journeys are often not granted.According to data released by the World Health Organization, Gaza residents submitted 25,897 applications to travel via Erez Crossing to receive medical treatment in the West Bank or Israel; an average of 2,158 were submitted each month.

Let it sink in deep.What people say and do to you is much more about them, than you. People’s reactions to you are about their perspectives, wounds and experiences. Whether people think you’re amazing, or believe you’re the worst, again, is more about them and how they view the world. The key is in not allowing anyone's crude commentary to control you in any way. They don’t deserve to control you. In fact, the real test always comes when you don't get what you expect from people. Will you react in uncontrollable emotion? Or will calmness be your superpower?Now, I’m not suggesting we should be self-indulged narcissists and ignore all the opinions and commentary we receive from others. I’m simply saying that incredible amounts of hurt, disappointment and sadness in our lives come directly from our tendency to take things personally. In most cases it’s far more productive and healthy to let go of other people’s good or bad opinions of you, and to operate with your own intuition and wisdom as your guide.The truth is, almost nothing in life is personal—things happen, or they don’t, and it’s rarely all about anyone specifically. People have emotional issues they’re dealing with, and it makes them defiant, rude, and thoughtless sometimes. They are doing the best they can, or they’re not even aware of their issues. In any case, you can learn not to interpret their behaviors as personal attacks, and instead see them as non-personal encounters (like a dog barking in the distance, or a bumblebee buzzing by) that you can either respond to with a peaceful mindset, or not respond to at all.The underlying key is to watch your response.Here’s what you need to remember and repeat to yourself…You may not be able control all the things people say and do to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.Yes, there is an incredible amount of inner freedom that comes to you when you detach from other people’s behaviors.

When his student R. Eliezer ben Horkenus returned from his travels, he reported: “I have searched, and I have found that the best advice is to develop an ayin tov, a good eye.”1When your eye, your lens on life, is good, what you see will be good, no matter what.Of course, the opposite is also true. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to work on developing the capacity to see G‑d and the good in all. This is the essence of a good eye.When you view the world in such a way, you will tend to find positive interpretations of events and experiences, as well as judge others in the most favorable light. Every human being possesses this capacity for redemptive vision, but achieving and maintaining it requires effort.Between You and EyeOne area in particular that benefits from an ayin tov is personal relationships, whether at work or within the family or community. Interpersonal relationships are complicated and messy, as we each have very different views, definitions, associations, narratives, word choices, insecurities, and projections, creating near-constant opportunities for misunderstanding and judgment.When we speak with others, we are often unconsciously importing the energy of our previous encounters, and we sometimes carry over the residue of angst and resentments from the past. In any conversation or encounter there is the possibility for misappropriation of meaning and intent, giving rise to unnecessary skepticism, and ultimately suspicion of others.

Perhaps, the likes of $MS and $GS who appear to particularly detest exel, have been cut off from deal making, were not invited for secondary offers in the past, and or had bought stock thinking they could benefit from sale of the company. Since quick sale did not happen, they are bitter and they are trying everything in their power including their bots, to keep the lid on pps appreciation. There are a number of companies pre-clinical or even commercial, who are losing a lot of money per share every Q, and yet they command much higher PPS and no negative coverage. Even negative news is spun as positive and future potential, and the pps keeps going up. EXEL on the other hand has beaten all odds, no tjust one or 2 Qs by accident or by Chance, but repeatedly since launch and especially for the last 5 Qs, and yet there is always this boogeyman- that's going to destroy exlixis' prospects or drive them out of the market etc etc. Not to mention the recent failure of Ketruda in 2nd line + HCC indication where again Cabo will be king.

2514,"WILL ISRAEL MOVE CAPITAL TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE USA MIJERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's foreign minister denounced Democratic front-runner Bernie Sanders on Wednesday for what he called his “horrifying comment"" about Jerusalem, saying that those who support Israel would not back Sanders' presidential candidacy after such remarks.At a contentious Democratic debate on Tuesday night in South Carolina, Sanders labeled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a ""reactionary racist"" and said he'd consider reversing President Donald Trump's move of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The move, following Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, outraged the Palestinians and led to a dramatic fallout with the U.S. administration.In a daring foray into American domestic politics, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said there was a not a Jew in the world who “hasn't dreamed of Jerusalem” and Sanders words were so severe that he had no choice but to retort.“We don't intervene in the internal American electoral process, which is splendid,” Katz told Israel's Army Radio, before noting that Sanders had a long history of attacking Israel and the things most sacred to its identity and national security.“Naturally, people who support Israel will not support someone who goes against these things,” he added.Sanders' comments at the debate came after he recently announced he would skip an appearance before the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC, which he called a “platform for bigotry.”He's also called for cutting back American foreign aid to Israel and redirecting it to the Palestinians instead. Sanders, who if elected would become America's first Jewish president, doubled down Tuesday saying: “What you cannot ignore is the suffering of the Palestinian people.”Sanders prefaced his remarks by saying he was “very proud of being Jewish,” and noted how he had volunteered in the 1960s on a socialist Israeli kibbutz, where he honed his leftist leanings. But his harsh criticism of modern-day Israeli policies, and embrace of supporters who have called for a boycott Israel, has raised great concerns in the Jewish state about his surging candidacy. Pro-Israel advocates have accused some of Sanders' prominent supporters of anti-Semitism.Sanders has firmly established himself in the lead after scoring primary and caucus victories in the first three nominating states: Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.Yair Lapid, a leading opposition figure who aims to replace Katz as foreign minister after next week's Israeli election, said in a recent TV interview that he was “very worried” about Sanders' rise because of his “lack of understanding of our unique situation in the Middle East.""The majority of American Jews vote Democrat and have been very critical of the Trump presidency.But in Israel, Trump has been warmly embraced by Netanyahu and his allies, which has contributed to undermining the decades-long traditional bi-partisan support Israel has enjoyed in the United States.Even so, Trump has remained very popular in Israel for backing it in a hostile region and delivering it a string of diplomatic achievements. Last month, Trump unveiled his much-anticipated Mideast plan to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It sided with Israel on most of its core demands and granted it sovereignty over large parts of the West Bank that the Palestinians seek for a future state.",0.9939

2521,"WHAT IS TO BE DONE???Halfway through a 10-day tour in Israel, Risa Nagel had a decision to make.The 25-year-old grant writer from Seattle had hiked the hills of Galilee and wandered the ancient market in Jerusalem. But then some of the friends she had just met told her they were planning to walk off the tour to visit a Palestinian family, an act of protest that was bound to cause pain and controversy.“We will be able to see for ourselves what’s going on,” one of them told her. “Do you want to come?”Ms. Nagel agonized. The next day, after the group held a moment of silence at the Western Wall, her friends announced that they were walking off. She followed them.Over nearly two decades, a nonprofit organization called Birthright Israel has given nearly 700,000 young Jews an all-expense-paid trip to Israel, an effort to bolster a distinct Jewish identity and forge an emotional connection to Israel. The trips, which are partly funded by the Israeli government, have become a rite of passage for American Jews. Nearly 33,000 are set to travel this summer.ADVERTISEMENTBut over the past year, some Jewish activists have protested Birthright, saying the trips erase the experiences of Israeli Arabs and Palestinians living under occupation in the West Bank. Activists have circulated petitions, staged sit-ins at Hillels on college campuses and blocked Birthright’s headquarters in New York. But no protests have generated more publicity and outrage than the walk-offs from a handful of Birthright trips.Supporters of Birthright dismiss the protesters, calling them professional activists and publicity seekers whose views are out of step with the majority of American Jews. Others say that the function of the trip is not to educate participants about Palestinians. In a statement, Birthright said that demand for its trips was higher than ever, and that the trips grappled with Israel’s complex history in an apolitical manner.You have 2 free articles remaining.Subscribe to The Times“We do not shy away from open discussion of the geopolitical realities in Israel, including the conflict,” the statement said.But the protests highlight growing unease among many young American Jews over Israel’s policies. They see Israeli leaders who have been drifting rightward and openly embracing the annexation of the West Bank, land on which Palestinians have long hoped to build their own state.The Birthright protests also highlight a generational divide between Jews who grew up with the constant fear of Israel’s destruction, and younger people today who may be more likely to take Israel’s existence for granted, and who focus instead on the millions of Palestinians left stateless by the conflict.ADVERTISEMENTJust 6 percent of American Jews over the age of 50 believe that the United States gives Israel too much support, according to research by Dov Waxman, a professor of political science, international affairs and Israel studies at Northeastern University. But that view is held by 25 percent of Jews aged 18 to 29, the cohort that goes on Birthright trips.Many older Jewish Americans have long expressed unease about Israel’s settlements in the West Bank, but consider it anathema to openly protest the Jewish state.Ms. Nagel, who grew up in Glen Cove, Long Island, had organized against climate change in college and for racial equity as an adult. But she had never been involved in any Israel-related protest before her Birthright trip.Her Jewish upbringing included Hebrew school, a bat mitzvah, and a desire to go on Birthright.“I was told, ‘This is your homeland. You have to go there,’” she said. She knew little about the conflict, she said, when she signed up for a “free 10-day vacation.”Several of those who walked off the Birthright trip last year visited Umm al Khair, a Bedouin community in the West Bank.CreditElias NewmanImageSeveral of those who walked off the Birthright trip last year visited Umm al Khair, a Bedouin community in the West Bank.CreditElias NewmanOn the group’s first night in Israel, one of the attendees, a law student named Rebecca Wasserman, asked if she could facilitate a discussion about Israel’s military control over the West Bank. The group’s Israeli guide agreed, and even shared some of his own deeply personal experiences as a former Israeli soldier.Many welcomed the talk that first night, said Ben Fields, 26, a college counselor from Denver.“It felt at first like it was a good-natured attempt to have these conversations,” Mr. Fields said. “Absolutely, these were things we should talk about.”ADVERTISEMENTBut as the trip wore on, Ms. Wasserman and three others kept bringing up the same points.“They kept saying, ‘When are we going to hear from Palestinians?’” Mr. Fields recalled.Mr. Fields did not know it at the time, but Ms. Wasserman and the other three had all been in contact with IfNotNow, a network of Jewish activists who want to end Jewish American support for the occup",0.9983

To choose to give into your temper or to keep doing things the way you’ve always done them. Beautiful choices—like physical fitness or perfect skin—are rarely as effortless as they seem.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested Thursday if President Donald Trump wants to belittle her Baltimore hometown as rat-infested, then he should consult with his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, whom she calls a ""slumlord.""Pelosi's remarks upon returning to the Capitol were her first public comments over the days-long attacks Trump has been waging on the black-majority city and one of its congressional representatives, Elijah Cummings, who is investigating the administration as chairman of the powerful House Oversight committee.The speaker, who grew up in Baltimore— and whose father and brother both served as mayor decades ago — said the city is a great source of pride, as is Cummings, whose district includes parts of the city.""The president, this comes as no surprise, really doesn't know what he's talking about,"" she told reporters as she and Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, brushed past crowds of tourists on their way to a bill ceremony. ""But he maybe could ask his son in law, who's a slumlord there, if he wants to talk about rodents.""Kushner's family real estate firm owns thousands of apartments and townhomes in the Baltimore area. Some have been criticized for the kind of disrepair and neglect that Trump has accused local leaders of failing to address.Asked Thursday if his son-in-law, who is a senior adviser at the White House, bears any responsibility for the city's problems, Trump revived his attack on the congressman.

It is easy to fall into a mindset that the ends justify the means, or to listen to only one opinion about matters of importance. But the Talmud’s expansiveness reminds us over and over again that the thinking process matters. Indeed, the sages don’t recite dogmas.

These actions would destroy Israeli democracy and constitute a flagrant violation of international law.The Prime Minister also made clear his intention to secure President Trump’s full approval for these steps. Given that the administration’s clear embrace of settlement expansion, opposition to the two-state solution and contempt for Palestinian aspirations has helped to bring us to this point, there’s every reason to believe that the White House could soon give Netanyahu the green light. An official presidential endorsement of annexation could come at any minute in the next few days or weeks.To respond to this unprecedented threat, House leadership must immediately bring to the floor a vote on House Resolution 326, which clearly opposes annexation and affirms US support for the two-state solution — and already has the support of over 180 Members of Congress. Responsible lawmakers and presidential candidates must also make clear that they will not give the Israeli government a blank check to violate US interests and democratic values.

Security Council on Tuesday and then appear at a news conference with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, an opponent of the U.S. plan who was forced to resign a decade ago ahead of a corruption indictment that later sent him to prison for 16 months.Kushner called Olmert’s appearance “almost pathetic.”Leaders who had their c",-0.1019

The present article aims at exploring personality characteristics associated with individual differences in feeling sorry for oneself. Two studies with N = 141 and N = 161 university students were conducted, employing multidimensional measures of personality, control beliefs, anger, loneliness, and adult attachment. With respect to personality, results showed strong associations of self-pity with neuroticism, particularly with the depression facet. With respect to control beliefs, individuals high in self-pity showed generalized externality beliefs, seeing themselves as controlled by both chance and powerful others. With respect to anger expression, self-pity was primarily related to anger-in. Strong connections with anger rumination were also found. Furthermore, individuals high in self-pity reported emotional loneliness and ambivalent-worrisome attachments. Finally, in both studies, a strong correlation with gender was found, with women reporting more self-pity reactions to stress than men. Findings are discussed with respect to how they support, extend, and qualify the previous literature on self-pity, and directions for future empirical research are pointed out",0.9649

In one case, a woman’s ceiling collapsed directly over her bed, leaving brick and cement debris.

Kushner Companies did not even own her property in 2010, but sued her for breaking her lease when it bought the property three years later. Unable to find the document proving she had permission to leave, Kushner Companies got legal permission to clear out her bank account and garnish her wages.Kushner Companies did not have Certificates of Occupancy for many of its New York City rental buildings, and the government looked the other way.A Certificate of Occupancy, or CO, must be obtained by the New York City Health Department proving that a building is safe to live in.

The screen on the phone is already cracked. My dog-eared copy of Meditations just fell apart. Ownership—much like existence—is transitory. So while I prize these possessions, they are also a great reminder of how ephemeral all of this is. The Stoics talk a lot about detachment, loosening the hold that possessions have on us, embracing the truth of uncertainty, having the ability to enjoy whatever is in front of you, whether that’s a brand new Tesla or a beat-up Taurus. “He is a great man who uses earthenware dishes as if they were silver,” Seneca wrote, “but he is equally great who uses silver as if it were earthenware.” That’s the idea. You don’t have to abstain from having nice things. If you can afford it, or if it was given to you, what’s the point? What you do have to reject is the idea that they say anything about you as a person. You have to reject the idea that these things are somehow special because they are valuable or because other people desire them. The Stoics would urge us to remember that things don’t make the man.",0.9925

2801,"ISRAELI LEFTClear-eyed and unsparing, Ben-Ami traces the twists and turns of the Middle East conflict and gives us behind-the-scenes accounts of the meetings in Oslo, Madrid, and Camp David. The author paints particularly trenchant portraits of key figures from Ben-Gurion to Bill Clinton. He is highly critical of both Ariel Sharon and the late Yasser Arafat, seeing Arafat's rejection of Clinton's peace plan as a crime against the Palestinian people. The author is also critical of President Bush's Middle East policy, which he calls ""a presumptuous grand strategy."" Along the way, Ben-Ami highlights the many blunders on both sides, describing for instance how the great victory of the Six Day War launched many Israelis on a misbegotten ""messianic"" dream of controlling all the Biblical Jewish lands, which only served to make the Palestinian problem much worse. In contrast, it has only been when Israel has suffered setbacks that it has made moves towards peace. The best hope for the region, he concludes, is to create an international mandate in the Palestinian territories that would lead to the implementation of Clinton's two-state peace parameters.Scars of War, Wounds of Peace is a major work of history--with by far the most fair and balanced critique of Israel ever to come from one of its key officials. This paperback edition features a new Epilogue by the author featuring an analysis of the most recent events in the Israeli-Arab situation, from the disappearance of Ariel Sharon from public life to the emergence of Hamas and Israel's recent war against Hizballah.

We plan to skip all the legal stuff like visas, passports, immigration quotas and laws. I'm sure they handle those things the same way you do here. So, would you mind telling your buddy, the President of Mexico , that I'm on my way over? Please let him know that I will be expecting the following: 1. Free medical care for my entire family. 2. English-speaking Government bureaucrats for all services I might need, whether I use them or not. 3. Please print all Mexican Government forms in English. 4. I want my grandkids to be taught Spanish by English-speaking (bi-lingual) teachers. 5. Tell their schools they need to include classes on American culture and history. 6. I want my grandkids to see the American flag on one of the flag poles at their school. 7. Please plan to feed my grandkids at school for both breakfast and lunch. 8. I will need a local Mexican driver's license so I can get easy access to government services. 9. I do plan to get a car and drive in Mexico, but I don't plan to purchase car insurance, and I probably won't make any special effort to learn local traffic laws. 10. In case one of the Mexican police officers does not get the memo from their president to leave me alone, please be sure that every patrol car has at least one English-speaking officer. 11. I plan to fly the U.S. flag from my housetop, put U.S. flag decals on my car, and have a gigantic celebration on July 4th. I do not want any complaints or negative comments from the locals. 12. I would also like to have a nice job without paying any taxes, or have any labor or tax laws enforced on any business I may start. 13. Please have the president tell all the Mexican people to be extremely nice and never say critical things about me or my family, or about the strain we might place on their economy. 14. I want to receive free food stamps. 15. Naturally, I'll expect free rent subsidies. I'll need income tax credits so that although I don't pay Mexican taxes, I'll receive money from the government. 17. Please arrange it so that the Mexican Government pays $4,500.00 to help me buy a new car. 18. Oh yes, I almost forgot, please enroll me free into the Mexican Social Security program so that I'll get a monthly income in retirement. I know this is an easy request because you already do all these things for all of his people who walk over to the U.S. from Mexico.

When someone is willing to disturb the status quo and stand for the dream of a free and secure world, who will stand with them? DISTURBING THE PEACE is a story of the human potential unleashed when we stop participating in a story that no longer serves us and, with the power of our convictions, take action to create new possibilities. DISTURBING THE PEACE follows former enemy combatants - Israeli soldiers from elite units and Palestinian fighters, many of whom served years in prison - who have joined together to challenge the status quo and say “enough.""

Over the past two years, he has:Said that Israel has the right to annex parts of the West BankPressured the State Department to stop using the word “occupation”Participated as a guest of honor in events led by the settlement movementTold press to “keep your mouths shut” about Israel’s use of force against protesters in GazaTold a journalist “there’s no question Republicans support Israel more than Democrats”Again and again, Friedman has used his post to promote creeping annexation, excuse the occupation and launch partisan attacks.It’s time for Congress to say that enough is enough.Urge your members of Congress to support measures that hold Friedman to account for his outrageous conduct.Thank you,Kyle Fradkin,Assistant Director of Government AffairsP.S.

There is a new outbreak of violence which has garnered a lot of media attention. So I guess our responsibility here first of all is to explain what is going on. I don’t think there is much disagreement about the broad context of the current Palestinian resistance. It is an occupation that has now lasted nearly a half century; it began in 1967. So next year or the year after it is going to be 50 years – an occupation in which people effectively have no future – it is a futureless future. There’s no hope, no prospects for living a decent life. For young people who are at the forefront of the current resistance, the unemployment in the West Bank is estimated about 30 percent for the age 20s cohort. But it is probably around 50 per cent; 30 per cent is considered a low estimate. Even the jobs that people do have those who are employed – these are jobs that don’t require any great skills, even though the Palestinian population is very educated – these are not skilled jobs.",0.9302

On the other hand, the tax rate is not gonna matter if you don't get further immense fiscal stimulus, without which the economy will not rebound, and which only a DEM sweep will provide (think at least $3.5 trillion of added stimulus), the tariffs will be mostly rolled back or even eliminated, and TINA will still be in place for another 3-5 years as the FED stays on hold.

The image, aptly titled “Whack Job,” is the work of artist Barry Blitt, and was inspired by the whistleblower complaint that has helped to trigger an impeachment inquiry against Trump.The report, which was publicly released Thursday, accuses Trump of working with Giuliani to “to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 election,” citing a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.A summary of the discussion has revealed that Trump urged Zelensky to aid Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr in a probe of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, basing the investigation on unfounded corruption allegations against the Democratic presidential candidate.Trump has since disparaged the whistleblower, attempting to upend his reputation and challenge his credibility as a majority of House lawmakers have now come out in support of an impeachment inquiry.According to The New York Times, the whistleblower is a CIA officer who was detailed to the White House for a time and has deep knowledge of Ukrainian politics and foreign policy. He has expressed a willingness to meet with the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said Tuesday, though no timeline has been set.Love HuffPost?

When the Torah states numerous times that terrible suffering comes about because of one’s spiritual deficiencies, it does not mean that these are unrelated punishments. Rather, they are signposts to facilitate our personal growth. In fact the word for suffering in Hebrew, “yissurim,” shares the same root as the word for self-improvement or chastisement, “mussar” which in turn shares the same root as the word to change directions “sur.” The Talmud therefore adjures us that “If a person sees that suffering has befallen him, he should examine his deeds” (Talmud, Brachot 5a).",-0.5191

I'm willing to guess that both Lt and ALBERT don't even sense the connection. Vincent Van Gogh painted roughly 800 paintings during his lifetime, but during his entire life he was only able to sell a grand total of just 3 of these paintings. In order to support himself throughout his life he was constantly borrowing money, much of which came from a close family member who was financially ruined when it became apparent that Vincent could not pay back any of this borrowed money as Vincent was totally penniless when he died. Vincent died an agonizing and slow death from a gunshot wound to his stomach, which was at first speculatively attributed to a botched street robbery, but some experts still maintain that as unlikely as it seems, the wound was self-inflicted. Now my question to Lt and ALBERT is does any of this make Vincent Can Gogh less of an Artist????? Does any of President Trump's tax minimizing and accounting strategies make him less of a Popular President to his base?????

LEDERER,Associated Press 15 hours ago Reactions Reblog on Tumblr Share Tweet EmailUNITED NATIONS (AP) �#$%$? The U.N. independent expert on human rights in the Palestinian territories called Wednesday for an international ban on all products made in Israeli settlements as a step to potentially end Israel's 52-year ""illegal occupation.""Michael Lynk told the General Assembly's human rights committee that the international community should also issue ""a clarion call to the United Nations"" to complete and release a database ""on businesses engaged in activities related to the illegal settlements.""Israel is deeply opposed to the Palestinian-led international boycott movement, which it views as an attack on its very existence. Supporters of the boycott say it is a non-violent way of protesting Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.Israel's Foreign Ministry declined to comment on Lynk's statement.Lynk said the international community has a responsibility and a legal obligation to compel Israel to completely end its occupation and remove barriers to self-determination for the Palestinians.He pointed to the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which he called ""a human-made catastrophe"" and ""an injustice that should be near the top of the world's agenda to end."" He said the economic situation there ""continues to move from dire to acute to unimaginable,"" with over half of Gaza's population ""food insecure,"" the unemployment rate over 50%, and 70% of Gazans younger than 30 without work.Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on Gaza after the Islamic militant group Hamas seized power in 2007, and the border closures coupled with mismanagement by Hamas authorities have devastated the territory's economy.Lynk noted more than 200 Palestinians have been killed and over 33,000 wounded by Israeli fire at the Gaza-Israeli border since March 2018, when Hamas began organizing protests against the blockade.",-0.9845

As a coping mechanism, they learn to delude themselves that what is real is actually not real, and however they see the situation is real, even though it isn’t.Sometimes they truly see it that way. Other times it’s just a story they tell themselves and others. And often the longer you tell a story, the more you believe it, even if initially you know it’s not true. And so eventually they may start truly believing it.Either way, the first step is to create a version of events that is an alternative to what actually happened or what’s going on.LyingWhile delusion is more of an internal process, lying and denial is often in the context of other people.Regular people deal with their problems by themselves, internally. Or they discuss it in a very private setting: in therapy or among very close, healthy people. Narcissists don’t have people like that in their life and are not really interested in actually resolving anything or being introspective.Narcissists simply want to know that they are in the right. For that, they need other people’s false validation to regulate their shaky self-esteem. They need to find people who would agree with them. And in order for others to agree with them, these other people either need to be terribly unhealthy and unable to recognize their toxic tendencies, or the narcissist needs to lie and present a different story than what is actually true.",0.9826

3066,"USA TAX DOLLARS Israel’s Parliament has struck back at the international boycott movement against the country and its settlements in the West Bank by passing a law barring entry to foreigners who have publicly supported the movement.The measure, passed on Monday night, received little notice in Israel, but by Tuesday it set off alarms in the United States, where Israel’s critics and some of its most loyal Jewish supporters alike warned that it would further isolate the country.Rabbi Rick Jacobs, the president of the Union for Reform Judaism, the largest Jewish movement in North America, said in a telephone interview from Jerusalem: “It’s going to be a giant sign up by the door of the Jewish state: ‘Don’t come unless you agree with everything we’re doing here.’ I don’t know what kind of democracy makes that statement.”The vote came as the Israeli government’s right flank has been emboldened by the election of President Trump and his warm welcome in Washington last month of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The bill passed the Parliament, or Knesset, 46 to 28, with proponents calling it a common-sense measure to exclude “haters,” and opponents warning that it would backfire and encourage further boycotts.Sign up for The InterpreterSubscribe for original insights, commentary and discussions on the major news stories of the week, from columnists Max Fisher and Amanda Taub.SIGN UPADVERTISEMENTContinue reading the main storyWith hopes for a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians vastly diminished, Palestinians and their supporters have been advocating a strategy called B.D.S.: boycott, divestment and sanctions. The movement has been most active in Europe and the United States, and supporters have compared it to the campaign against apartheid in South Africa — an analogy fiercely disputed by defenders of Israel.Academic groups, artists, churches and companies from many countries are boycotting or divesting from Israel, or from the occupied territories in the West Bank. The Israeli government and other critics say the boycott movement is anti-Semitic and aims to undermine Israel’s right to exist.Bezalel Smotrich, a member of the Knesset who is a co-sponsor of the bill to bar entry to boycott supporters, said: “We will now stop turning the other cheek. Preventing B.D.S. supporters who come here to hurt us from the inside is the very least we should be doing against haters of Israel.”Dov Hanin, who voted against the legislation, said that at a time when boycotts against settlements are being promoted around the world, the law “is really a law to boycott the world.”“A country that boycotts the world is basically isolating and boycotting itself,” he continued.Israel has already turned away some travelers for political reasons. Last December, Isabel Phiri, a theologian and an assistant general secretary of the World Council of Churches in Geneva, was refused entry after landing in Tel Aviv with a tourist visa. Last July, five Americans on a fact-finding trip were detained, questioned and deported, with Israeli officials citing security reasons.ADVERTISEMENTContinue reading the main storyAnd in February, an American executive with the New Israel Fund, a liberal group, was detained and interrogated at the Tel Aviv airport by an interviewer holding a document that said “BDS.” The fund does not support the movement.The new law says it applies to any foreigner “who knowingly issues a public call for boycotting Israel” and is aware that this “has a reasonable possibility of leading to the imposition of a boycott.”Eytan Fuld, a spokesman for Mr. Smotrich, said there was no “blacklist” of individuals. He said the law would apply to “known organizations” and their “main activists.”Some American Jewish leaders were alarmed that the new law makes no distinction between groups that support boycotts of Israel proper and those that support boycotting products made in the settlements in the occupied West Bank.“It’s redefining as an enemy of Israel anyone who does not agree that the settlements are now and forever will be part of Israel,” said Lara Friedman, the director of policy and government relations for Americans for Peace Now. “That’s going to be problematic for a lot of American Jews who care about Israel. It’s just heartbreaking.”Rabbi Jacobs said the law would deter the kinds of people he often brings to Israel, those who have questions about its policies and should see the country for themselves.The Reform Jewish movement opposes the expansion of settlements, but is strongly opposed to the B.D.S. movement, and has tried to dissuade several American church groups from passing divestment resolutions.ADVERTISEMENTContinue reading the main story“If it’s perceived that Israel doesn’t want to engage in serious debates with diaspora Jews,” he said, “I think that really is a weakening of our relationship.”But Naftali Bennett, the leader of the right-wing Jewish Home",0.9835

But most of the questions from the audience of about 130 people centered on whether the Orthodox community is paying its fair share of property taxes.One of the fastest-growing municipalities in New Jersey, Lakewood is in the midst of a breathtaking building boom. Much of the new construction consists of multi-family duplexes, synagogues and private religious schools, or yeshivas, built to accommodate a steady influx of Orthodox families.

3144,"NO TO MID EAST WARAs Trump spent the day tweeting about his approval ratings Saturday, Americans in dozens of cities marched in the street to protest his latest foreign policy escalation.The protests followed the White House-ordered killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, which many saw as a provocation of war with Iran. In response, the anti-war coalition Act Now to Stop War and End Racism, or ANSWER, scheduled protests in 70 different locations around the U.S., including outside the White House and Trump Tower. In a statement on their website, ANSWER said they planned to “protest against a new war in the Middle East and [call] for the withdrawal of all U.S. troops and bases in the region.”“For all who believe in peace, for all who are opposed to yet another catastrophic war, now is the time to take action,” they wrote.While Trump has said the airstrike was intended to “stop a war” and not start one, the move has already inflamed tensions. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani vowed to take “revenge” on the U.S. for the killing of Soleimani, who led the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, while Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said the country would bear “responsibility for all the consequences”of the strike. The U.S. sent about 3,000 additional troops to the region on Friday, but said the deployment was in response not to the strike but to the storming of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. On Saturday, protesters marched through the streets of major U.S. cities, carrying signs reading “No More War,” and “Hands Off Iran.” Protesters in New York’s Times Square sang chants and clanged cowbells, while more than 100 people lined the snow-lined streets of Minneapolis with signs and banners. Outside of the White House, protesters chanted “U.S. out of the Middle East; No justice, no peace.”It’s unclear how many people participated in the protests, but hundreds were listed on Facebook as having attended in cities like Boston and Detroit. More than 500 people were marked as “interested” in a protest in Berlin, Germany.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

3150,"smartCognitive dominance is a way of tuning out the noise of the world so you can just focus on the signal, the fascinating but challenging problem at hand. For sports, the signal is clear, the problem is acting in such a way as to increase the probability of winning the game—allowing the muscle memory from practice to take over to make the shot, catch the pass, score the goal, beat the clock. That’s just the most obvious application of the discipline.For real life, cognitive dominance is a way of thinking, a methodology to quickly make difficult decisions while remaining clearly in sync with your overall worldview—what you value and perceive to be your most important life principle. I define life value as simply how you would describe winning the game of life. If asked on your deathbed if you had a meaningful life, you’d without hesitation say, “Yes.” That’s winning the game of life. And yes, I think you need to have a single easily accessible life goal in your mind. If you have that goal readily accessible in times of stress, you’ll abide by the principles you’ve embraced in times of leisure.The reason I fell so deeply into depression after Anthony was that in all of the drama of my everyday life over all of the years it took me to reach my professional life goals, I hadn’t clearly defined what my single life goal was. I didn’t know what “winning the game of life” would look like or feel like. So it was only reasonable that I succumbed to the disorientation of happenstance, the unexpected. Fear can easily freak you out when you don’t have a grip on what winning the game of life means to you. Stephen Covey described this funk in his landmark book The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, calling it “getting caught up in the thick of thin things.”Just after Anthony, I had no idea what my real problem was, which was my lack of defining and committing to a fundamental life value. In fact, how I reacted to the unexpected—making a herculean effort to run away from its meaning—was to thrash about with substances that would distract me (alcohol, tobacco and escapism) from negative emotions. I was in an ever-present state of fear.",0.9968

Would you like a new Cartier?Sara: No, not really.Jacob: Let's take a trip to Paris!""Sara: No, thanks.Jacob: How about we finally get that yacht…Sara: No, no!Jacob: Sara, tell me what would make you happy?Sara: A divorce.Jacob: Well, I wasn't thinking of spending that much.If we were meant to be biological partners, shouldn't it be easy to work as a team?Today's divorce rate is high. But while the divorce rate has been gradually increasing with each passing decade, making marriage work has never been easy. Somewhere in the beginning of my marriage, my mentor told me unequivocally: ""Marriage is not for the feeble and weak-kneed."" It takes a lot of focus and resolution to get along.But why should it be so hard? If G‑d created men and women as a match then shouldn't marriage be a smooth and natural transition? If we were meant to be biological partners, shouldn't it be easy to work as a team?Five hundred years ago, a Talmudic scholar and Jewish mystic addressed this very question. His name was Judah Lowe, better known simply as the Maharal. Born in 1520, he served as the rabbi of Prague for most of his life.What would a 16th century rabbi understand about a modern marriage, one based upon equality and individualism? More than we'd think. In his fascinating commentary to the Torah, the Maharal picks up and examines an unusual phrase in the beginning of Genesis (2:18): ""It is not good that man is alone; I shall make him a helpmate opposite him.""After creating man, G‑d decides that it's time to create a woman, and before doing so He expresses the dynamic of their relationship: ""a helpmate opposite him."" This description is a classic oxymoron; a ""helpmate"" implies assistance, while ""opposite him"" implies resistance.The Maharal sees in these words a very telling instruction about the intent of marriage. A person, he writes, can be a helpmate to his parents, for example, but shouldn't ever stand to oppose them. ""But a woman,"" he continues, ""who is of equal value and importance to a man, will help him and oppose him.""Perhaps she can help him by opposing and challenging his viewpoint at times. Disagreements in marriage can be a real exercise in humility and maturity and force us to transcend our subjectivity. If we embrace the discomfort of the dispute we can come out with a lot more than a wounded ego.We grow when our opinions are challengedThe Talmud tells us about two great sages, Rabbi Yochanan and Reish Lakish. They were close friends and study partners (brothers-in-law, too). When Reish Lakish died, Rabbi Yochanan mourned him so deeply that he was unable to be consoled. Without his study partner he could not go on with life. Rabbi Yochanan's students begged him to return to the study hall and study with them. Rabbi Yochanan agreed and his students were relieved. But Rabbi Yochanan was not consoled; he cried out loud saying, ""Alas! When I laid out my initial proposition you showed me numerous supporting proofs for my argument—but when I learned with Reish Lakish he would bring the same amount of arguments to disprove the validity of my argument.""We grow when our opinions are challenged.And then the Maharal brings a second understanding of the words:",0.9965

If an elderly person stinks, it's probably due to one of the other contributing factors. Increased attention to personal hygiene and upping water intake should be enough to address unpleasant odor in a healthy individual. However, if a person's smell is truly rank, there's probably an underlying medical cause. A trip to the doctor and dentist may be in order, along with a review of medications that may affect body odor. There are actually products marketed specifically to address ""old people smell."" In Japan, the odor even has its own name: Kareishu. The cosmetic firm Shiseido Group has a perfume line intended to neutralize nonenal.

Ran HaCohen, an Israeli academic, sums up the situation as of June 2002:Step by step, Palestinians have been dispossessed and surrounded bysettlements, military camps, by-pass roads and checkpoints, squeezed intosealed-off enclaves. Palestinian towns are besieged by tanks and armed vehiclesblocking all access roads. West Bank villages too are surrounded by road blocks,preventing the movement of vehicles in and out: three successive mounds ofrubble and earth, approximately 6 feet high, with 100 metre gaps between them.All residents wishing to move in and out of the village—old or young, sick or well,pregnant or not—have to climb over the slippery mounds. At present, this policyseems to have been perfected to an extent that it can be further institutionalised bylong-term bureaucracy: a permit system, considerably worse than the “passlaws” imposed on blacks in Apartheid South Africa.96Little has changed since this assessment. Recently this state of affairs isbeing formalized by the construction of a series of security walls that not onlyfence in the Palestinians but also result in the effective seizure of land, especiallyaround Jerusalem.97 The wall encircles and isolates Palestinian villages anddivides properties and farmland in ways that make them inaccessible to theirowners.98The current state of affairs woul",0.4118

Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).Omar and Tlaib, the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, are outspoken critics of both Israel and Trump, and members of the so-called “Squad” of four progressive freshmen U.S. congresswomen — Omar, Tlaib and Reps.

To me, it seems clear that as US citizens make more in the form of wages, produce more in the form of productivity, and hence, consume more, inflation will be kept in check, GDP will increase and the deficit will ultimately decrease.

The goal was to ensure the department wasn’t violating a law barring U.S. security aid to foreign military units that commit serious human rights abuses.

He said in the sworn statement that he stayed silent for years because he's a military man, and ""when orders come, I follow them.""He said he felt compelled to ""share the truth"" following the publication of a recent book, The Liberty Incident, which concluded the attack was unintentional.The USS Liberty was an electronic intelligence-gathering ship that was cruising international waters off the Egyptian coast June 8, 1967.

Israel claimed its forces thought the ship was an Egyptian vessel and apologized to the United States.After the attack, a Navy court of inquiry concluded there was insufficient information to make a judgment about why Israel attacked the ship, stopping short of assigning blame or determining whether it was an accident.It was ""one of the classic all-American cover-ups,"" said retired Admiral Thomas Moorer, a former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman who spent a year investigating the attack as part of an independent panel he formed with other former military officials. The panel also included a former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, James Akins.""Why would our government put Israel's interests ahead of our own?"" Moorer asked from his wheelchair at the news conference. He was chief of naval operations at the time of the attack.Moorer, who has long held that the attack was a deliberate act, wants Congress to investigate.David Lewis of Lemington, Vt., was on the Liberty when it was attacked. In an interview, he said Israel had to know it was targeting an American ship. He said a U.S. flag was flying that day and Israel shot it full of holes.Israeli spokesman offers excuseThe sailors on the ship, he said, quickly hoisted another American flag, a much bigger one, to show Israel it was a U.S. vessel.""No trained individual could be that inept,"" said Lewis of the Israeli forces.Lyndon Johnson Ordered Cover-Up of Israeli Bombing Attack on USS Liberty in 1967 Six-Day Warhttp://educate-yourself.org/cn/coverup1967usslibertyattack22oct03.shtmlOctober 22, 2003http://www.theneworder.org/news/demandtoendlibertycoverup.htmOriginal TitleNavy men call for investigation of Israeli attack on LibertyLyndon Johnson ordered cover-up: Former Navy lawyerAssociated Press Wednesday, October 22, 2003WASHINGTON—A former Navy lawyer who helped lead the military investigation of the 1967 Israeli attack on the USS Liberty that killed 34 American servicemen says former president Lyndon Johnson and his defense secretary, Robert McNamara, ordered that the inquiry conclude the incident was an accident.In a signed affidavit released at a Capitol Hill news conference, retired Captain Ward Boston said Johnson and McNamara told those heading the Navy's inquiry to ""conclude that the attack was a case of 'mistaken identity' despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.""Boston was senior legal counsel to the navy's original 1967 review of the attack.

How did we shut our eyes and refuse to look squarely at our fate and see, in all its brutality, the fate of our generation? Let us today take stock of ourselves. We are a generation of settlement, and without the steel helmet and the gun’s muzzle we will not be able to plant a tree and build a house.

Normally, indictments follow the filing of charges by about four months.Prosecutors say the accused, which includes 12 couples, illegally obtained nearly $2 million in benefits by misrepresenting their income and failing to disclose income from numerous sources on applications for Medicaid, housing, Social Security and food assistance benefits.The arrests raised tensions in the town of Lakewood, which has seen a large influx of ultra-Orthodox Jewish families. Among those arrested were a rabbi and the former leader of a Jewish religious school.Incidents of vandalism were reported after the charges were announced in late June 2017. Flyers posted on cars around the town cited the arrests, and someone posted a banner containing an anti-Jewish slur on a Holocaust memorial",-0.981

(“The world rests upon three things, Torah, avodah, and gemilut hasadim.” Pirkei Avot 1:2) The term gemilut hasadim is distinctly post-biblical and occurs for the first time in the Mishnah. In the Babylonian Talmud, Sukkot 49b, a discussion is related defining chesed by contrasting it with the other fundamental Jewish value of tzedakah . Chesed is laid out as the broader value because it can be done not only with money, but also with one’s person. It can be given to the rich and the poor, the living and the dead. It furthermore states that, “The reward for charity depends entirely upon the extent of the kindness in it.”[The medieval commentator] Rashi’s comment on this line succeeds in communicating the essence of their thinking. He writes that the actual giving of money or goods is tzedakah, and the tirkhah (the care, the bother) is the hesed. For example, when a person takes the trouble to give a poor person money in a compassionate manner and at a time when the poor person can use it well, he or she has brought chesed to the act of tzedakah. Rashi further states that chesed is when you give your heart and mind to the well-being of the poor person. Chesed occurs when there is understanding between two people and when the command to “love your neighbor as yourself” is fulfilled (see Mishneh Torah, chapter 14).",0.9878

One depicted a coiled snake, with Mr. Rosenberg’s face superimposed on its head. ‘Nuchem Snake Rosenberg: Leave Tainted One!’ it said in Hebrew.

3514,"Where is the dam Sheriff????Welfare burden, tax fraud ""Kiryas Joel residents have been alleged to cheat on taxes by claiming that they have a temple, or a place of worship, in their homes.[citation needed] Obtaining tax relief as a house of worship means the property is excused from paying property taxes that support local services, such as public schools, roads, water and sewer, fire and police, and so on, including the funds which subsidize welfare payments.It is the custom in Kiryas Joel for women who work outside the home to stop doing so at the birth of their second child.[4] Most families have only one income and many children. The resulting poverty rate makes a disproportionate number of families in Kiryas Joel eligible for welfare benefits when compared to the rest of the county; and cost of welfare benefits is subsidized by taxes paid county-wide. Per the New York Times, because of the sheer size of the families (the average household here has six people, but it is not uncommon for couples to have 8 or 10 children), and because a vast majority of households subsist on only one salary, 62 percent of the local families live below poverty level and rely heavily on public assistance [government welfare], which is another sore point among those who live in neighboring communities.""I’ve always questioned their culture and how they lived. I’d never judge them, however they stand out alone when these issues come out into the open. With this community having and saved so much money, through tax exemptions, as well as buying property all over the state, how and why are they on Medicare and welfare? As many children as they bear, it’s no wonder that poverty sometimes comes into play. Or does it? I have mixed feelings about it.In an article in The Jewish Week of New York, they listed the scandal that rocked the community of Kiryas Joel. I knew eventually, their phony identifications would be revealed.",0.9502

3542,"Set my brother free question of Palestine, now in its 56th year without resolution, has been the oldest continuing item on theagenda of the United Nations. From the beginning, the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians has been asubject of concern, prayer and action for the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) as well as other churches and ecumenicalbodies in the region and the world. The church has shown concern for both the Israelis and the Palestinians. Ourdisquiet has been enunciated, as recently as a few months ago, when we protested attacks carried out against the Jews,their synagogues, and other institutions in various parts of the world. Our voice has been heard repeatedly on behalfof the suffering of the Palestinian people.Since the war of June 1967 and the occupation of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem, thatconflict has generally been characterized by violence. Except for a few periods when hope for peace seemed withinreach, the strife has only intensified. During the past thirty months, in particular, the degree of violence, fear, anger,polarization, and bitterness has been unprecedented. Many innocent Israelis have fallen victim to desperate acts ofterror at the hands of Palestinian extremists, while innumerable Palestinian civilians have experienced pain, suffering,degradation, and death under the yoke of Israel’s heavy-handed military occupation.The occupation is growing stronger, and the threat to Palestinian rights and Palestinian lives grows stronger, too.Despite this occupation that violates United Nations’ resolutions, which the United States affirmed, Israel claims moresupport than ever from the United States. Alongside its military and economic subsidies from Washington, amountingto a quarter of the entire U.S. foreign aid budget, Israel has requested an additional $4 billion in military aid, and $8–10 billion in loan guarantees from U.S. taxpayers. That money would help sustain Israel’s illegal occupation. Underthis occupation, Palestinian civilians suffer under twenty-four-hour-a-day shoot-to-kill curfews. Israeli settlementexpansion continues. Nearly 45 percent of West Bank land has already been expropriated from Palestinians forsettlement purposes. Arbitrary arrests, detention, humiliation, torture, and harassment continue to the point ofdesperation. Even U.N. staff members are not immune. Although it has spoken out, the church is often accused of being silent. Its call for justice and peace has continuedto go unheeded. Now it must speak up and speak out again, perhaps in stronger language. Its message is clear,consistent, and straightforward: it calls for the broad goal of ending the occupation, appeals with a most urgentpriority for international protection for Palestinians living under Israeli military occupation, and the protection ofinnocent Israeli citizens.

3677,"SOCIOLOGYHasidic families began migrating from New York City to suburban communities in the 1970s, hoping to create the sort of cohesive community some recalled from Europe.Rockland County, 15 miles (24 kilometers) northwest of Manhattan, now has the largest Jewish population per capita of any U.S. county, with 31%, or 90,000 residents, being Jewish. The ultra-Orthodox population is highly visible in small towns like Monsey, where bearded Hasidic men in black overcoats and fedoras converse in Yiddish along the sidewalks and Orthodox women wear modest black skirts and head scarves as they go about their daily errands.In small towns everywhere, resentment against newcomers and “outsiders” isn't uncommon. Proposals for multi-family housing complexes in sleepy communities of single-family homes often trigger fervent opposition complete with lawn signs and rowdy town board meeting crowds.Yet the tone of the debates over growth in some areas where Hasidic families have been moving has been more intense.In East Ramapo, there were legal fights after Hasidic voters, who generally do not send their children to public schools, elected a majority of members of the local school board.Some towns have enacted zoning changes forbidding new houses of worship.In the small town of Chester, 60 miles north of New York City in Orange County, New York Attorney General Letitia James recently announced action to fight housing rules that she said were being used to improperly prevent an influx of Hasidic Jews. Local officials have denied anti-Semitism was behind opposition to plans to build over 400 homes in the town of 12,000 residents.Rockland County Executive Ed Day said the arguments over housing density involve legitimate policy issues and are the biggest challenge when it comes to accommodating he growing Orthodox Jewish community.The Orthodox community has special needs, he said, like housing for large families and residences within walking distance to a synagogue. That creates ""demands that are counter to many of the communities they're residing in,"" Day said.Questionable zoning decisions, he said, lead to resentment.“Now the words start. Now the worst words continue. And this is where you have the problem,” Day said.Whether any of that heated rhetoric was a factor in the recent violence is unclear.Authorities haven't offered an explanation yet for what they think motivated the Jersey City attackers or Thomas to select their targets.Thomas' lawyer and fa",0.9706

3686,"SEARCH FOR TRUTH AT STAKEPart of the reason the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights reopened the complaint is because it recently made use of a general definition of anti-Semitism that policymakers have been developing over the past decade. While the classic anti-Semitism definition includes hatred toward Jewish people and the Jewish religion, the “new” version also incorporates hatred towards the Jewish state. The effort to define anti-Semitism more precisely with regard to the state of Israel includes what scholars have generally called the “three Ds” test: Delegitimizing the state of Israel, holding it to a double standard not expected from other democratic states, or otherwise demonizing it as a Jewish state.Yet many scholars, including a number of Jewish thinkers who’ve worked to crystallize these connections between politics and bigotry, say the “three Ds” definition was never intended to apply to the rough and tumble of academic debate and political engagement on college campuses, where freedom of speech remains a bedrock value critical to the educational process.“What this means is that students and professors who want to engage in legitimate conversations about the actions of the state of Israel, the founding of the state, and the idea of the state, are now going to feel threatened, feel very hesitant to engage in those questions,” says Barry Trachtenberg, director of the Jewish Studies Program at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C.“Universities ... draw students in who are at a moment when they’re trying to figure out their world, which means they’re going to ask questions that are often ill-defined,” he continues. “That may be clumsy. But to demonize them, to say that they’re engaging in illegal actions because they’re questioning historical processes and political decisions by governments, that’s very, very alarming to me.”Heated campus debatesProtesting Israel on campuses has intensified in recent years, and like most of American politics in the current era, the debates have often been heated and volatile.Students host “Israel Apartheid Weeks,” which often feature “checkpoints” simulating those in occupied Palestinian territories. Professors and academic departments, too, participate in the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, a Palestinian-led effort to ostracize Israel and galvanize international pressure to end the occupation.“Looking at the overall context of the situation, when is [anti-Israel or anti-Zionist sentiment] actually a camouflage for hatred of Jews?” says Susan Tuchman, director of the Center for Law and Justice at the Zionist Organization of America in New York, and one of attorneys who helped Kapoano and others bring their complaint. “It’s not always easy, especially for non-Jews, to discern when something does cross the line.”That is just one reason, she says, that the nation’s policymakers and civil rights enforcers need a more clear-cut definition of where that line falls.“Kids on campuses have to feel safe, they have to feel welcome, and that’s the real issue,” Ms. Tuchman says. “How do we ensure that, and how do we make sure that these students’ legal rights are protected?”In general, both Europe and the United States have seen a surge in expressions of anti-Semitism. In 2017, the incidents of anti-Semitism on college campuses rose to 204, up from 108 in 2016, according to a February report by the Anti-Defamation League. Earlier this week, anti-Semitic flyers were distributed on the University of California, Davis, campus and at several other colleges blaming Jews for protests against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. This fall, two instructors at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, reportedly withheld letters of recommendation from students after they learned they wanted to study in Israel.Kenneth Marcus, the current head of the Education Department’s civil rights enforcement division, said the agency used the working definition of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, a fully developed version of the “the Ds” idea, to reexamine the Rutgers case. The US State Department embraced a similar definition in 2010, and a number of government agencies and international organizations have also used it to clarify potential anti-Jewish hatred.Technically, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act covers on-campus discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or national origin – but not religion. Mr. Marcus and others, however, said that Title VI does cover any discrimination based on “actual or perceived” ancestry or ethnic characteristics, in which those who discriminate might conflate religion and ethnicity. This happens particularly towards Arab Muslims, Sikhs, as well as Jews. This was also the stated policy of the former Bush and Obama administrations. Questions about the government’s motivesCritics worry that the Trump administration has applied this definition to education policy not simply as a guideline",0.9968

Omar is one of the most progressive-liberal members of Congress,” Jacobs said. “She’s a fit for the district even if Democrats around the country are uncomfortable with her positions and her style.”Omar, a Somali American immigrant, became a national figure in 2018 as one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress. But her tweets last February insinuating that lawmakers support Israel because they have been bought off came under intense bipartisan criticism. She added fuel to the fire last March by suggesting that Jewish Americans have divided loyalties between the U.S. and Israel.Trump moved quickly to try to make Omar and three other freshmen congresswomen of color — known as “The Squad” — the face of his opposition, saying they should “go back” to their counties, even though only Omar was foreign born. His supporters chanted, ""Send her back!"" at a rally a few days later in North Carolina. But Omar received a hero’s welcome at the airport when she returned home from Washington that week.Trump's attention to Omar has helped her raise enormous amounts of money, and she's used the national stage effectively, Jacobs said.Omar raised more than $2.5 million through last year’s third quarter, the latest figures available, and had $1.56 million in the bank.

The 1967 dollar compared to 2017 dollar in today's dollar you would have to make $7.34 for every dollar you earned back then when, most worker's were making around $5-$6 per hour. Now multiply that out to see that blue collar middle class worker's would have to be earning between $35-$44 per hour today not counting benefit's, how many blue collar job's pay that today ? The answer is pretty close to ZERO, then you wonder why families and worker's are upset ? This is what's wrong with our country and economy if you want consumer's to consume, they live paycheck to paycheck now while desk jockies that don't produce a product make more than that, and then don't forget that CEO Pay use to be 100 times what their average worker made compared to what they do today 1,000 times plus.

3948,"Nettie bad news WorldIsraeli election: the left that dare not speak its nameReuters By Maayan Lubell,Reuters 7 hours ago . Reactions Reblog on Tumblr Share Tweet Email * Israelis vote in an election on April 9* The left once ruled Israel, right is now in power* Benjamin Netanyahu's main rival is a centrist* Israelis skeptical of peace prospectsBy Maayan LubellTEL AVIV, April 4 (Reuters) - When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to undermine his strongest election challenger, he pins a label on him that many Israelis see as an insult: ""Leftist.""Israel was founded by the left, which dominated politics in the early years of the state. In 1992 it took 61 of the 120 seats in the Knesset, or parliament.Nearly 30 years on, the left is forecast to take only around 25 seats in an election on Tuesday.The left has been reeling after a series of setbacks - the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, the failure of his 1993 and 1995 Oslo accords to deliver peace with the Palestinians, many rounds of failed negotiations and years of bloodshed that have made both sides bitter and mistrustful.Now, only 12 percent of Jewish Israelis identify themselves as left-wing, according to the Israel Democracy Institute. It was around double that a decade-and-a-half ago. Fifty-six percent now describe themselves as right-wing, up from 40 percent over the same period, and the amount who say they are centrists is little changed at 26.5 percent.With Netanyahu in power for the past decade and months away from becoming Israel's longest-serving leader if he is re-elected, the right is on the ascendant.The only candidate with a chance of beating Netanyahu is not a leftist. Benny Gantz, a former general and political novice, belongs to a new party that is running on a centrist platform.Seeking to win over right-leaning voters, Gantz, 59, has highlighted his military credentials and is a pragmatist.Gantz was head of the Israeli military during the 2014 Gaza war between Israel and the militant Islamist group Hamas in which 2,100 Palestinians were killed, against an Israeli death toll of 67 soldiers and six civilians.Gantz embraces that legacy, running a television ad which highlighted the number of Palestinian militants killed on his watch.Careful not to alienate centrist voters, Gantz also chooses his words carefully on the issue that more than any other divides Israel's left and right – a ""two-state solution"" for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Gantz nods to the left by saying Israel should pursue peace and end its dominion over the Palestinians but stops short of endorsing Palestinian statehood.Most polls show Gantz's centrist Blue and White party leading Netanyahu's right-wing Likud in a straight race. But they also show a Netanyahu-led alliance of all the right-wing parties is more likely to secure a majority.""TRAITORS""Netanyahu has cast Gantz as a weak leftist who will endanger Israel's security by giving territorial concessions to the Palestinians, which is anathema to the right.This is Netanyahu's standard play-book, say his opponents.""The word 'left' is a tool to delegitimize everyone or anyone who's against Netanyahu,"" said Labour lawmaker Merav Michaeli. ""'Left' has become like a curse, so it's not surprising that so many people are trying to avoid it.""""If there is really deep damage our prime minister has done to society, it's making the left-wingers traitors,"" said Labour supporter Liat Arbel. ""We are as (much a) part of Israel as right-wingers.""In the build-up to the election, Netanyahu struck an alliance with anti-Arab and far-right politicians, some of whom seek to annex the Israeli-occupied West Bank.Foremost among Netanyahu's critics",0.8579

Furthermore, righteous living involves us acting ethically--to be upright, just, and sincere. The commentator Nachmanides reminds us that tzedek tirdof challenges us to resolve conflict by compromising and teaches that being righteous is more important than the obligations of law. What is essential in being righteous and pursuing justice is our ability to act fairly and be inclusive of others. Because every human being is unique and was created b’tzelem elohim, in G-d’s image, they can make a positive difference and contribute to our world in special ways (Genesis 1:26). The value of tzedek tirdof lifts up the messages of the prophets who sought justice and fairness for all. Like the prophets of our Hebrew Bible, we too can question how the world is and what it ought to be. We can keep Divine expectations for a better world and better people at the center of our relationship with G-d. Furthermore, no one opinion is of greater importance than the other. In fact, in examining the phrase “Tzedek, tzedek, tirdof,” we learn that the phrase is in the singular. Therefore, each of us must pursue justice. When we do so together and act in righteous ways, the pursuit of justice may be fulfilled. As Pirke Avot teaches, “You are not required to complete the task, but neither are you free to desist from it.…” We do not need to complete the task of tzedek tirdof alone, but should do our",0.9897

4066,"TruthJohn Cusack blames 'careless mistweet' after being slammed for sharing 'disgusting' anti-Semitic image Erin Donnelly 4 hours ago Reactions Reblog on Tumblr Share Tweet EmailScroll back up to restore default view.John Cusack sparked outcry Monday night after retweeting an inflammatory image that has been slammed as anti-Semitic.The 52-year-old actor, who frequently posts about politics and social issues on his Twitter account, retweeted an image of a sleeve stamped with a Star of David, the hand jutting from it crushing a mass of people. Next to the image is the quote “To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize,” which, despite being mistakenly attributed to the philosopher Voltaire, is actually based on the writings of white nationalist Kevin Strom.Cusack added the remark, “Follow the money.” When critics slammed the “disgusting” tweet as anti-Semitic, Cusack insisted that he was speaking out against what he called Israel’s “state violence” against Palestinians, rather than criticizing those of the Jewish faith. He did acknowledge that the tweet, which he deleted, included an “alt-right” image. In another now-deleted tweet, he said that a “bot got me.” “I’m anti fascist-in every respect,” he added in response to the uproar.The Say Anything star’s explanation and blame on an alt-right bot did little to abate critics, who called on him to apologize. One commenter dubbed him the “thinking man’s Scott Baio” — a reference to the conservative ‘80s star — while Sen. Ted Cruz compared Cusack to Rep. Ilhan Omar, who was accused of an anti-Semitic tweet earlier this year. The backlash prompted Cusack to backtrack and express regret for the anti-Semitic messaging.""It's clear that even if it was Israel's flag and even if you don't have an anti-Semitic bone in your body, it is still an anti-Semitic cartoon,"" Cusack tweeted. ""Because it deploys anti-Jewish stereotypes in its attacks on Israel, even if those critiques about state violence are legit I mistakenly ... retweeted an alt-right account I thought was agreeing with the horrible bombing of a hospital in Palestine.""In reaction to Palestinian human rights under Israeli occupation, an issue that concerns anyone fighting for justice, I retweeted and quickly deleted an image that’s harmful to both Jewish and Palestinian friends, and for that I’m sorry,"" he continued.""The image depicted a blue Star of David, which I associated with Israel as their flag uses the same color and shape. I know the star itself is deeply meaningful to Jews no matter where they stand on Israel’s attacks on Palestinians. The use of the star, even if it depicts the state of Israel — committing human rights violations — when combined with anti-Jewish tropes about power — is anti-Semitic and anti-Semitism has no place in any rational political dialogue. To justify it would be as bad as conflating the cross with U.S. flag when confronting U.S. atrocities. So I get why it was a careless dumb thing to retweet.""",-0.9664

Last month, President Trump released his long-delayed “peace plan.”For months we have been clearly and consistently highlighting the red flags surrounding the development of this so-called plan: the exclusion of Palestinians from the process, the destructive steps taken by the Trump administration to put their thumb on the scales for Netanyahu, and the close ties between the plan’s authors and the Israeli settlement movement.The plan proved to be as reckless and dangerous as we expected. Rather than a genuine attempt to lay the groundwork for peace, the Trump team delivered a smokescreen of disingenuous talking points and details designed to distract from their true intention: to hand a political victory to Prime Minister Netanyahu and help pave the way for illegal, unilateral annexation of significant parts of the West Bank.With stakes this high, J Street was ready to respond. In the media, in our policy analysis and through our outreach to political leaders, we’ve played a decisive role in shaping the national conversation around this disastrous plan. We helped encourage presidential candidates to denounce Trump’s reckless moves and took action to ensure that members of Congress condemned the plan and warned against annexation.We’re going to continue to build a powerful drumbeat against Trump and Netanyahu’s “peace sham” -- while doing all we can to ensure that we can defeat the president and his agenda this November. In January, JStreetPAC announced a commitment to endorse the eventual Democratic nominee, raise over $1 million for their campaign and help organize American Jews across the country to get involved in the most important election of our lifetimes. Together, we’re going to transform American politics and lay the groundwork for a new, diplomacy-first era of US leadership in the Middle East.With your support, we can win this fight.Logan BayroffCommunications DirectorAROUND J STREETLeading the resp",0.9918

Deutsche provided Trump with millions in loans to build the crown jewel of his hotel chain, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, located a few blocks from the White House, but now, as president, his massive debt to Deutsche created an equally massive conflict of interest. The bank was already under investigation by the Justice Department for an alleged $10-billion scheme to launder money out of Russia. What would happen if Deutsche wanted to renegotiate one of its loans with Trump? What would Trump do if a decision involving Deutsche landed on his desk?“Even if there was no potential of financial scandal in all of this, it would be a problem that Trump is regulating a bank that he does business with,” says Tim O’Brien, executive editor of Bloomberg Opinion, author of TrumpNation, and an expert on Trump’s business career. “That in and of itself is a pure financial conflict of interest.”As president, nothing seems to get under Trump’s skin quite like bad news that involves his bank of choice. Trump told The New York Times in the summer of 2017 that then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller would be crossing a red line if his investigation looked into Trump’s and his family’s personal finances. A few months later, in response to news reports (later shown to be false) that said Mueller had sent subpoenas to Deutsche Bank, Trump told advisers that the Mueller investigation should be shut down.After the Times wrote a story about how Deutsche had become Trump’s lender of last resort during one of the lowest points in his bu",-0.6101

These were often strongly worded, politically charged statements that conveyed the Israeli narrative: “[Israel will] do everything possible in order to apprehend the despicable murderer”; “There is no justification for terror…This is not the path to peace!” “Hamas praises the killers and PA laws will provide them financial rewards. Look no further to why there is no peace.”By contrast, these AP reports rarely included statements by Palestinian officials condemning the killing of Palestinians, which would have provided another perspective for readers. For example, Fatah spokesman Osama Qawassmeh released a statement declaring that Israel was guilty of a long list of actions that “contravene international law.”Another Palestinian official condemned Israel’s “extrajudicial killings” and warned of Israel’s tendency to turn the West Bank into a “scene for escalation and security tension so as to pressure our people and leaders, and divert attention from colonialist expansion in our state.”Such Palestinian viewpoints, largely accurate and readily available, were never reported in the AP articles on deaths.",-0.7813

4176,"Goldman Sachs CEO: ‘Big Evolution’ Is Coming to Bitcoin Regulation“We continue to think about digital currency and the digitization of money in a very proactive way,” said CEO David Solomon.David Solomon is the CEO of Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon today said that he expects the digital currency world will experience a “big evolution.” Current regulations prevent the bank from acting as a principle around crypto, he said. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon has said that he thinks the Bitcoin and digital currency world will soon experience a “big evolution,” particularly regarding regulations in the United States. The head of one of the world’s biggest banks made the comments today during an interview with CNBC. He didn’t reveal much about what Goldman Sachs was doing when it comes to Bitcoin, suggesting that the current regulatory landscape in the US prevents the bank from doing so. But Solomon did make it clear that Goldman is keeping a close eye on crypto—due to growing client demand.""There are significant regulatory restrictions around us and us acting as a principle around cryptocurrencies like #bitcoin,"" says $GS CEO David Solomon. ""As our clients have demand to be involved in this space we can continue to find ways to support our clients."" “We continue to think about digital currency and the digitization of money in a very proactive way,” he said, adding that there are “significant regulatory requirements” concerning a move towards handling cryptocurrencies. Goldman Sachs plans to begin offering Bitcoin investment products to its wealth management clients, and it recently announced the reopening of its cryptocurrency trading desk.When asked if he would like to act as a principal with crypto services, and whether lobbyists in D.C. are having any luck getting “the rules changed” that prevent Goldman from doing so, he said: “I think that this is a space that is evolving, this is a space that we’re trying to be responsive to our clients. I think there will be a big evolution with how this evolves in the coming years.”He added that the bank was engaged with its clients and paying attention to regulations to see how to move forward. Regulations regarding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies remain complicated, as different government agencies pursue competing and sometimes contradictory positions on these assets. The SEC, for example, regulates the trading of securities and claims authority over most Ethereum-based tokens that were sold in the US as a way to raise funds for startups. The CFTC oversees the market for Bitcoin derivatives, such as futures and options contracts on exchanges like Bakkt and CME.Goldman Sachs will in one way or another expose its clients to Bitcoin. The firm last month filed an SEC application for a new investment product that tracks the ARK Innovation ETF—which is invested in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. The bank is the latest institution to express an interest, even if still cautious, in digital assets. Major banks have differing opinions on decentralized cryptocurrencies and are careful on how to approach and invest in them.",0.9988

Only Congress can authorize such a response — and they have not done so.“Just months ago, bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress voted in support of amendments to the NDAA clearly stating that President Trump is not authorized to launch a disastrous new war of choice with Iran. Congressional leaders must now include this provision — known as the Khanna-Gaetz amendment — in their final version of the legislation. They cannot allow this dangerous president to usurp their constitutional responsibility.“While the precise nature and origin of Sunday’s very serious attacks have yet to be definitively established, they help make clear the complete failure of the administration’s hyper-aggressive ‘maximum pressure’ campaign against Iran. By unilaterally violating a successful nuclear agreement and taking other reckless actions, the president has stoked tensions, undermined diplomacy and further destabilized the entire region.”",-0.9609

We'll stay in it forever.""The area was under heavy guard for the ceremony -- which also attracted other Israeli politicians -- with soldiers, explosives experts and sniffer dogs all present.The Palestinian Authority condemned his visit -- his first since 1998, according to Israeli media -- as ""provocative"" and politically motivated.""This is a purely colonialist, racist visit that Netanyahu is doing at the height of an election battle in an attempt to win votes from the right and the extreme right,"" the PA's foreign ministry said in a statement.Palestinian activists from Youth Against Settlements raised a giant Palestinian flag in the area.Palestinian youths threw stones and firecrackers at soldiers in the city centre who responded with rubber bullets, witnesses said.Israeli President Reuven Rivlin was among those attending and called for Israelis and Palestinians to learn to coexist.""Hebron is not a barrier to peace,"" he said.""It is a test of our ability to live together, Jews and Arabs, to live decent lives side by side.""After his address, Rivlin visited the site known to Muslims as the Ibrahimi Mosque and to Jews as the Cave of the Patriarchs -- revered by both faiths -- where he said a prayer, his office said.Netanyahu is fighting for reelection in a campaign in which settler votes will be key in his efforts to build a right-wing coalition.Hebron has seen regular unrest.",0.7331
