7,"Norwegian Cruise Line's DebtBased on Norwegian Cruise Line’s balance sheet as of May 15, 2020, long-term debt is at $8.43 billion and current debt is at $173.80 million, amounting to $8.61 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $1.36 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $7.25 billion.Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Norwegian Cruise Line has $16.46 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.52. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. For example, a debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry, whereas normal for another.",0.8264

It would make more sense for them (following your thinking) to just call it quits and file bk now. The fact that they secured ample backing for the next 18 months (although at a cost that will take some time to pay back) indicates they are serious about staying in this industry long term and feel the market will improve enough for them to survive even with the added baggage of Some share dilution and relatively high interest on the borrowed cash.

81,"""JD16 days agoReplied to a reaction$NCLH conversation@Tony max dilution is 20%. for PIPEs, anymore would require shareholder approval. recent PIPEs from other companies have been at a pps of 10-20% discount to recent share price. inline with the other cruise conpanies, i'd say NCLH is looking to raise 1.5-2 billion to shore up their liquidity to be able to weather a one year period with no revenue. of course, they did already draw on about 1.2 billion from a loan facility sometime in march. thus, i feel they only look to raise about 300-800 mil. 20% dilution on 200+mil shares at around $10-11 per share would result in about 350-500mil.20% dilution in exchange for possibly needed liquidity is fair. if this money keeps them alive until they can sail again, i'm all for it. stock was $60 4 months ago. factoring in current legit depressed price similar to the rest of the market, NCLH should be sitting with a 33-40% haircut from pre-covid highs. this means $35-38ish bucks. add in the dilution of 20% and the possible value when things are running should be around $28 bucks. of course, this is by no means a certainty. however, one thing that is certain is that the US can not keep this shut down going much longer. new cases are declining. the people need to go to work because the small government handout is costing trillions and Americans need to earn money for their next iPhones. if voters go into November destitute and hungry, trump knows he's gone. you think that narcissist is going to allow that? no way in hell...he's going to open as soon as he finds enough people to take the blame in case the reopen becomes a disaster.in short, the price should hold steady. i anticipate a $10-11 share PIPE. covid in the US is on downward trend. trump wants to open business ASAP. once that happens, the cruise line industry will petition hard to open business in 2nd or 3rd week of June if other businesses are up and running. furthermore, it does appear that trump is quite chummy with the cruise line for some reason.""shares priced @ $11 for $400mil. i was pretty spot on with the PIPE forecast of $350-500mil at $10-11 per share. haha, they actually got the high end of my estimate, so that's good. they borrowed more via bonds than i thought they would, but that's actually going to benefit them. CCL borrowed at 12%. NCLH is borrowing at 12.5%. better to have more money in case this grounding drags out past the 100 day CDC ban.if things go well mid-july and they are sailing again, then they may not have to use the excess funds and repay the bonds coming due in 2021.so far, things have un-folded as i predicted. if, by some stroke of luck, the cruise lines can convince trump to deal with the CDC to allow them to begin sailing near the end of june, we'll be golden. btw, i expect trump to put more pressure on the FDA to push more covid vaccine/treatment candidates through EU status. he wants/needs to get the economy going pretty soon. he's quite aware that his 2nd term hinges on this. i'd wager he fully opens up economy in 2-3 weeks with the restriction that businesses enforce mandatory face gear for the near term.",0.9975

While I don't focus on minute-by-minute price action, the impact on these stocks will be severe over time. I expect a haircut to current levels of approximately 25%-40% in the next 6 months and 15%-25% in the next 2 weeks. This short term hit will take, for example, NCLH to $39-$44 by March 1, 2020.

STOP ACTING LIKE THIS WAS SPANISH FLU!! This was a medium-low risk WHO-rated pandemic, where the cure was worse than the disease. This was not Armageddon. Everyone was not at risk. Not everyone died.

273,"Just read this from the July 16th Sec Filing""On March 14, 2020, concurrent with our and the broader cruise industry’s suspension, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(“CDC”) issued a No Sail Order through April 13, 2020. On April 9, 2020, the CDC modified its existing No Sail Order to extend it until theearliest of (a) the expiration of the Secretary of Health and Human Services’ declaration that COVID-19 constitutes a public health emergency, (b)the date the Director of the CDC rescinds or modifies the No Sail Order or (c) 100 days after the order appears on the Federal Register, whichwould be July 24, 2020. Based on the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect that the CDC will extend the No Sail Order beyond ourcurrently announced voyage suspension, which would result in an extension to our suspension of voyages. In addition, the duration of anyvoluntary suspensions the Company has implemented and resumption of operations outside of the United States will be dependent, in part, onvarious travel restrictions and travel bans issued by various countries around the world, as well as the availability of ports around the world.They expect that the CDC will extend the No Sail Order beyond there date of resumption. That could explain why Carnival just took out another loan and why Norwegian decided to announce an offering out of no where at the same time.

I commented in that post that the fifth wave had been weak but still had some more to go.We all know what happened then. On Mon. CCL cut some cruises and on TU RCL raised capital through a bond sale and stock offering. It appeared that the fifth wave was over when the stock hit 15.65 on Oct. 15. But the fifth and FINAL wave of this uptrend has reemerged as even more powerful than its predecessor. The intermediate term target box for this move is now 20.50 to 22.50 with most of the move coming during the upcoming week.The S&P model still has a target range of 3575 to 3650 before a step sell off interrupts the party. Once the sell off begins we are looking at a 15% to 25% decline with the higher decline more likely if we get to 3650.

And just when there will be sailing from U.S. ports again remains up in the air.Still, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH), the smallest of the three major U.S. cruise operators, could be an interesting play whenever North American operations do resume in 2021.“When we talk to the very large travel agencies, they tell us very clearly that the best booking/reservation demand for future cruises right now is on your higher-end, luxury cruises,” says Scholes, the Truist analyst. He has a Hold on Norwegian and peers Royal Caribbean Group and Carnival (CCL).Roughly 15% of Norwegian’s fleet capacity is dedicated to luxury, much higher than it is for Royal Caribbean and Carnival, Scholes says.Norwegian does have a lot of debt, including some taken on this year to stay afloat as its fleet sits idle. As of Sept. 30, its long-term debt totaled about $10.6 billion, up considerably from about $6 billion at the end of last year. And its recent valuation of 10.5 times enterprise value to estimated 2022 Ebitda is hardly cheap. Based on consensus FactSet estimates, the cruise operator isn’t expected to return to profitability until 2022.But the company’s luxury brands, notably Oceania and Regent Seven Seas, operate fleets with smaller ships, in many cases with under 1,000 berths—a potentially more attractive option to customers in a post-Covid world who want to avoid larger crowds. Those vessels, says Scholes, are “less crowded and cramped than a mass market three-days-to-the-Bahamas trip.”James Hardiman, a Wedbush analyst who rates Norwegian Outperform, observed in a recent note that the company “has positioned itself to eventually emerge from the pandemic and ultimately flourish.”https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/try-these-6-travel-and-leisure-stocks-to-play-a-vaccine-driven-rebound-in-demand-51608827667",0.9921

319,"Just to clear up some existing ignorance on this board about “the virus is mutating blah blah blah”. As an evolutionary biologist I’m best placed to point out how idiotic everyone’s views are here about how serious and harmful CV19 is. As I’ve already said, the mortality rate is very low, with the obese any preexisting conditions being the fall guys (plus a handful of the unlucky). For almost all of us, it’s a cough that budges after 2 weeks. End of. I don’t care what the news tells you, or some politician says. So, no, sorry it’s not the apocalypse. CV19 will mutate like all viruses or organisms may, but that doesn’t mean what the iconography of our cartoons portrays to us when we think about some nastier version of a boogeyman. When mutations occur enabling a virus to spread or survive, they are unlikely to make any difference in the course of an outbreak. Viral traits of infectiousness and severity are controlled by various genes, and each of those genes determine the virus' ability to spread in different ways. For example, a virus causing severe symptoms may be less likely to be transmitted when infected people are bed-ridden. So, these traits are like the coloured squares on a Rubik's cube, where a change in one characteristic will change another. The chances of a virus navigating such a complex series of stochastic trade-offs to become more severe during short timescales in an outbreak are almost impossible, because they are evolutionarily maladaptive for the most part. CV19 is subject to natural selection like we all are, but it already has a serious disadvantage due to existing limitations and host constraints. Soon it will be gone, as will it’s variations. The uneducated among you are the biggest risk to public health and the economy.",0.8992

The common stock has not been issued, yet, but at a $14 stock price, $350M would've been about 25 Million shares. Norwegian has about 215M shares out, so this would be just under 12% dilution. At $11.50, it would be about 30 million shares or about 14% dilution.At a minimum, the stock should be adjusted by the amount of dilution (12%-14%). The remainder of the drop is probably a bit of 'false' panic due to the headlines of 'bankruptcy' plus a little uncertainty until the capital raises are final. It looks like they have their earnings call within the week, so we will probably have most of the 'uncertainty' eliminated when that call happens.

424,"This is my fifth weekend post.First I want to thank all of you who had compliments about the previous post. I appreciate the commentsLast week I told you that the trading range was 17.10 to 20.00 and that ultimately we will be headed to a range of 30-32 in a month or two. I also told you that the CDC would likely issue a decision on the no sail ban between September 14-16 and predicted that the ban would be extended by 30-45 days. Finally, I told you that I didn't know if the correction was over but Tuesday and Wednesday would be important.Last week the high for the stock was 19.16 on Thursday and the low was 17.18 on Friday. We are going to slightly modify the trading range keeping the low at 17.10 but lowering the upper range to 19.50. Obviously, I am aware of the Astra Zenaga decision but do not believe that this will lead to a breakout above the trading range.The important thing to remember is that the tinder for the move to 30 is the massive short covering once a vaccine is approved. It is not likely that the mere resumption of clinical trials will cause the shorts to cover. All that has happened is that we are right back where we were ten days ago--the status quo if the trials hadn't been halted. I can forsee a rally tomorrow back to the top of the trading range but not a breakout. I still looking for a window of 30-32 for the price breakout but the time frame remains one to two months.The joint statement from the pharma companies that they won't be pressured by politics to see an early use exemption probably pushes us back a week or so.Finally, the structure of the sell off indicates that the down draft is not probably not over. We could see 3100 before the market begins a serious rally that can be sustained.I understand the overly optimistic projections but as I said this is a process and the accumulation/distribution line says the stock is not yet ready to move.

That and the ability to get people onboard without relying too heavily on air travel. Big ports like Miami will likely do better at this. Im in long with over 100k invested.

Based on this, I see 23% upside from here to return to NCLH valuation peak in early 2020 prior to covid. You may wonder how this can be the case given the stock price then was roughly $60 and is now $21. Here's my math.At the end of Q4 2019, NCLH had $253M cash, $746 current debt and $6055 long term debt for a net debt position of about $6.5B. They had 213M shares at $60 / share or an equity value of $12.8B. NCLH total enterprise value is $19.4BNow NCLH has $2,356M cash, $472M current debt and $10,465 long term debt for a net debt position of about $8.6B. After issuing the 40M shares, they will add about $800M cash to reduce their net debt to $7.6B but raise their share count to 315M. At $21 / share they have an equity value of $6.6B and added to the net debt figure they have an enterprise value of $14.2B. Finally, NCLH is now burning about $175M / month. Let's assume this continues for 9 months. That equals $1.6B of cash burn, thus increasing the current enterprise value to $15.8B.$19.4B / $15.8B = 23% upside from here or significant less than investors may be assuming just based on the current stock price, as that does not include the growth in shares from 213M to 315M and the growth in net debt.Again, appreciate any feedback on logic and math.

When it comes to pandemics bigger is not always better.NCLH ...although it has a smaller fleet it also has the newest fleet and it's a large enough company to attract very deep pockets, as we have already witnessed ...so I'm all in.Unfortunately cruise companies will be one of the last sectors to recover because of obvious reasons ...a few being the reliance on air travel for a large part of the recovery as well as public sentiment which they need to get beyond the left fear tactics and people need to believe in America again. We also will be reliant on protection from frivolous lawsuits that will be rampant if an 'indemnity bill' is not passed to protect from getting OR giving covid at port of calls, beyond reasonable care taken.The left has a stranglehold on most of the youth today as 80% of college professors are Democrats and the majority of the media are radical left-wing fear mongers and puppets for Pelosi snd Schumer.

743,"There is a fact to consider on this board: All non institutional investors have nearly zero impact on the price whether they buy or sell. Institutions own this stock and some big holders have exited and other big holders are bought them. The small investors stake has diminished as the price dropped. Usually small investors buy high and sell low.I took a position and averaged down in the range of 8 to 9. Shorts have been taken by surprise in the rally and rushed to cover. Now the price is at new highs. There are news Corona is slowing down. As the month of May approaches the price may pick up if the slowdown of corona is consistent. I stopped buying and will hold until 25+. It is hard to know how fast people will start cruising again. All depends of course on the defeat of the decease, new guidelines for cruising and the progress of the cure /vaccine. If the airlines resume flying, it is more likely that cruising will resume shortly after. If one can make reservations to fly in May or June then this is a sign of when cruising will potentially resume.",0.957

880,"Something that I believe is worth mentioning here because it's come up several times with new investors. And this is the group i'm more interested in helping.Many believe that if they pic a stock with a lower pps thats it's somehow better or 'more affordable' given the funds available to them... this is NOT the way to view buying stock. Its more about the % potential of gain the company has to offer. Observe the 1-5 year charts of companies and compare the highs of the companies you have interest in (especially over the lat 6 months).Example: Look at the overall pps of a company PRE-pandemic..Take NCLH...if you have $2,000 and buy 133 shares at $15 and then the stock goes to their original high of 60 (pre-pandemic), (which it will), you make just under $8,000. If you buy EVRI at $6pps (which i also own shares of) with that same $2,000 getting you 333 shares, and it moves to its pre-pandemic high of 14, you make around $4,700. My point is, don't focus just on pps, focus on the big picture where the company WAS and where it is now. But also be extremely mindful regarding the potential future the company has to offer. For example:... ERI (if all goes well) will merge with Caesars in June. Which will likely propel them to higher highs than pre-pandemic. PENN is ALREADY near its all time high pre-pandemic. Truly Amazing given everything going on.Having said that, I believe NCLH is an outstanding bet for the long run ...all things considered. The company had great posturing among the big-3 pre-pandemic and has the newest fleet. They were growing better and faster than expected pre-pandemic and imo NCLH offers the best cruise experience of the big-3. Although all 3 have unique qualities. (I've experienced all 3).When America calms down from this virus, and it WILL... NCLH will thrive again. Yes, it may take years to rebuild completely but the market is ALWAYS forward looking and a complete recovery will NOT be necessary for this to pay off BIG.Im long: NCLH..ERI, EVRI, PENN, SAVE, LUV, DAL, UAL, BOOT",0.9987

Following last week's capital raise, Norwegian is well positioned through 2021 to endure what will likely be a ""volatile elongated industry recovery"" that will keep cruise equities in broad trading ranges, Conder tells investors in a research note. While share downside is limited with its valuation at a 25% discount to the low end of historical averages, there is heightened risk of a second COVID-19 wave in the fall or winter which could impact demand as the industry tries to restart. The uncertain trajectory of when cruising will restart, degree of secondary COVID-19 waves over the next 12-18 months, consumer demand recovery, and competitive actions within the industry will produce share price volatility within a broad trading range, contends Condor. With that said and despite the downgrade, the analyst believes Norwegian Cruise Line is positioned favorably relative to some competitors.Read more at: https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3092949",0.852

What Biden and the Democrats don't understand is you do not increase wealth or income to the states and government treasuries by raising taxes... it never works. That's why socialism ALWAYS fails after the first year.Those of you Democrats on this board that keep thinking that Biden is your savior do not understand what you are doing by voting for higher taxes and even if you don't fall into that tax bracket which 90% of you do not ...you need to take in the consideration all of the people that work for these corporations, because if they're making less money they then spend less money.Wake up America..",0.967

The news outlets are falsely reporting as if there's a hard line in the sand but the conditional sale and requirements have not changed they're still in place and can be met. The outlets are trying to make it seem as if no sailing can happen until November 1 and that is simply untrue.The thing to keep your eye on is the public health emergency declaration which started in January 2020 and is supposed to get updated every 90 days and it was last updated on January 21st 2021. So the next date of primary concern is April 21st. That is the date that the public health declaration is set to expire. If that expires cruising can continue unabated and the CDC's conditional sale order will be no more. However even if it is extended from April 21 that then takes us to July ...90 days out which was the target window to start back sailing anyway.Currently Royal Caribbean is sending voyages out of the Bahamas and many other cruise lines are doing the same.I would expect Norwegian to look into this as an outlet as well. Also Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Disney have not canceled their June itineraries even though Norwegian did earlier.This entire Covid experience has come down to a political arm wrestling match over power. let's hope that the B administration will want to take a victory lap because the numbers are showing this Covid 'pandemic' should come to a close.Pressure is going to continue to mount exponentially now on the CDC through these billion dollar cruise industry especially through Florida governor Ron DeSantis and senators from Alaska taking action pursue suing the CDC now over there outdated model to resume cruising.Extremely frustrating to all of us not just investors but to the tens of thousands of jobs that are all waiting on the resumption of cruising.",0.9901

This report took a long time to see the light which means that the cruise lines have been extremely cautious to insure public safety and used experts to draft these 75 recommendations. It is important to mention that the cruise lines chose to postpone their dates beyond the CDC date for public safety reasons. The fact that the CEO of Norwegian is confident about sailing again means a lot. It will be interesting to see if the the CDC would extend the no sail order and give some general arguments like they did in the past for other matters. For instance, It took the CDC long time to decide about the mask and changed their mind back and forth. The Airlines resumed their flights and why not the ships. Maybe it is political and after November the CDC won't have a reason anymore to deprive many businesses from resuming. If it is political then there will be no sail before November. If it is not political then the rebuttal of the report will have to use facts and data to show credibility.

People that see the vaccine is more likely, will start hunting for deals in the market before the investors that need less risk, and really, the deals that are left are banks and travel and leisure, casinos, cyclicals, etc. Behind this will be a massive, world wide wave of optimism that things will be returning to to normal. When the vaccine is out, and proven effective, there will be a world wide party the likes of which we haven't seen. This will create buy pressure everywhere, and massive optimism. Tech stocks are also due for a pretty decent correction, money is going to rotate out of them and that money will also be looking for a deal. Stimulus money is coming back into the market soon, that will be largely retail investors looking for cheap stocks, again, buy pressure.

Add to this, that in these cruise stocks, institutions are controlling nearly 90% of the float for most of the cruise stocks, and some these stocks have almost a 20% short interest.

The trading of the small investors has no effect on the stock price simply because institutions own nearly all the shares.

Like the train needs a powerful engine, this stock needs a wave of institutional buy or sell to move up or down. It seems that the price is still way down from the levels of 55 and 60. This explains in my belief the uptrend which I expected would happen very fast. Those who bought at the lows made obviously a good return on investment. When will the uptrend slow and at what price. It is hard to predict or speculate because all depends on when business resumes. It also depends on the company's balance sheet and for how long it can sustain with no revenues.

""Those who will require medical help will receive it.” President Donald Trump said he would have preferred not to let the passengers disembark onto American soil but would defer to medical experts.In Egypt, a cruise ship on the Nile with more than 150 aboard was under quarantine in the southern city of Luxor after 12 positive tests.Also Saturday, the port of Penang in Malaysia turned away the cruise ship Costa Fortuna because 64 of the 2,000 aboard are from Italy. The ship had already been rejected by Thailand, and is now heading to Singapore.And in Malta, which reported its first case of the virus Saturday, the MSC Opera ship agreed not to enter the Mediterranean country’s port amid local worries — even though there are no infections suspected on board. The ship continued to Messina, Sicily, where passengers were allowed to disembark after officials reviewed medical records.I believe all 3 cruise lines drop another 10 % Monday",0.9928

First is that our book of business entering the year was so strong that adjusted for the redeployment of Norwegian Spirit, our book position and pricing remains slightly ahead of this time last year on a comparable basis.This strong book position demonstrates a strong demand and fundamentals of our business, the volume of our advanced bookings and the potential for outsized returns when business comes back to normal.Second, onboard revenue per sailings outside of Asia continued to perform above last year's record levels and better than our current year expectations demonstrating that any consumer concerns does not extend once guests are on-board.Third, the sale of future cruises onboard to guests currently sailing continue to exceed both prior year record levels and current expectations.And lastly, and perhaps most importantly, in the previous 5 days, we have seen an improvement in week-over-week booking volumes and a decrease in cancellations when compared to the prior 3 weeks.

This destruction in our cities is absurd and the mental midgets behind it need to be thrown in jail. Just my opinion.Having said that ..what happened to Covid coverage?? The media has moved onto the next tragedy.America CAN re-open and it's obvious because thousands of people are shoulder to shoulder in the streets (without masks) over the last several days over this Floyd issue (bad and good) and mark my post that Covid cases will most likely NOT spike. It's because the people on the streets are NOT nursing home patients.America was founded on risk and I do NOT consider where 99% of Americans to be UN-affected by a particular virus a big enough risk to CONTINUE to shut down the most powerful engine on face of this planet. We now know who the venerable are. Its no longer a mystery.The bigger risk is keeping this country shut down. Thousands of people in Caribbean islands rely on American dollars through the cruise industry. Thats just one example.We all know who the vulnerable are and we can protect them ...the other 99% of America can get back to work today.A simple 'indemnity bill' can protect a variety of businesses from frivolous lawsuits against 'giving or getting' Covid ....and in regards to NCLH, at 'port of calls.' Walmart doesn't have an indemnity bill but yet thousands go in and out of their doors every day and not just to buy food. Any lawsuits?? No.This Covid issue is sadly 90% political.

1310,"With recent intrigue in ship stocks centered around cruise lines such as Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH) Carnival Cruise Lines (CCL) and Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines (RCL) Tanker ships are being overlooked. Maybe it's time to take a look at one in particular that is absolutely beating earnings by far and poised to double in share price quickly. Teekay’s tanker fleet (TNK) isn’t a just used to transport oil — it’s also used to store oil when supply exceeds demand. Either way, Teekay gets paid. And in the company’s first-quarter results, you would be hard-pressed to see any ill effects from the pandemic or the oil price war: “In the first quarter of 2020, Teekay Tankers achieved its highest quarterly adjusted profit in more than 10 years, with adjusted net income of approximately $110 million, or $3.27 per share, and I am pleased to report that our fleet has continued to secure strong spot rates in the second quarter of 2020 to-date.”In addition, the company is aggressively eliminating debt. It sold off several under-utilized ships to help pay $200 million of its debt during the quarter, knocking that down to $730 million.After several flat years, TNK stock began to rise dramatically toward the end of 2019. It has had a tumultuous 2020. With a recent concensus price target at $26 TNK is in position to double it's share price quickly.https://investorplace.com/2020/06/7-a-rated-growth-stocks-to-buy-today/",0.9847

It was the weekend it broke out he states the industry will not come back k that quick. Stick quickly retraces to $10 and Buffett loads up. Then 2-3 weeks later the stock climbs again and breaks above That $17 mark again. I thought Buffett said 3 weeks earlier it will take years to recover? But less then 3 weeks?

Some of those very people are bloggers for bigger outlets and write articles to sway sentiment. People need to pause and really think about this. Is NCLH going to go up in price per share? YES, when will this happen? As soon as the no sail lifts it will jump up dramatically. What about until then?

1363,"￼copy/paste...Thoughts on this?JASON LEPPERTCruise EditorSHARE Is CDC Discriminating Against the Cruise Industry?Jul 06, 2020￼Many members of the travel industry are pushing for cruising to resume.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), not the cruise lines themselves, is at fault for sustained sailing suspensions.At least that is the opinion of Harry Curtis, an analyst for Instinet, a stock trading system. “This issue is not that the industry has been passive in developing health protocols,” Curtis is quoted as saying. “In our view, the hurdle lies with CDC’s unwillingness to discuss, debate and mutually implement the highest standards of passenger and crew health care.”This is occurring while resorts, casinos and other forms of mass transportation — particularly flights with increasing passenger count and reinstated middle seat sales — are increasingly permitted.Scott Pauley, press officer for CDC, explains that the maritime environment is unique. “The population density on cruise ships tends to be higher than most urban settings, and even when populations are reduced, we still observe ongoing spread of COVID-19 illness due to the congregated setting and greater chance of closer physical contact,” Pauley said. “Sailings without guest passengers and with a markedly reduced crew size since April have continued to prove how difficult it is to control and eradicate COVID-19 infections and outbreaks in the maritime environment.”Sailings without guest passengers and with a markedly reduced crew size since April have continued to prove how difficult it is to control and eradicate COVID-19 infections and outbreaks in the maritime environment.Despite surveys suggesting that cruise demographics are changing as younger travelers opt to sail, CDC is also concerned about how vulnerable older cruisers could be to the virus.“Persons over 65 with underlying health conditions (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular illness, malignancy, liver disease, kidney disease, obesity, etc.) are at much greater risk of more severe illness with possible hospitalization and, at times, a need for respiratory support (some form of oxygen) in an ICU setting,” he said. “The guest profile on typical cruise ship voyages matches those at greatest risk for severe illness, which may require hospitalization and need for respiratory support.”As it currently stands, CDC’s No Sail Order technically expires on July 24. However, the day after an expected meeting between the government organization and cruise companies, Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) announced continuing a suspension of operations until Sept. 15.Although this industry update was made voluntarily, one can suspect timely pressure. CDC’s silence — save for a color coding system to allow commercial crew repatriation and concurring with said extended passenger suspension — suggests it is not receptive to health and safety plans being presented by cruise lines for guests to return.Travel agents agree.“I do blame CDC if the cruise lines have submitted their protocols and complied with what they were asking for,” said Adam Martindale, a Cruise Planners advisor at Martindale Travel and Tours. “If the cruise lines have submitted all the required paperwork by the requested dates, then I don’t understand what’s taking CDC so long in order to get at least one cruise ship for each cruise line started up again — even if they were only to go to the private islands and islands that are opened up to tourism, and be very controlled to start the cruise industry again. Cruising is vitally important to the travel industry and economy in many states and cities.”Danny Genung, CEO of Harr Travel, points to the American Society of Travel Advisors’ (ASTA) frustration with CDC.“I stick 100% with ASTA,” he said. “CDC needs to let us know what it looks like to travel and to set the expectations and guidelines so that millions of people out of work can at least understand what needs to happen to get back to work.”CDC needs to let us know what it looks like to travel and to set the expectations and guidelines so that millions of people out of work can at least understand what needs to happen to get back to work.",0.9986

On April 9, 2020, the CDC modified its existing No Sail Order to extend it until theearliest of (a) the expiration of the Secretary of Health and Human Services’ declaration that COVID-19 constitutes a public health emergency, (b)the date the Director of the CDC rescinds or modifies the No Sail Order or (c) 100 days after the order appears on the Federal Register, whichwould be July 24, 2020. Based on the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect that the CDC will extend the No Sail Order beyond ourcurrently announced voyage suspension, which would result in an extension to our suspension of voyages. In addition, the duration of anyvoluntary suspensions the Company has implemented and resumption of operations outside of the United States will be dependent, in part, onvarious travel restrictions and travel bans issued by various countries around the world, as well as the availability of ports around the world.The no cruise will be getting extended, thus the offerings to raise cash that they're bleeding daily.

We look forward to seeing their fleet back on the high seas.”AtmosAir’s patented bi-polar ionization technology continually and proactively attacks coronavirus and other viruses, bacteria, spores and volatile organic compounds quickly and effectively in the air and on surfaces, rather than requiring the air to be filtered out first. The technology works by releasing ions through the HVAC system, and these ions bond with viruses, breaking down their cellular structure and rendering them harmless. AtmosAir is providing cleaner air using a safe, natural and environmentally friendly process and helping protect cruise ships, airports, casinos, sports facilities, educational institutions, commercial buildings and a host of other spaces where people live, work and enjoy themselves worldwide with more than 7,500 locations across the globe currently using this technology.",0.9957

Only trust the chart.The day I committed to doing that was the day I started building my account consistently. I make money every week through longer term, swing and day trading. That's the honest truth.Here's what the chart for NCLH shows. This is not ""my opinion"", this is the chart.The floor for NCLH is $7.00. There are falling tops which are a concern. Falling tops right now are $24.09, $20.28, $14.31 and $14.18. This pattern is following a down trend to the floor, $7.00 in a pennant pattern.Shorting at these levels would give a very limited return in my opinion, but I would not be long either until this down trending ends. NCLH needs to breakout of the down trend on price and positive volume. I, like anybody else, do not enjoy being in the red. It's hard to look at every day, affects moods, appetite, sleep and relationships. If you can afford to be in this long term, of course accumulating at these levels is a good idea.Right now the chart also shows great uncertainty.

1509,"I'm going to do a quick post to my fellow retail investors, that are not shills for some hedge group or bots, but just average folks trying to set up a potion. What I've noticed for over a month $NCLH, $CCL, and $RCL, really, all Covid-19 impacted stocks, airlines, casinos, etc, but specifically the cruise stocks have been on a down trend. For the last month, especially the last few weeks, they have been trading on very low volume. $NCLH, whcih I have been watching very carefully, has been acting like it has found strong support around 13 a share, and appears to be re-coupled mostly with the market. Why does it matter?I suspect we're seeing a bottom for these stocks, or somewhere near it, and we're going to see a trend change soon, and it will be on full daily volume. Why? I suspect the downward sell pressure in these stocks are weak retail longs selling off, and not institutional investors. Why are they weak and retail? ...because the drop has been painful, but the pain is short term, and it's mostly retail as institutions still hold close to 90% of these stocks. Why short term? Because Covid-19 cannot physically last forever, based on the data. Why do I say that? ...because I've been watching the numbers. The numbers of cases growing, some of the hotspot states, like Florida, California, even Arizona, appear, to be leveling off. I really don't understand why, if it's legitimate or manipulation, and why it isn't being more talked about in the media. Yes, the overall numbers of cases is bad, it's ...really bad. But it's not ""as bad"" as it was a week ago, or two weeks ago, or three weeks ago in some of the states that are supposed to be out of control. As investors, we trend to recognize these trends. If you don't believe me, just google it for yourself. It's like unemployment, it's bad, but, arguably, it's less bad than it was the week prior, and the week before that. When the cases went down before, we saw a HUGE upsurge in these stocks Covid-19 impacted stocks. Then the cases went up and these stocks started to drop...but now, they are going down again. Again, check yourself, let the numbers convince you. This time, we will have both declining cases and vaccines around the corner, no less than five promising candidates in Phase III human trials with results due Oct/Nov. There's also ENORMOUS political pressure to leak positive vaccine results to the markets before the US election, for obvious reasons. I'm not telling you what to do with you money, and I'm not saying this isn't all ""baked"" in. I don't think it is, as new agencies are just now starting to pick it up. You make your own call. I reposition more heavily in some of these Covid-19 stocks myself. I'm only typing this as it's fun to chat about stocks, but also just in case, it gives some investor out there like me another puzzle piece to add to their own strategy. Hope this helps.

I've even cruise the Paul Gaugin in Tahiti. The only time any cruise line stole from me was the one time I cruised with Norwegian. After leaving 2 dive bags outside my cabin in Puerto Rico the last evening of the cruise, the next morning we disembarked to find all of our luggage in the designated area except for the two dive bags. All I could do was file a missing luggage report before catching the shuttle to the airport. NCLH has crooks working on their ship. Fortunately my accountant told me the loss might be covered by my homeowners insurance and it was so I basically got all new equipment back. The dive shop was glad to issue me receipts for all my past purchases. Now with these short sales I'm way ahead of the theft.

But if you think about this, the people who are going to take advantage of this are going to be young families, the ones that have the least amount of disposable income to spend, because those who are most vulnerable to Covid are the older travelers and they’re going to be much less likely to take advantage of these offers.”",0.9065

And ERI is already at 36+ which is OVER half way back to their ALL TIME high of near 70.NCLH will follow this trend in very short order.Seasoned investors are comfortable making a 'long term' return rather than daily 'chasing'. Its why they enter and STAY in... even when their entry point was not optimal (rarely is)....Sure, buy dips if you can, but maintain original buy-in long position for the most part. Focus on the bigger picture. For NCLH, it's likely well north of $40 in the next 8 months and upwards from there as cruising will steadily resume to full capacity. The excitement of wealth alone will drive this stock north.In watching wealthy friends amass serious money over the years, I observed their techniques and they do NOT 'white knuckle' their finger over the sell and buy button on every rise and fall of a stock.When you have little wealth, the desire to squeeze every $$ out of a trade looms constantly.....therein lies the stress of 'chasing' ups and downs which many are likely doing ... it's also why many fail to make serious $$$.Move into a LONG position and stress less. NCLH is a very solid company with a solid balance sheet. NCLH stock is not down because they ran the business poorly. The point is that the core company STILL exists, assets and all. As does their cruise base. They've secured $$$ to last 18 months with ZERO revenue! What more could you ask for? The logistics of filing chapter 11 (corporate reorganization) is a nightmare for a company like this between their assets and large investors,... they WILL avoid it like the plaque.Yes, NCLH added debt, so did Casinos. Much of it is collateralized by NCLH's vast assets including 2 private islands. Once sailing resumes, and it WILL. Serious money WILL flow again. If sooner, then they can use the $$ raised to pay down debt. They're also adding additional ships (which are being built) to their existing 28 ships spread over their 3 brands.....•Norwegian Cruise Line •Oceania Cruises, and •Regent Seven Seas Cruises. NCLH has the NEWEST fleet and the smallest fleet,..which is a GOOD thing, as their overhead is far less than RCL and CCL.Investing is a mindset.. plain and simple. Adopt what I'm sharing and focus on the big picture, and making money will be less stressful. This GLOBAL pandemic (which China IS responsible for ...plus Hong Kong tensions ..plus the Floyd incident and needless destruction..etc etc..) has ALL presented a unique opportunity (sad though it all is) for creating wealth here.Soon NCLH will STAY heading up. Those who continue playing the swings with 100% of holdings, may wake up one morning soon and realize they MISSED the boat. If you capitalized on swings here and your 'crystal ball' is working properly, hats off to you. If you do play swings, consider keeping 70% of your position LONG and use 30% to try to buy/sell to lower your basis... IF you loose that 30%, DO NOT dip into your 70% LONG position.I've sat down to dinner with wealthy friends and discussed a stock we're all in and they say...""oh yeah....It'll be fine.. just give it a few months.. hey I've got an 11am T' time Saturday, who's in?""... and that's how the conversation goes. Six months later, they take profits...'rinse and repeat.' (In this case with NCLH hold up to a year or more depending on your tolerance level. The longer you hold this one, the more you will make. The DOW WILL exceed 30,000 easily when Trump is re-elected.(my opinion).Many say...""i could've made a killing if I bought that dip at 10 and sold at 18....so true but only God possesses that gift. How many say...""damb, when i sell.. it goes up !!...and when i buy ..it goes down""... folks, FEW catch these waves and following cheerleaders is equally futile. In this unique environment, swings do seem more predictable (short term) as the ENTIRE market (in general) swings in tandem with 'public sentiment'. Having said that, my advice is pick a long position NOW (if you haven't already) with at least 70% of your $$$ and play with the other 30% for another month or two.Not easy watching your 16/pps buy-in drop to 10....it's nerve racking. Or going to 18+ as excitement fills your veins and temptation to sell grows. How do you feel when you sell and it continues to go up? Coulda-woulda-shoulda.. Stay focused on the big picture. You WILL have more peace of mind. (And you won't need heart surgery before your 50..lol...and no, that didn't happen to me).I hope this helps some.

The new interest payment for the $675m senior notes due at 12.25% interest rate will take a toll on the future income not forgetting the impact on recovery due to covid.Taking into account all of these, adjusting for interest payment and share dilution, at the price of $25, we are at around $38(pre-covid levels).

1662,"Since it is hard to find factual information (or opinion) on this forum here is litte piece of information that may not be available for everyone. My father-in-law owns a Expedia Franchise for Cruise Center which cover the greater Montreal Area, in Quebec (Canada). He told me this weekend that he was able to hire back 50% of his travel agent now and that booking for the holiday cruise 2020 are full already. (I myself am going on one of these with my family). Now, while I understand that there is going concern for their financial situation, given the information above, it is my personal belief that bankruptcy is highly improbable. Also, you may remembered that Fauci himself told the general public that a vaccine is expected by the end of 2020 or early 2021; well before our 18 months potential deadline. Hence, leaving as potential only risk the debt burden and the interest that goes with it. Even if this impact their profit margin, I highly doubt that it would affect it to the point of being negative and note that it will affect the entire cruise industry. Given the fact that it affect the whole industry, the natural response to this will only be higher price for cruise, which I doubt it will ponders the demand as people have been holding back travel budget for 2020. I have no pretention that I am a better investor than anyone else, but I am confident that 90% of the people here are also average trader like me. Hence, they too can't perfectly predict the direction of the price in a market that is evolving in minutes timeframe. My strategy here is admitting that I can't predict it perfectly and simply averaging down. I sold at 25.00$ my initial 2,000 shares bought at 9.65$ average and I have been looking for another entry point since. I still believe in the fundamental given a 1 year or 2 horizon and thus I have bought back an initial 400 shares at 17.00$ and yesterday another chunk of 500 at 15.75$. My next target would be around 12.50 (if it ever goes there) to buy another round of 600 shares.

Biden wins, endless lockdowns to destroy small businesses).Is it zero cases?The only way that will happen is if we just stop testing and stop reporting. Which in my opinion is what we probably should do. Enough of this testing already...A huge number of people apparently aren't smart enough to understand positive testing doesn't equal to deaths... so the only way to calm the doom and gloom side of America down may be to simply quit testing.... OR get rid of the corrupt main stream media. How many of you got tested for the swine flu?, or get tested for tuberculosis or the common flu on a regular basis?So very convenient for a particular political party that Covid just happened to come about the very year of a critical election. HummIs a vaccine even going to end covid?....noIt took 25 years for a chicken pox vaccine to be developed.The smallpox inoculation was discovered in 1796 the last known natural case was in 1977.We have a flu vaccine that is only 40 to 60% effective and less than half of the US population choose to get one, and roughly 30,000 Americans will die of the flu or flu complications EVERY year.We already have a growing number of anti vaxxers refusing proven, tested, well known vaccines that have been administered for decades but aren?t necessarily safe!Do you really think people will flock to get a fast tracked, quickly tested vaccine, whose long term side effects and overall efficacy are anyone's best guess? How long are we going to cancel and postpone and reconsider?You aren't doing in person school until second quarter?...third quarter? EVER?? And this is with a virus that has basically zero effect on people under 25!!When do we decide quality of life outweighs the less than 1% risks? We all understand that Covid can be deadly or dangerous for SOME people...VERY FEW PEOPLE actually...but so are strawberries and shellfish.....We take risks multiple times a day without a second thought.....When and how did we so quickly lose our free will and give up our liberty? I'll tell you how ...election season... and fraudulent fear mongering left-wing media and allowing corrupt governors and mayors to take over your lives for power grabbing.....that's how.I understand that there is a minuscule possibility I could die, actually its far less than 1%, and that's IF I actually contract the virus......but if i do, I will most likely just end up feeling like #$%$ for a few days..... I also understand I could possibly pass it to someone else, but I can pass on any virus onto someone else, like the flu or other issues like tuberculosis or any number of other complications we humans face on a regular basis.....Where or how does this end?We either get busy living or we stay occupied with worrying about dying. You have a better chance of getting hit by lightning if you're under 65 than dying by covid.

I am sure that these ships will be the cleanest anyone has seen them and protocol will be near perfect anyway, but with Covid on a dramatic decrease by then and possibly most if not all on board vaccinated, the whole cruising experience will be on it's way back to normal again and they will start to make money again, and our stock will be only going up.",0.9945

Biden said a $15 mandatory minimum wage would NOT hurt small businesses..Another huge LIE....... Biden said no one lost their healthcare coverage because of Obamacare..huge LIE...

1862,"I am on the sidelines like many of you. I am very much watching the stock prices of these cruise lines, though. I am a former auditor and I cannot avoid my bias towards the book value of a stock. I am the opposite of a momentum trader in other words. The move this morning put the stock price of NCLH in line with its book value for the first time in... I cannot find when they were last in line. That may seem like the perfect time to dive in. Here is what is giving me pause. The entire cruise industry has been bullish in their posture at managing cash. In other words, they are focused on growth rather than rainy day fund accumulation. For NCL, the current ratio is around .20. In other industries (and during one of my audits), this would be considered an 'item of concern'. While you might say that is 'better' than peers, the entire industry is aggressively growth oriented with their cash. The comment I hear is, ""Well, there may be some pain but the cruise industry isn't going away"". Yes, but do not dismiss the pain that may occur. NCL has around $250m in cash. In the short term, that has to service I believe around 746m in debt this year (that is the current one year portion of the debt). On the positive side, the year end balance sheet that informs my analysis shows balances at the very low end of the business cycle. Cash swells when the season is in full swing. The problem, this year, is that we don't know how many discounts will have to be given and how much. That swell will be more limited.You can at some level restructure debt. You can give credits to existing customers to bring them back the next year. There just is not a lot of breathing room with their cash level (no pun intended). When you are strapped for cash and are a corporation, you begin to look at issuing new securities or new debt to ride out the crisis. Both of those events would do terrible things to the aforementioned book value.While I know a stock crashing (literally as I type this it dropped .77) does not encourage polite debate, I am hoping that we can keep this on a level that is respectful. My analysis could be overblown, showing a huge blind spot, or missing a great investing opportunity. I encourage you to respond if you disagree (or agree). I will possibly be bullish at below $20 and will add to my position as a slow buy over several weeks)",0.9916

A lot of commentators are saying its too big a self harm for US businesses when the economy is already so bad. Trump going ahead with this will definitely damage US business which most people are saying is inconceivable in an election year. Others are saying, this is Trump and his only concern is being re-elected - above the US economy hence he may just pull the trigger and markets will tank.

This would mean aproximately from the current number of infection 2,142,000 aproximately this number needs to increase to 198,000,000 which seems highly unlikely based on current daily compounded increases. I am not sugesting that one should not take care as it is a concern for sure and we are all at risk and not good but at the current time the percentage is not close to expert prediction. No one knows for sure how long it will last or if we get second or third wave or not or if we get a vacination for sure or not so offcouse we all take risks with this one but the rewards can be substantial.

I do believe that if NCLH can survive bankruptcy they will one day be a profitable company but they are in for a world of hurt for the near future. My strategy is as follows 1) I’ve already secured a short position. 2) I’ve secured a call option to hedge my short portion. 3) When the stock tanks over the next week or so I may add to my short position. 4) When NCLH nears what I would identify as a bottom I’ll sell my short position and use the profits for step 5. 5) Purchase NCLH with newly acquired profits essentially creating a “free roll” and pray bankruptcy doesn’t occur. 6) Hold position long and in about two years I’ll sell and maybe take a cruise on Norwegian and possibly even get a deluxe room with my newly acquired wealth.

2051,"I hope you are all helping someone today.Having said that,...In all my years I have never experienced such abuse by one political party than what the Democrats are doing with this Covid virus.Serious minds are not saying Covid does not exist ...that would be absurd. But what calmer minds are saying is that this virus affects less than 1% of the entire population in a serious adverse way.And of that percentage the vast majority are elderly people over the age of 75 with pre-existing conditions i.e. nursing home patients.Having said that, it is absurd that we are still in lockdown and debating weather kids should be back in school. It is 100% political now and has been for months. Keep the kids out of school ..parents can't go back to work ..simple. Instead of keeping all the kids out of school, protect the elderly teachers. Tbis is a no brainer but the Democrats thrive on weak minds which is why they spend 24/7 spreading panic and fear. They constantly speak of rising cases but they never mention lower hospitalizations.If you have any question regarding this, just look at what the Democrats are now pushing regarding mail in voting now.So let me get this straight... thousands of people can wear masks (which don't work to prevent you from contracting this virus, as the virus is in a size range of .02 µm and any cloth mask would not stop anything smaller than .3 µm, which is the size of a basic bacteria.)... and these same thousands of individuals go shopping every day at Walmart, Kroger's, Food Lion, Harris Teeter, HD, Lowes or wherever and stand in long lines...but yet these same people apparently can't stand in a line to cast their vote at any number of accessible voting locations. This is an amazing virus.. it apparently only affects you if you're standing in line to vote. Humm You literally have thousands of people standing hand-in-hand rioting and protesting saying they are NOT going to vote in person but yet no news shows the obvious that they're standing hand-in-hand at the time they're protesting ......WAKE UP AMERICA..this type of insanity from the radical left makes you want to just bang your head against the wall when you consider the incredible stupidity of their positions.NCLH along with dozens of other cruise companies are trying desperately to get their companies back online, but many are still at the mercy of the corrupt CDC and the millions of sheep in this world who can't seem to understand common sense.I have been deeply invested in NCLH and will remain so as this company will not only survive but THRIVE in short order and definitely after this election.Therapeutics are coming in left and right but never in the history of this country has there been such insanity surrounding a single virus than with Covid. I'm not going to get into it on this post but just follow the money with regard to Dr. Fauci and Birx ...they have been on Gates payroll for over a decade. All those original charts that Fauci and Birx were showing, which have been proven to be way off in their death estimations, were all produced by the Gates foundation.It's all about money people ...it always has been. Why use hydroxychloroquine for a single dollar per dose when they can make thousands off a single treatment of Remdesivir or some other vaccine under Gates control.And yes.. hydroxychloroquin along with zinc, absolutely works in the early stages of contracting Covid and would have saved thousands of lives had the FDA not been pressured by the Gates foundation and Soros and other deep state donors. NCLH... I believe has found a new bottom in the $15 range... especially as other countries are moving forward with their cruise plans. Is this a volatile stock ??absolutely. But as big tech money begins to move away from groups like Tesla and Amazon and Google ...these funds will slowly begin to move in to the sectors that have been beat down the most...ie the hospitality sector and cruising.

This adds up to more than 2 years of liquidity without revenue, so even if the no sail order extends all the way to the end of 2021, NCLH will have enough liquidity to not operate a single cruise. I highly doubt the industry to recover to its normal level of customer and revenue in the upcoming 2 years, but it will eventually recover to its normal level. I am certain that NCLH share price will drop further, probably even below $10 if more bad news were to come, but the room for a rebound will be much higher than the amount it dropped. I am not bullish on the stock, I am more bearish, but the fact that NCLH still has 2 years worth of liquidity really makes me wonder if such high volatility is necessary.

By leaving the excursion, the family violated MSC's new rule that requires passengers only leave the ship on group tours organized and sold through MSC.The line said that by leaving the excursion the family ""broke the bubble,"" putting other passengers at risk.The cruise wrapped up without other major incident, and MSC declared the sailing a success and said its protocols were effective. By way of example, it said that a passenger had tested positive at embarkation and, as a result, he and his traveling party, and other passengers who had traveled in the van with him to the pier, were all denied boarding.As far as travel advisors are concerned, the way MSC handled the violation was not only the absolute right way to do it but the only way to ensure a successful industry restart.Good for them...",0.9815
2093,"Over the last two weekends I have written posts that surmised that NCL was under a stealth accumulation and that we were in a trading pattern between 15.10 and 17.00. The key to the 15.10 trading range was that we not close below that level though we might trade below that level during the day. Finally, I guessed that we were seeing the beginning of the bottoming process as we prepare for a major move up.This week brought confirmation that the process I predicted is underway.Here are the lows for NCL for Monday-Thursday of the past week. Mon. 15.04, Tuesday 15.05, Wednesday 15.06 and Thursday 15.08. Note two things in the pattern. First, we didn't trade in the 14's this week and second you see a trend of rising lows on the week. This shows a subtle, though visible accumulation process on the part of investors. The high for the week was 16.37 so we remain firmly in the 15.10-17.00 trading range which is fine for now.There was also confirmation of an accumulation process from another source, a negative article on NCL written by FX Trader. The gist of his article was that all three cruise lines will burn through their credit facilities and go BK. But at the the end of the article he admitted that the AD line showed massive accumulation in NCL at the 15.00 level. What is the AD line. It stands for acquisition and distribution and measures how many shares are acquired at the ask vs at the bid. If people are acquiring more at the ask than those selling at the bid then a stock is under acquisition which is good. NCL is under acquisition.FX trader explained the acquisition away by saying it was probably short covering and buying by speculators who will lose all there money.Everyone is entitled to their opinion. I happen to be one of those speculators so feel free to come and join me if you so desire. Finally, let me repeat bottoming is a process and I expect this process to take another 3-4 weeks before we move up to the next trading range.Have a good week and enjoy the process.",0.9959

2096,"The market appears to be pricing in a potential severe liquidity crisis for NCLH. The price is $12 (while typing this) and that is around 40% of book value. I cannot rule anything out, but it's worth a discussion.First the potential negatives:The balance sheet shows 1.4 billion in Goodwill assets and 827 million in intangible assets . Those are numbers that you (typically) cannot take to the bank as collateral to procure a loan. I consider them mostly accounting concepts. There is typically some value in goodwill and intangible assets but they are the opposite of hard assets.So, if you remove Goodwill, intangible assets, and apply liabilities against assets you are left with about 4.5 billion for the shareholders. Debt is high relative to equity and reflects poor planning (in my opinion), but it is not at a level where I would immediately apply a going concern status. I can only speak as someone viewing the existing 2019 balance sheet.I also understand that at least some adversity results from the poor PR on the part of NCL regarding leaked e-mails on the covid-19 virus. That has to be at least part of the reason for the negativity.Now the good:Unless there are more off the balance sheet issues and because of the status of securing a 675 million credit line, most of my colleagues would not jump on the insolvency band wagon.NCL has assets that they can sell or use as collateral. I would need to be surprised by an off balance sheet revelation for me to believe that they will have an issue staying in business over the next year. The lawsuit that has garnered attention in the media (based on those leaked e-mails) is one factor that is a variable I suppose.My current posture is that $12 is like someone at a garage sale selling you their son's original star wars card collection for $12.

2159,"Here's the bull case:A little annoyed this is crashing short term.Keeping in mind that:1) Banks already providing loans are going to help.(Banks do not want to acquire a boat on a fire sale/foreclosure that not one will buy or will be a hassle to sell and is a nightmare to even practically attempt to do. Both bank and cruise co's win if banks are helpful, since being gracious to cruise companies will benefit the lending bank-long term with continued revenue from interest from NCLH. Thus, we should expect banks to co-operate with cruises, which is good for NCLH.Technically, also, NCLH debt is much smaller and our revenue-to-debt ratios are smaller than CCL and RCL. So, NCLH is relatively in a decent position for upside once coronavirus fears subside.)2) Fundamentally safe, panic selling is a foot and will eventually correct itself.(Technically, there is no fundamental reason why cruise ships should be a place that is higher-risk for having customers bringing in coronavirus to the effect of infecting others on the ship based on the nature of the cruise operations other than those cruises that sail to countries with higher-risk of contracting coronavirus. A good plan to increase safety and security against coronavirus, discussed below, will also make cruises even more attractive.)3) development of a contingency plan to save stock price and revenues moving forward and create added value for the future in terms of the reputation of safety for cruises(Yes, if, perhaps, a customer comes from those other countries, there may be a problem. But, if American cruises take the right percautions and react smartly and quickly, cruiseline stocks should be able to bounce back strong with revenue with, perhaps, a minor adjustment in costs that were incurred to create a safe experience for cruise-goers who board their ships. A good precautionary strategy and protocol should simply be implemented. For example, certain cruises to ""risky countries"" (China, for example) should be postponed until the pandemic dissipates. Then, management should have/hire nurses with appropriate PPE (masks, NIOSH n95 or even p100's) on board, get trained using a non-contact IR thermometer, perhaps, invest in rapid-detection test kits, have questionnaires that inquire about recent travels to at-risk countries, create a protocol that allows trained and employed nurses/staff tests people before boarding ship, have HVAC system with UV and HEPA (kills and traps coronavirus) on the ship (buy portable air purifiers for each room if central HVAC installations/renos are too expensive). Discuss this with a consultant and try to release an IR on the strateggic safety measures designed and implemented to encourage investors and customers. From a costs-benefits perspective, say if this increased costs by 1% (say 1 million USD), its much better than a reduction in revenue greater than 10% and the resultant drop of our share price. Dear management: Talk to a consultant and don't just wait this out.)4) Demand is still here. (We have a large aging population with many retirees and people ready to retire. Instagram culture promotes tourism because people like taking pictures of them on fancy tours, trips, and cruises. There's definetly demand, young and old. Also, COVID-19 isn't permanent, so reductions in demand will not be permanent. Diseases, even at the pandemic and epidemic level will come and go. When the vaccine is released, just like polio being eradicated, this disease too will be history, just like SARS in 2002. Demand is still here, though perhaps delayed.)Maybe these reasons are part of why Warren Buffet is also bullish long-term on cruises.",0.9993

You can check the numbers yourself at https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput.My opinion: the general public is feeling more confident with airline safety protocols. The same will happen with cruise line safety protocols, as well as many other businesses. That will translate to increasing (not decreasing) pressure on the CDC to back off.

I'm optimistic that cruising will restart in the near term and that NCLH, CCL, and RCL are excellent investment opportunities. My favorite is, of course, Norwegian. Further out, who knows?

The latest WHO report says that the virus can last up to 17 days in a cruise ship cabin. That is not good news and tells me that they won't be sailing until there is a vaccine or treatment that lowers the risk. People can tolerate risk, but they won't risk being a ship that can get quarantined and have no port to dock at. So this will be a news driven stock and when the islands all decide that paying customers are more important than the Corona virus, then the sailings will begin again.

2300,"On each of the last two Saturdays I have told you that NCL was in a trading range between 15.10 and 17.00 and there was stealth accumulation of the stock in the low 15's. I told you that we would see a breakout to the upside that would reset set the trading range. That happened on Friday as we closed outside the old trading range. I believe the new trading range will be between 16.40 and 19.00 and that ultimately the stock will hit a high of 30-32 before we get a sizeable pullback.But let me again caution you as I have each week. This move up is a process that is going to happen over the next month or two. The stock moves on vaccine news and will ultimately have its major move when the CDC acts to lift the no sail order. None of us controls the news so I urge you to remain optimistic but cautious.On that note I want to offer some thoughts about the market in general. The S&P set several new records this week and was up 111 points or 3.3% for the week. The DOW was up 724 points or 2.6% for the week. The S&P is up seven straight days. Unfortunately, I do not believe these moves are sustainable in the short term. I see overhead resistance in the S&P at about 3573 which could lead to a 10% correction during the first two weeks of September. I don't mind being wrong in this prediction. NCL would be hit by the sell off but should hold just slightly below my 16.40 trading range. If we get this sell off and you have some extra funds, this would be the time to commit them.I will leave the shorts to decide where they want to cover but I would suggest that Friday's breakout should have you thinking about your strategy. Let me reiterate that I am a speculator in the stock. The accumulation/dispersion line predicted this breakout and was positive on Friday. That means there is more upside to come in the future so if we get this downdraft just look beyond it.",0.9949

Anyone that has been on a Norwegian cruise knows the quality of both the experience and the company. I know that these times are difficult and we could see $4 but what we are witnessing right now is not a reflection of the economy, like it was in 2008. This scenario is driven almost entirely by the pandemic. Which means, the recovery period in general should be shorter than in 2008, and we all know where the market went starting in mid-2009 right?

I've never tasted worst food especially the steaks and beef dishes and the poor service for anything that I needed and mind you I rarely ask for anything. One instance where my son needed water to take some aspirin because he had a headache, they insisted that I purchase water. The itinerary and the shows were pretty good though however after being on 10+ cruises with Carnival which I immensely enjoyed every one of them, Carnival is just so much better and much less costly. However after the second time I said never again. I wrote the company and told them about the issues that I had and they just told me sorry and that's it. They could have offered a free cruise and I wouldn't have taken it. The fact that they have to declare bankruptcy doesn't surprise me. One example is that on Carnival I see the crew cleaning the elevators all day long every time I hop on and off. On Norwegian , they clean them only late at night. This is probably why so many Norwegian ships end up with norovirus. Anyway I would stay away from this stock for these reasons. I was never impressed with their ships or service.",0.9836

Having said that, you do have a massive amount of bash posts here and since you claim that Robin Hood is the majority of the people on here, which I have no reason to doubt that ...you believe that these young minds can be easily influenced which I believe is why you post the way you do. Prior you were the eternal optimist.Now you are actually going as far as pushing the Chapter 11 possibility... which you know will not happen unless there's no sailing for over a year and a half ...and that's simply absurd because this country will collapse under that guidance. As soon as this election is behind us many things will change very quickly as all of this doom and gloom is directed towards November 3. And the reason the left wants mail in voting is so that they can prolong the results as long as possible ....it easy to see what they're doing.Intelligent people on this board do not need to hear that negative info constantly. We are aware of the risks and we have all done our due diligence (at least I hope so), so we're also aware of the plight that the US economy is in but we are also aware that the market is always forward-looking ...so the constant bashing is not necessary. Some here claim that I'm too much of an optimist but I beg to differ... I'm simply trying to let people know that there is a future here and that this stock will make a lot of people very wealthy.Bickering over shares at 13 or 12.50 or 13.80 is not something that will be of great concern when this goes to 40. It's also why I said anything under 14 is a good buy.Buying and selling daily on this is up to each of you but people will be chasing this in short order the closer we get to the election.I have made a great deal of money in my lifetime but the events that stand out most in my life are all the memories and thoughts of when I help people. Which is why I enjoy being an optimist, and it has always served me well.CNN and MSNBC refused to ever report anything positive for the United States all for their lust for power. Wouldn't even air Trump's statements yesterday when he signed the 4 executive orders ...going over the Democrats heads on several key points to help the economy.Pelosi refuses to agree to anything unless she gets a carte blanche agreement for 'mail in voting' which is a recipe for fraud and dishonesty. How people still follow these news outlets is beyond me.From time to time I have posted a few symbols for others to look up to judge for themselves. I do not like to throw a bunch of companies out there like some dartboard. It's why I only share those that first and foremost I am personality invested in and have been watching for a while.Having said that, I remain heavily invested in NCLH. Its just a matter of time when sailing resumes. That may sound oversimplified but the market is always forward looking. As herd immunity takes over and people finally begin to realize we're not all going to die, despite the lefts constant doom and gloom campaigns to keep America shutdown ....public sentiment WILL shift to getting back to work. This current election has been pure hell on this country as there is such a huge divide between those who are sick and tired of hearing we're all bad people, we're all going to die, our history is insignificant and you can't go outside or put your kids in school....Crazy.The Democrats are purposely holding this country back for the upcoming election. They manipulate the weak minds.Keeping people apart from each other is not going to make covid disappear... 99% of people have little to no issue with it.Just look South Dakota and the success they have and they've NEVER closed down.In the meantime I shared a few pics over the last few weeks that I believe will perform relatively well outside of NCLH.I shared on July 31st, WKHS when it was in it's $15 range and I mentioned it again August 3rd....before they jumped the nearly $20. Yes it has settled back down in the $15 range but I believe it will still grow.ACER is another I shared that same day, when it was in the $3 dollar range and now its heading up closer to $6. I also gave the heads up for KODK before their run up which if played properly made some wealthy.I mentioned COOP last Monday the 3rd, when they were still $16 range and they jumped to near $19. I also shared last Tuesday August 4th. SRNE. At that time you could have bought in $9-$10 range.

I think the pressure on the CDC has mounted as the cruise lines presented realistic though incomplete protocols. I ascribe the delay in the announcement to mean that both sides are working feverishly to reach an agreement this weekend. The upshot of the work will be the ban is extended for 30 days but limited cruising will begin in November from US ports. My view is bolstered by a little noticed report issued by the Federal Maritime Commission on Friday that noted the economic damage done to Florida businesses and workers due to the ban and suggested that the ban be lifted as soon as possible to prevent further damage.I was correct that the sell off in the market had further to go. On Thursday we got as low as 3209 on the S&P and entered CORRECTION territory. We hit a high of 3588 on Sept 2 and by Thur. we were 379 points lower. A correction is defined as a 10% down and the 10.7% move down met that criteria. I also think the correction is now over and that over the next four or five weeks we will have a choppy rally back NEAR the all time high. I saw Thursday as a battle between the bulls and bears as the DOW moved 750 points as both sides battled for control of the market. Bulls won for now and Friday's price action confirmed my thoughts. Beyond four to five weeks, we are facing a bigger sell off than we just experienced but we will leave that to a future post.As far as NCL, the market makers used the market weakness to run some more stops taking out the stops at 15.50, 15.00 and 14.50. They wound up with all those shares but the stock was in a technically weak position. Then out of the clear blue along came Barclays and the technically weak position changed to technically strong as we finished at the high of the day. Do you believe in miracles? Sorry, I don't but I will take it since I'm long.We are back on track for as 30-32 price target in the next few weeks thanks to that perfectly timed upgrade.Did you know we were up for the week? We closed the previous week at 16.25.Anyway, here is the perfect script. We rally on Monday on the secondary effect of the upgrade and let's say tack on a buck to close in the high 17's. Tuesday morning we get the ban lifted as I outlined and we trade 40m shares in the first hour and the stock closes up 20% for the day.Due to technical reasons the shorts will cover in the 20.50--21.00 area. The market rally will help us as well as the capitulation of the shorts as new higher price levels are reached. 27.00 will be a problem and it may turn into a top. If we get through that then 30-32 is DEFINITELY an intermediate top. You will need to make a decision at 27 or 30. If you are interested why, read part 2.Anyway, this looks like some fantasy by some crazy long. Got it. Here is the deal. The Barclays upgrade came out of left field and changed the whole feel of the stock. The PT is 26 and the MM just loaded up on low priced shares and they closed the stock at the HOD.Hollywood script. I will go with it.Part 2 coming up. People have asked me to explain some of the mathematical formulas I use. I will do so in Part 2.

I've even cruise the Paul Gaugin (Regent) in Tahiti. The only time any cruise line stole from me was the one time I cruised with Norwegian. After leaving 2 dive bags outside my cabin in San Juan, Puerto Rico the last evening of the cruise, the next morning we disembarked to find all of our luggage in the designated area except for the two dive bags. All I could do was file a missing luggage report before catching the shuttle to the airport to catch our flight home. NCLH has thieves working on their ship. Fortunately, my accountant told me the loss might be covered by my homeowners insurance and it was, so I basically got all new equipment back. The dive shop was glad to issue me receipts for all my past purchases. Now with these short sales I'm way ahead of that theft.

Granted these are unusual times to say the least but having said that you need to see the bigger picture here.... this virus is 'short term' relatively speaking....cruise companies are LONG term.Two weeks ago many here were freaking out over 12 or 10 now it's 16 to 18.

I doubt Key West would affect the cruise ship industry in the slightest. The long term locals believe the ships block Mallory Square view of the ocean as ships come and go constantly and have been using covid as a driving force for their measures.....but many local small business owners have become reliant on the Cruise Ship income stream that the constant stream of passengers provide them....not to mention the city has drawn in millions as a result of cruise ships docking at their smaller ports just from basic disembarkation fees from each person leaving the ship.Using Covid at this time is just another tool many are trying to use to alter business as usual. The truth is the island is only so big so it can only handle so much of a population walking around daily before it becomes a burden on the area.....so limiting the number of passengers that disembark each day may not be such a bad idea to preserve the area for future stopovers. I believe a compromise could be reached at this particular port where a limited number of passengers would be able to sign up to disembark (not Covid related) but in terms of preserving the area.I've been to Key West to chill and dive many times and it is not that big. Hangouts like the Green Room can only hold so many people.Hang on folks....Cruising WILL continue soon and the future of cruising will forever be cemented as a great value and experience for decades to come.",0.9773

By April 1, the company had raised almost $6 billion in bond markets, paying rates far below those executives had discussed just days earlier.The previously unreported tale of Carnival’s rescue shows how effective the Fed has been in turning the debt spigot back on for large corporations. The idea of a cruise company raising so much new debt even as the pandemic worsened caught many by surprise. Nevertheless, fear of missing out attracted more investors. When Carnival officially sold a $4 billion bond on April 1, it had enough demand to cut the interest rate down to 11.5% and issue a $1.75 billion bond that could convert into stock.",0.8642

2811,"This is Part 2 of week 7.Let me begin with an observation. I am going to explain one of the formulas I use. You may read the explanation and conclude that is a bunch of #$%$ That is fine with me. I'm here to explain what I USE, not to tell you WHAT SYSTEM YOU SHOULD USE.If you noticed I actually predict three separate items. First, I predict the trading ranges for the stock, second the intermediate term move of the stock and third a prediction of the overall market based on the S&P. There are three different sets of mathematical calculations AND some technical analysis that is involved because there are three different factors.Today, I am only going to deal with the intermediate calculation of NCL's price so do not confuse this with what I use for the other two areas.To compute where I think NCL's price is headed I use a combination of Elliott Wave analysis and Fibonachi principles. The analysis of these two models leads to the same conclusion (which doesn't always happen). The maximum top is 30-32 but THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE WE WILL HIT THE TOP Of THE RANGE.I am not a believer in Elliott Wave and consider much of it utter #$%$ But there are two things that I do subscribe to. First that the market and stocks move in five waves in the primary direction followed by three waves in the opposite direction and secondly that wave five can never be longer than wave three. Throw out everything else.Right now NCL's primary direction is UP so we are going to have five waves up before we get a direction change. But what wave are we in? Let's find out by counting the waves.NCL changed direction when it hit bottom on March 18. The bottom was 7.03 and the first wave higher ended on March 26 when we hit 20.28. Note the number.The second wave began on April 2 with a low of 8.08 and ended on April 30 with a high of 17.48. Note that the low was higher than the previous low.Wave 3 began on May 14 at 9.24 and ended June 8 at 26.91. Again we had a higher low than wave 2 and that the total move was $17.67.Wave 4 began on Aug 3 at $12.56 and ended at 19.20 on Sept.3 at $19.20 Again note the low was higher than the previous low.Finally, I believe that the fifth wave began September 24 with a low of 14.15 with a top yet to be determined. Now let's follow the rule that the fifth wave can't be longer than the third wave. If I add 17.67 to 14.15 I get 31.82. That means the stock won't trade higher than that number but could fall into the 30-32 window that I gave to you weeks ago.Black magic, I know, but the good thing is you get to play along in real time and see how I do. None of this after the fact I told you so junk.Okay, so why might this be important to you? First EW is predicting that this is an intermediate top which means you won't see it again for months. Second, the factors I use to predict the market are calling for a large correction in the Nov.-Dec. time range. Nothing original there. Plenty of people are predicting a sell off. My only contribution to the conversation is that I'm predicting a bigger sell off than most.So what is the purpose of this discussion. You always have a decision to make in the market. Buy, sell or hold. My analysis is that in a few weeks you will have an important decision to make with respect to the stock. I offer you NO ADVICE. DON'T ASK FOR ANY.There is no right or wrong answer since every investor is different with different goals and risk tolerance. I simply offer you my analysis to do with it as you choose.",0.7469

2947,"got this from our Great Senator Lankford/Oklahomathere are in fact some congressmen who have a decent head on their shoulders and care about our CountryThank you for contacting me about the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Conditional Sailing Order for American cruise lines. I appreciate the opportunity to hear from you.As you know, in March 2020 the CDC implemented a No Sail order for cruise ships operating in U.S. waters. This order was extended in April, July, and September, 2020. The CDC eventually issued a less- restrictive framework, the ""Conditional Sailing Order,"" in October 2020 and recently updated this order with a new phase of the framework on April 2, 2021, which provided guidance on a phased approach to resume cruises. Some of the guidance includes establishing laboratory testing for crew members and simulated voyages that will test the cruise line's ability to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. For more information on the new guidance I encourage you to visit the CDC website . I understand your concern that the cruise industry has been left behind due to these restrictions while other industries are consistently reopening. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted nearly every aspect of the American economy, but the cruise line industry has been among the hardest hit. There have been several efforts in Congress to stop the CDC from continuing these restrictions such as the introduction of the Careful Resumption Under Improved Safety Enhancements (CRUISE) Act by Senators Marco Rubio (FL), Rick Scott (FL), and Dan Sullivan (AK), whose states are obviously heavily impacted by cruise-related travel and tourism. Specifically, the CRUISE Act would require the CDC to revoke the Conditional Sailing Order and provide cruise lines with guidance on how to safely resume domestic operations by July 4, 2021. The CRUISE Act currently awaits further consideration, but I will continue to monitor the legislation and keep your thoughts in mind going forward.",0.998

Look at all the additional, high-interest, debt the companies have taken on to survive. Look at the amount of dilution has occurred. Look at how much their margins will drop due to lower occupancies on each cruise. Look at the risk of exposure lawsuits.

I have not posted recently because I've been caring for my mother who had her neck broken by a drunk driver and she's now under hospice care here at my home. Very sad. It's difficult to watch your loved ones die in front of you.Having said that,..it annoys me to see so many young people bash and try to derail what they do not understand. I have stated from when I began posting here (feel free to tap on SilentBull and read my past posts), that herd immunity is the path out of this mess. We are nearing this threshold very quickly. Widespread Therapeutic means to combat Covid are just around the corner, regardless if a vaccine is developed.Keeping people locked down has been the wrong approach for 99% of America.Keeping kids out of school is PURELY political. It is simply to keep the parents out of work to keep the economy down. Kids have practically no issue with covid. This is knowledge supported across the globe. Only 14 kids under 15 years old have died in all of America. Any death is sad but COME ON.... Keep all kids out of school over that? I've posted the pertinent percentages sever times regarding the incredible low risk covid presents to this Country. If you're under 70 years old your chances of having any serious issue with Covid are .04%.THIS ENTIRE LOCKDOWN IS POLITICAL NOW and has been for months. The elderly are the most vulnerable (we have known this for months now) which is why we CAN reopen this country and just protect the vulnerable ....you don't shut an entire country down because of less than 1% mortality rate. This is a political circus and anybody who doesn't understand this has your head in the sand.And if the virus is so deadly, why hasn't it wiped out the homeless who don't social distance or wash themselves regularly and live in a complete unsanitary environment.?The real virus in this Country is the media. If someone were to eliminate CNN ..MSNBC and several other leftist networks, and even some of the folks on Fox, this Country would already be back open. In 2018, 1.5 million people died of tuberculosis ...so why weren't people wearing masks during that pandemic?? I'll tell you why, because the main stream media wasn't telling people to wear a mask. Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection which is spread specifically from person to person, just like covid, by being airborne. (We already know Covid doesn't exist long on surfaces).And as 1.5 million people died of tuberculosis, there was ZERO mention of a pandemic ... Because it wasn't a pandemic, no more than there is a Covid pandemic.The vast majority of people have to be tested to even know if they have Covid ....explain to me how that is a pandemic.This crisis has blown fullbore into a political message to try to defeat President Trump ....There is zero reason to keep this country locked down and you are no more going to stop this virus by wearing a face mask then you are going to put up a chain-link fence to try to keep mosquitoes out of your yard ...NCLH will be fine. They are simply posturing themselves to get through this election cycle.Every day at CNN and MSNBC its nothing but...RISING CASES.... No mention of deaths drastically down. They say hospitals are overwhelmed but they don't mention it's because people are returning for elective surgery etc. They mention all these covid cases but don't mention the incredible problem of states triple counting a single persons addition tests as a NEW case.They mention deaths but they don't mention 75% of those are nursing home fatalities. They do this on purpose because they want each of you to think you are all going to die. And the sad part is that so many people are so mentally challenged that they actually believe it.They demand schools be closed unless police are defunded...say what??They keep all the kids, who have no issue with Covid, out of school instead of keeping the more elderly teachers at home. Its completely backwards thinking.This is so sad that the left will try to ruin America in order to gain power.They know they are loosing so they have crippled America by politicizing Covid and then fueled the fear with riots, destruction and general unrest. Then decided to defund the police to further allow more killing and fear. Now somehow mount Rushmore ...when all other past presidents praised it...is somehow a symbol of white supremacy only when Donald Trump speaks at the base of the mountain. HummmThey throw gas on the flames every damn day..NONSTOP.Pelosi calling Federal officers 'Stormtroopers' as Trump simply wants to stop the violence.

The rally on Thursday interrupted a continuing downtrend in the market that started after the April recovery high of 2955 on the S&P. I expect the sell off to continue beginning late next week or early the following week. You should look for a target of 2650 on the S&P which happens to be a 38.2% retracement of the 763 point rally off the 2192 March low in the S&P. What this means is that we are likely to see another trip down into the 9's. You might want to get mentally prepared for it.Now the good news. The CDC announced the no sale rule on April 15 and it expires on July 25. Carnival is set to sail on Aug 1. But the CDC can't wait until July 25 to make its decision. The logistics of getting a ship ready to sail on means they will have to make a decision around July 1, give or take a week. I suspect the order will be lifted. Look for 17-18 on a rally,",0.7297

NCLH does not need to do another equity raise. However, they raised that cash through exchangeable notes, and those notes will double the shares outstanding pre covid.

3168,"Here's an interesting tidbit to consider. Both Princess and Holland American have cancelled ALL cruises to Alaska this season along with cancelling all openings of corporation owned lodges. Norwegian has only cancelled for next 100 days and has not called off the entire summer season into Alaska. This may prove beneficial as the season generally runs into late September and even early October so they could capitalize on the latter half of the cruise season.Alaska Governor Dunleavy has relaxed some social lock down as of April 24th with soft openings along the way every 2 weeks. Should this prove to be adequate, Alaska tourism industry may figure out a way to initiate a partial tourist season late July through early October. This was not expected so other cruise lines just cancelled the season. Very short sighted. Alaska, by the way, currently has the LOWEST number of confirmed Covid cases of all U.S. states. Hmm...All this is interesting and possibly indicates a move toward cruise activation but hinges on several things. First, the CDC would need to approve cruise ships operating in and out of the U.S. again. Second, Canada would need to allow ships into port again prior to said ships venturing into Alaska. Check the Jones Act if you are unclear on this. Third, Alaska Governor Dunleavy would need to life interstate restrictions of travelers. All this could unfold, especially if Alaska sees no increase in cases as restrictions are lifted more and more every 2 weeks. Most likely not going to happen this summer but I find the lack of NCL in cancelling the entire Alaska cruise season compelling. We shall see.",0.9803

3175,"The lack of consistency in the CDC is appalling.They recently came out and were speaking about Covid being spread in relation to aerosols. Then they retracted it because they were clearly trying to overreach and spread even MORE fear to the public with regard to the transmission of Covid. People, if the CDC had it their way, this entire country would stay locked down permanently and that's exactly what Dr. Fauci's views are. Remember his comments ???..""we can never shake hands again""... blah blah blahSo the CDC backtracked yet again and fell back on the droplet theory. Which is the whole premise behind the masks.The theory is that people are not wearing masks for any other reason than not to SPREAD Covid.... that was the original intent.. In other words, if you already HAD Covid and you coughed, the mask will help prevent infected droplets from going forward. The problem with this theory is that the extreme minute size of Covid allows it to pass directly through masks and there are multiple tests showing that even when a person wears a mask people around them still get infected. Covid is in the size range of .04 �m and even the N 95 mask as I stated before only stops larger bacteria in the range of .3 �m..People are under the impression that if you wear a mask it is somehow preventing you from getting Covid. The masks DO NOT prevent you from getting Covid.Which is why the comments from the head of the CDC were so outrageous saying that the masks were a better prevention from Covid than a vaccine.And of course he had to walk that back.As I stated earlier, if you have a mask on and you pass by somebody who is smoking a cigarette or wearing perfume and you can smell this odor, then you are also breathing in the Covid-19 virus.The CDC apparently thinks the entire world is currently infected. The masks only help an INFECTED person to not spread it through sputum, but not through other means of transmission of Covid ..which are many. Including the fact that Covid itself passes directly through these cloth masks. it's only the particles trapped in sputum that is slowed down by a mask. But even then as you mess with your mask on your face with your hands then you take it off ..put it on ..take it off ...put it on ..you're just as easily spreading it through the sputum if you are an infected person. #$%$ up.The UCLA and Stanford COVID-19 study, which is where much of the CDC's information comes from, clearly states the following:1. chances of contracting Covid is 1 in 3,8362. Chances of being hospitalized because of Covid is 1 in 852,0003. Chances of dying for AT RISK patients is 1 in 19.1 million.... did you get that ???? ONE FATALITY 19.1 million!!! It went on to say .....""that after all that we have learned we now the virus is 10 times LESS FATAL than what we first thought. The vast majority of those who catch Covid will have mild to no symptoms. Children are largely spared.""....But the CDC didn't like this information out there, so they suppressed it ....because they WANT to keep fear and panic in America.Those of you who want to keep politics off this board are clueless to the fact that politics are EXTREMELY pertinent to this board because NCLH will NOT cruise again until the CDC stops throwing fear and panic out there.ALL the original graphs that were shown to America were PROVEN to be so far off..and they were ALL from Dr. Fauci and Gates foundation. Their intent from the beginning was no one can leave your home.. no one can shake anyone's hand ..no one can say hi to their neighbor unless you're across the yard ..UNTIL a vaccine is developed!But you can go out and riot ..burn cities down...have multiple ceremonies at churches for Floyd ...stand arm in arm and riot up and down streets across America...cause chaos and destruction ..which by the way ALL came from the left. Not ONE riot ..not ONE fire ..not ONE destructive display was caused by a republican group or member. These are simple facts.And if you don't think you can vote in person you are just pandering to the left-wing nonsense...as millions of Americans go to Walmart, Lowes, etc. etc. every single day. If you're in a situation where you physically cannot go vote, like in my mother's situation, as she is now a quadriplegic thanks to a drunk driver,.. you simply can request an 'absentee ballot' which is secure and is what I did for her.. and I have already mailed it in. This is a far different thing than 'mass mail in' unsolicited, voting ballots.... but the left wants to pretend they are one in the same.

Very sad all the looting and destruction by ignorant people.Yes, covid cases rise as testing rises but the news fails to report that deaths are down. NCLH is a strong company and they WILL recover. I didn't sell any positions today as I was doing my best to help my mother. But I doubt I would have anyway. If you are out of powder, watching days like today are difficult. If you do happen to have extra funds, its a good buying opportunity. These prices are reasonable given all the panic. You wouldn't see nearly this level of panic if this were not an election year.

The trips will operate with a robust health and safety program including mandatory vaccinations for all guests and crew and universal COVID-19 testing, the cruise operator said.Royal Caribbean Group will also resume sailing some of its cruises from the Caribbean in June with vaccinated adult guests.

3281,First of all.....I don’t own any shares as I have only been following this stock before I jump in. Cash burn is $190 million per month. They need to raise some cash very fast with a vote expected May 20th of issuance of more shares which we all know will diluted the share price. Guidance has already been forecasted ending June 30th as a loss with no revenue. Let’s not forget a possible chapter 11 as they have $3.5 billion cash on hand with a loaf of debt around $12 billion. Here is my opinion.....1. The vote will pass May 20th to issue more shares. Thus diluting the current share price. 2. Perfect time for them to file chapter 11 restructuring their debt to get a fresh start outta the gate before they do start sailing. 3. Current share holders are the ones to lose and Norwegian gains momentum before sailing again.4. It’s written all over the white board in the board room “Let’s do this right as we now have a fresh start”I would like to hear otherwise if you disagree with my thought process.

3305,"Last week I wrote two posts. The first one basically said the early week move in the stock was NOT the move to $30.00 that many of you hoped for but there was a stealth accumulation going on that would provide the impetus for a big move up in 5-6 weeks. The second post made the same point but said we would see a new trading range from 15.10 to 17.00.Let's see what happened. The stock market analysts said we saw the first signs of an overall rotation from the momentum stocks to value stocks. This is code words for a rotation from the FANGS to stocks that have been left behind in the rally. Notice I am not talking specifically about NCLH. The coming move will encompass all the leisure and hotel stocks and we have no way of knowing whether NCLH will be the best gainer or near the bottom. The only thing we know is that a sizeable move to the upside is coming in the September-October time frame.The other thing that you should notice is that NCLH stayed within my 15.10-17.00 trading range. I should have been clearer and added the words on a closing basis. While we did see the stock trade as low as 14.75 after my post it ALWAYS closed above the 15.10 level that I said was crucial. Friday's low volume ramp to 15.75 on only 24M shares is just another sign that accumulation is underway. Don't be discouraged by the barrage of negative analyst's recommendations that are appearing about the cruise lines stocks. They are actually a contra indicator of what will be happening in the future. These usually appear before a move in the opposite direction and are used to force sell offs where the accumulators pick up some more cheap shares.Let me review the analysts calls over the past eight days. Wedbush cut NCLH from 26 to 20 but kept its out perform on the stock. This is a good one. Morgan Stanley kept its under perform on CCL and cut its price target from 11 to 10. Yep, a whole report to cut your target by a dollar. Over at RCL, Deutsche Bank cut its price target from 43 to 37 and Credit Suisse cut its price target by $3.00.Everyone hates the cruise lines these days. But you know what is interesting. Even though we saw negative recommendations all the cruise lines were up this week and the Sept 18 $20.00 option traded 3,000 to 5,000 contracts a day.The stocks are going to be buffeted when there is a liquidity injection. RCL got a new billion dollar revolver last week and CCL issued a new 900M bond on FRI. These actions will keep knocking the stocks down but they have to survive and that includes dilution for us. Try to remember that when NCLH moves it will be based on emotion and not because some sat down and calculated the amount of dilution.The key number remains $15.10. As long as we continue to close above it and the stealth accumulation goes on, we should see some sizeable gains in the time frame I outlined above.",0.9987

The CDC will push the no sail date until at least until September 1. I believe CDC will add another a minimum of 60 days past July 24. My guess would be October 1. So your most profitable months those being the summer are completely wiped out. These companies are hemorrhaging cash with no end in sight.

3367,"I thought a comparison between NCL and CCL is a worthwhile discussion. First, a look at CCL:CCL:Book value -CCL has a book value of $37 as of their latest published balance sheet of November 2019. This is not reflective of CCL being behind in their delivery of financials. Their fiscal year ends on November. Overall, CCL has a discount to their book value. The stock currently is priced at $23 in comparison to the $37 book value. This is a .62 price to book value. Cash -On this balance sheet CCL has 508m in cash and 1,827m in short term debt. In other words, .5b cash level is what is available to service 1.8b this year. The current ratio is .23. It bears repeating that this reflects the very low end of the business cycle. Cash swells when the season is in full swing. Of course, no one expects cash to swell significantly during the current crisis. Short-term credit -On their access to short-term credit, I have searched the internet and cannot find their short-term credit line access status. That does not mean it does not exist. I just cannot pull this up in my research. Long-term debit -CCL's debt to equity ratio which reflects a long-term balance sheet perspective of .38. This is not considered excessive. In fact, compared to peers, it is considered moderately positive.NCLH:Book value -In comparison to NCL, we are looking at a November versus December financial which is not exactly apples to apples. NCL price to book value is .63. Their book value is $30 versus a now $19 price.NCL has a debt to equity ratio of .93 which is worse than CCL. The balance sheet does not reflect the age of the cruise ships though ideally the depreciation calculation should appropriately adjust the asset values (and often does not). I believe NCL has newer ships and more long-term debt relative to their equity.Both companies in my opinion had an aggressively bullish posture with their cash level. The difference is that NCL has made public their new acquisition of short-term debt. I cannot find any public statements from CCL regarding their short-term cash strategy.CCL has an annualized dividend payout of $2.00 per share. NCL has zero. I am no momentum trader but removing an existing dividend will likely hurt CCL's short-term price. NCL has no promised dividend to remove. If I knew what Carnival Cruise line's short-term strategy was in regards to their cash level, I would be more comfortable in focusing on the long-term prospects of each company.",0.9737
3368,"Does anyone know the reason why the prices shot up briefly to $14.20 this am, and dipped as low as $13.43?

But if the outcome of the vaccine is a possibility (Oct/Nov) why the share prices of MRNA is trading at only $73.69 (high $95.21) the last few weeks.

You can then sell the calls against you position and get $1.05-1.10. If the stock closes above $19.00 on Friday you will be out of you position at a net of 20.04 to 20.09 which would be a small profit. If the stock closes below $19.00 you get to pocket the $1.04 to $1.09 which reduce your basis.

Then again what is going to happen to the ships they own, who is going to own them ? I don't think that banks want to own cruise liner ships.I would appreciate any intelligent feedback to my questions.Thanks",0.9602

Dr Slaoui told Fox News in an interview earlier in the day that he was more worried about Americans who reject medical science and fear vaccines as unsafe or a conspiracy to harm the public.'The highest concern I have is the level of hesitancy within the population as to accepting whether they will be immunized or not,' Dr Slaoui said, pleading with people to keep an open mind. 'Please don't come to a conclusion before you have been exposed to the data.'General Gustave Perna said that within 96 hours of emergency use authorization for a coronavirus vaccine, the U.S. will have 'shots in arms.' With the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluating data from Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine trial on Thursday, that means the first dose given in the U.S. could be administered as early as next Monday.It comes as the seven-day rolling average of daily coronavirus deaths in the U.S. reaches its highest point in the pandemic, at over 2,000 a day and the nation crosses a grim threshold of more than 15 million cases since the first American COVID-19 case.

3651,"This will be my fourth Sat post. Last week I told you that NCL had entered a trading range of 16.40 to 19.00 and the accumulation/distribution was positive so expect further gains in the stock. In addition, I warned you that we could expect as much as a 10% correction in the market once the S&P hit 3573. I told you to buy on any down draft in the market. Finally, I surmised that the CDC decision would be the catalyst to take us to 30-32 in one to two months.So lets see what happened. On Tuesday and Wednesday the stock hit lows of 16.44 and 16.38 respectively and on Thursday hit a high of 19.20 before backtracking down to 17.21 on Friday. The S&P hit 3588 on Wednesday and by Friday hit a low of 3349 for a two day correction of 6.7%. Overall, a pretty good week for predictions.Let's see what the near term brings us.The A/D continues to remain positive and actually improved by the end of the week signally more short term gains. I believe the 16's are gone and that the stock will have a new trading range of 17.10-20.00. In the overall market, I'm not sure if the sell off is completed even though we rallied late Friday afternoon. The danger zone lasts another week so anything could happen on Tuesday or Wednesday. If you didn't invest some last week then this will be one of your last chances to get a bargain price. Check the new trading range and act accordingly.At this point I want to turn my attention to the CDC and the no sail ban. If you look at past history the CDC has always acted about two weeks the ban expires so I suspect we will get some news in the Sept. 16-18 time frame. I hate to dash your hopes but my guess is that they will not lift the ban entirely. (Yes, I know this will get me a bunch of thumbs down.)What I'm expecting is a more Solomonesq decision where they split the difference (a Biblical reference to where Solomon was going to split a baby between two mothers who claimed the baby to be their child). First, I expect the ban to be extended for a short time subject to the submission of health protocols by each of the three cruise liners. The CDC can sit on the protocols and make the lines revise them while it buys time to see when and if a vaccine is approved. The cruise lines have already said they won't sail until Dec 15., so a short term extension of the ban until Oct. 31 or Nov. 15 doesn't cost either side anything. The stock will price in the eventual lifting of the ban so after a day or two dip, the market will figure out what I just explained.Finally, let me close with my weekly admonition. Getting to 30-32 is a process that will extend over time--still one to two months. You should remain cautious to changing shifts in the market but optimistic about NCL's future and PPS.Shorts should have covered by now but they haven't, so the short squeeze above 20 will be the tinder to light the fire to 30.",0.9866

He also bases reasoning on investors getting tired of holding the stock due to cruises getting pushed back, which to some extent is true. But what he and others always fail to emphasize is that NCL has 2 billion in cash and could continue operations without a single passenger for at least the next 16 months at their current burn rate, and that's not considering other measures that could be taken to raise cash. They also fail to understand how loyal the customer base is, and how the booking rates for 2021 are very strong. When somewhat normal cruising returns, the floodgates will open with people who've been deprived of their favorite form of vacation. I see two significant bumps. The first coming when a vaccine is released and the second when revenues start streaming in again in 2021.

3715,"This is my sixth weekend post.Tough week for NCLH and for my predictions. Let's search through the rubble and see what we can discover. I said the trading range was 17.10 to 19.50, that we were likely to hear something from the CDC last week and that the no sail ban would likely be extended 30-45 days. Finally, I told you the market sell off was not over and we were likely to see 3100 before it ended.The low for the week was on Friday at 15.95 which blew away the support number on the trading range. No excuses but maybe an explanation. The numbers I give you are based on a formula that computes support and resistance ranges. In any given week support can break down on the down side or resistance can give way on the upside. These ranges are guides to help you trade and not a guarantee that the stock will remain within the range.We did not get anything from the CDC on the no sail edict.. The CDC is soliciting comments from the public on whether they should lift the ban. The comment period closes on Monday. Some of the comments have been published in the Federal Register. According to an article I read about 75% of the comments have been positive.Finally, the S&P dropped another 27 points after a strong start to the week. No change in the market structure so 3100 is still the target.I have no trading range this week. The CDC decision will move the stock outside of any trading range that I could calculate so sit back and wait. I have continually told you to be cautious but optimistic. This was never going to be easy with a company that is not operating and burning millions every month. For those of you holding for 50-60 this week was a taste of what is in store--many ups and downs so get used to it.There are a couple of ways to look at this week. From the short perspective, you can argue that traders dumped shares in anticipation of the ban being expanded for another three months. From the long perspective, you can argue that the market makers often drop a stock to pick off all the stop loss orders before positive news. On Fri. they picked off the stop losses at 16.00, 16.25 and 16.50. The low for the week before then was 16.71. A nice haul if that was the plan.I added shares on Friday.Finally, a note to the shorts. Companies do not go BK when they have more than a billion dollars in cash on hand. The bankruptcy court would NOT even entertain the petition so if you are a short get over it or at least educate yourself on the bankruptcy laws.The worst that is going to happen is that we will see more dilution in the stock like what we saw with Carnival this week. But that will not happen until Q2 2021 so exhale and let's see how this plays out next week.",0.9899
3716,"I personally cannot contribute any new arguments to CDC. I would like to avoid conflict with the CDC. With that being said, I do agree with points that have already been made by cruise CEOs and DeSantis. I think the CDC knows that a cruise is a more concentrated version of many of the places that have been allowed to open in the USA, so an extra urge of caution spawns in the minds of decision makers. It seems to me cooperation is being reached that will actually make cruises the most safe place to get away from covid. No one in power wants to ruin cruising, despite the jokes that have been made suggesting this. In the USA, theme parks are opening, restaurants, hotels, casinos, bars. What is a cruise? Cruise stocks are out of favor because of appearances of uncertainty. Maybe cruise stocks won't fall as hard on bad news as much as they will rise on good news, and with that being said I see progress and demand.",0.985

3720,"There is a fact to consider on this board: All non institutional investors have nearly zero impact on the price whether they buy or sell. Institutions own this stock and some big holders are exiting and other big holders are buying these days. The small investors stake will diminish as the price drops. Usually small investors buy high and sell low. It is an opportunity to take a position and average down as the price goes down. The day the good news break out, the price will take new highs very fast. Also those who are shorting at the price of these days are either professionals who are speculating for cheap buyout or believe the sector is hit for a long time. It is hard to know how fast people will start cruising again. All depends of course on the defeat of the decease, new guidelines for cruising and the progress of the cure /vaccine. If the airlines resume flying, it is more likely that cruising will resume shortly after. If one can make reservations to fly in May or June then this is a sign of when cruising will potentially resume. The tax factor is helpful because these companies have been paying low tax since they incorporated and can survive economically in tough times and reduce their staff and cut down on their expenses. Also since the oil dropped, they are in a position to hedge and offer competitive prices. People refuse to live in fears and will be tempted to buy offers at discount. I personally bought for August and have still time to cancel.",0.9778
3721,"A few key take away s from today’s CC:- Raised 2.4B to establish enough capital for 18 months of zero revenue environment. So as booking come in, obviously revenue will increase to buy even further time.- Q1 2020 was setting new records prior to COVID, despite the 40 Asia cancellations. Pent up demand has been evident as demand and bookings have continued even without travel agents or any sort of marketing in place. Expect marking to begin to pick up as itineraries solidify with host countries who have shown demand.- Cold layup costs are roughly $70M/mo. This can be offset as new and future bookings occur. Once they begin to get the fleet moving, expect 5 vessels per mo to startup. This is where NCL has an advantage over their peers, as their fleet of 28 vessels is far more manageable. In this unique case, the smaller company has an advantage over the much larger with less vessels to maintain and start up!- Their fleet is younger than their peers - they have top quality assets. This too is cost savings advantageous with a younger fleet.- NO significant debt maturing through 2021!- Future Asia and world cruise segments are already booked out.- Booking for 2021 is already on par with 2020 bookings from a year ago. Demand, without marketing, has remained high.- Acknowledged that safety of passengers and crew is essential. If he won’t put his own family onboard, they won’t start. This IMHO will breed into consumer confidence when they do begin to get back to business.- NCL has the highest yield before COVID. They see no reason NCL can’t have the best yield through COVID and beyond.- And they closed by stating they are extremely confident that NCL will be a COVID success story, but they can’t speak to their competition.BK wasn’t discussed once, nor asked about during Q&A. They are not going BK, at least not in 2020, so being short you must at a minimum acknowledge that. Call longs a bag holder all you may, but being short is just as much of a bag holder through 2020.Now sure the issue remains...COVID isn’t going away. But I have faith that testing first and foremost will become more widespread to truly understand what we’re against. How many already are asymptomatic? I also believe worldwide modern medicine will figure something out in 2020 to reduce fears. There remains risk in this company - but demand remains high and the rewards if (no...when!) we figure COVID out are substantial IMHO!",0.9907

We all know what happened: The CDC put the hammer down, and since PR is a U.S. Territory, NCL had to comply. Before March was done I had booked an almost identical itinerary for Christmas week. The funny thing is at the time NCL was saying on their website that they would resume cruises by May 1st. Well that didn't work out for them. NCL offered me and all booked cruisers a 150% refund. I used 100% towards my Dec. cruise and am letting the other 50% ride until later in 2021 when I'll go again.My point is simply that NCL was very generous. The airline Jet Blue OTOH took a hard-nosed approach and only put the $960 airfare in a ""travel bank."" When their cheap fares sold out for the day I wanted in December, I asked for a cash refund from my 03/14/2020 flight. Their response was ""We didn't cause the pandemic,"" so all you get is the travel bank credit. So I simply booked a cheap flight 2 days earlier, so I ""have to"" spend two full days doing nothing but vaca in San Juan, oh how terrible.I have zero qualms about getting back for my 6th cruise on a ""floating petri dish,"" and if as it is rumored St Kitts won't let us come into port there, then I know NCL will treat us right-probably find another port-of-call such as Charlotte Amalie at St Thomas in the USVI.And I have free onboard wifi, so if anything covid related happens I might check in here and give you the scoop first hand.Cheers, (yes I have the adult drinks package)",0.9924

They can always buy back shares at a later time. I realize it's frustrating to see the wages that these officers give themselves while we are in difficult times, but that is the nature of the beast. It would be most helpful if the CDC actually cared about the economic impact of their decisions but unfortunately they do not appear to care and will likely have to be forced into lifting there unreasonable restrictions.Note on pages 105 and 106 of 148 of the Annual Report under: Notes to the consolidated financial statements..The company states that they have 12 months of available cash on hand as of the release of these current financial statements to deal with all obligations including nine new ship orders. 6 under the Norwegian brand labeled the Project Leonardo delivery dates between 2022 to 2027...One for the Regent brand with delivery in 2023 and Two under the Oceania Cruises brand delivery 2023-2025.... none of the nine ships orders anticipate any contractual breaches or cancellations.The sooner the CDC gets their act together and stops playing politics the sooner cruising will resume.I would have no problem with them setting sites on the Bahamas..

4146,"NCLH closed at $26 in anticipation of vaccine hopes. Energy stocks have already started to rally hard last few days and the growth to value rotation is in its infancy. We have seen companies like NIO and more dilute the stock significantly only to go up stronger. Granted the comparison isn't justified, but dilution and debt are not the only parameters impacting the stock. The number one is greed, then FOMO and future growth prospects. I see more money coming in and once vaccine is approved a swift and violent rally pushing stock price upwards to $35+ and possibly even to $40 before a retracement to the low 30's.

Guys (and girls), I mean, it's all a matter of setting the expectations... if you expected the CEO to come on air and claim that cruising will resume in 2 weeks time, that's delusional. So lets be realistic here. Potentially no sailing in 2020. However, NCLH is still a relatively healthy company with sufficient cash to survive. At least that was my take away from the interview. As for all the other topics goes, restarting the economy is and will be SLOW. That's a fact. Need to be patient.

Money is nice and necessary but so is a healing hand.As a side note: I'd continue play WKHS ..and I'd keep an eye on COOP.... (Home loan service group)...if not this stock then keep an eye on companies emersed in Realestate/services, as housing is a big part of this economic growth and housing sales continues to do very well. Housing is ALWAYS a metric for an overall recovery coming. It will continue to grow exponentially as people move OUT of these decimated poorly run democrat run cities which are being allowed to be trashed ....and many companies and businesses are simply moving out (which represent a massive amount of the city's tax income base) these cities are going to be screwed and will be forced to raise the property taxes.These citizens are then going to exit the cities and the demand for housing sales will continue to rise. Realestate acquisition and sales is where the majority of my wealth originally came from. You can never go wrong in Realestate. (Assuming you know what you're doing).I would also watch ACER.. (Acer therapeutics), as its own president and CEO has been loading up on shares with a buy-back program as movement on private placements to the president with a minimum of 6 months holding period. Smells like something could be on the horizon 'covid therapeutic' related. Could possibly be a long play.They lost an FDA approval mid 2019 which tanked the stock.",0.9974

While the situation surrounding the virus is rapidly changing, Chaiken thinks recent liquidity enhancing moves taken by the three major companies provide cushion to ride out the storm.

We have seen downgrades from the analysts and Motley Fool tells us three times a week that the stock is a bad investment. For those of you who missed it Wedbush cut its price target on the stock from 26 to 20.If you analyze the situation from a rational standpoint the stock should have taken out its recent low in the 12's after the CC or after the Wedbush downgrade. But it didn't happen. What you are seeing is accumulation on every pullback and low volume days. The major selling for this stock is over unless we get a major market pullback.Note the pattern on Friday. Major weakness on the open after the downgrade. Stabilization mid day off the lows and buying at the close. This is a classic accumulation pattern and one you should watch repeated in the coming days.As many posters have said, you will need patience with the stock. The WSJ did an article that gave a time line for phase 3 results. Basically it said the earliest results are expected to be released in early October. The market will know what is happening long before the general public. All the phar companies are publicly traded and the companies will give the analysts that cover the stock a heads up on the results so their firm can front run the results. (No lectures on SEC enforcement, please). That means the winning pharm stocks and the leisure stocks should begin a real but gradual upturn by the middle of September.There is a timetable for you to watch. In the meantime, ignore all the posts about BK, debt and cash flow burn. The market always anticipates an actual turnaround in the fundamentals of a stock by about six months.Finally, a word of caution. The stock is poised to explode higher but do not think that it will hold those gains. These types of moves always have a serious retracement before the second leg up. 14 to 30 back down to 19 would be normal. You need to decide if you want to go through that before it happens.My first rule of investing is no one ever went BK taking a profit.",0.9949

4398,"Personally, I didnt know what to expect from the earnings report. Was unsure about the stock price. Earnings miss was expected. Loss widened. Sailing date is unknown. Liquidity for 15 months now. We know that there will be a vaccine before 12 months. In fact, a vaccine declared before end of the year is also highly likely. That anticipation should send shares up. Resumption of sailing will create another spike. Plus tech sector rotation will add more fuel to the fire. Why it went up today? Possible that the negative news was already factored in and the sector so badly beaten down that MM's are looking to get some cheap stock in case of a recovery. If you believe sailing has gone permanently, think again. Life doesn't stop. It comes back. People want to get out and they will. The world will open up. Maybe it doesn't go to $60, but between $30-$40 seems realistic. the BK talkers need to get facts right. This is not going BK.

4455,"What just happened with CCL is a bit complicated but I'll try to explain. A few months ago, some folks bought bonds from CCL that pay the holders 5.75% per year until 2024. (The bond is called a ""Senior Convertible Note"" but more on that later.)In 2024, the holders can either get their principal back or get the equivalent cash back in the form of stocks at whatever the price happens to be in 2024. Instead of having to pay these guys 5.75% for the next few years and then return their principal, CCL offered to ""buy"" their bonds back by giving the holders equivalent shares (worth $14.02 at the time of the transaction) today. About half the bondholders agreed. Last night they took shares from CCL in exchange for their claims to the following:-5.75% per year for four years-the principal cost of the bond-equivalent CCL shares in 2024AND because these were Senior Convertible Notes, they also give up these rights:-rights to any property, cash, investments, ships, or any assets that may remain after bankruptcy, less court and litigation costs and other fees.CCL received no cash from the transaction and, in fact, had to pay about $200m in fees. They diluted your shares to the tune of 5.5 millike and. The sell off premarket was some of these bondholders receiving and then immediately selling those shares for whatever price they can get for them. We can expect more selling from them in the next few days or weeks.We know why CCL did this--to free up about $1.5b in much needed cash that they'd owe between now and 2024. But now ask yourself: Why would the bondholders agree to give up all these benefits for just $14.02? Here are a few reasons:-they think shares will be worth less than $14.02 in 2024-they don't think CCL shares will exist in 2024-they don't think they will get their principal back in 2024-they don't think they'll get 5.75% each year until 2024-they don't think the value of assets after bankruptcy will be enough to return their principalIn short, about half the bondholders (e.g., ""smart money"" private hedge funds) decided that the above scenario is more likely than not and took the deal. Do with this information what you'd like and draw your own conclusions. But this is a very significant development that indicates the future direction of CCL.$nclh $rcl $ccl",0.9964

They want 'test' cruises to show that mankind is God and king over nature. Its incredibly absurd.It's ridiculous in my opinion for the CDC to think that they are going to eliminate a virus through protocols ...it's overly burdensome and unrealistic. Do they think they are going to control every aspect of our lives regarding someone catching a virus. Uhhh, actually that's exactly what they think.. I've coined it the 'Fauci delusional syndrome.' It's just unnecessary IMO. Especially with a 99.9% survival rate and that the vast majority of people on cruises are between 25 to 70 years old. That group has little to no issues with Covid,.. even if they get it ......Simply have passengers sign a waiver holding the cruise lines harmless if they should contract Covid under the guidance that the cruise lines are making realistic efforts to keep passengers safe and comfortable. Basically an indemnity clause. Which every small business including the cruise lines should employ.To think that man-kind is going to completely control a virus is incomprehensibly pompus.

Do not expect the CDC to be too favorable moving forward but they are going to HAVE TO act under extreme pressure. Not just from the frustration of regular citizens but more so from state leaders and politicians who are losing millions as the cruise industry continues to be burdened.The globe has still not been able to put 2 and 2 together and realize that a Covid 'case' does not necessarily equate to a Covid 'death' despite all the evidence at hand. This covid-19 virus STILL only adversely affects less than 1% of the population... but what can you do when most humans are sheep. Be smart and have vision as to where we will be in 6 months.Throw on top of all this ...the continued unrest from BLM and other leftist antagonist groups, ...defunding the police nonesense, ...Iranian bad players, and the passing of RBG (Supreme Court Justice) just 5 weeks before a major election......and you have a very nervous market.As far as I'm concerned it's imperative we fill the vacancy of RGB, as we all know what the dems plans are with this highly controversial mass 'mail-in-voting' (which is completely separate from absentee voting). Pelosi and the Dems will be pushing extremely hard to block any Supreme Court nomination by Trump, because Pelosi will want to further generate chaos from the November 3 election results.The chaos that will be generated as a result of this mail-in-voting' issues, will no doubt have go to the supreme court for final adjudication. And we will need all 9 justices...not 8.None of this however changes the basic fundamentals of NCLH. IMO, They WILL persevere and will come out on top of this all unfortunate 'structured' chaos.I feel the effects of all this unrest, as you do ..as with every $.50 cent move here, my NCLH holdings (alone) move $300,000k accordingly. We all live within our means. I suggest you all take a look at SRNE, as their Covi-Trace 30 minute spit test will be a game changer for the cruise industry and many other industries once they receive the EUA from the FDA.

If answers to both questions are quite positive, you better hold on to your shares for at least 2-3 years. My own analysis is that with the liquidity cushion of 18+ months of no voyage and high likelyhood of cruises starting in Q3 (just a few ships nonetheless) and increasing from Q4 onwards will put this company on quite profitable path. Are they going to loose money this year, Yes. However they earned $5.09 per share last year and they can get there again in 2 full years. When that happens, apply your own SP to earning ratio and come up with your target price. Until cruises are firmly scheduled and actually flagged off, the stock price will resemble ghost ship in the middle of an ocean. There is no point analyzing current day to day, stomach churning price swings, except to determine your own reasonable entry point. If you strongly believe the company or the stock will not survive this pandemic, you should short it.

No surprised here. The CDC put the no-sail order in place. As of now it goes through July 24th. So how in Gods name would ANYONE cruise in July??? Once again news today was NO surprise. The only way cruises can resume is if 1) CDC revises their no-sail order, 2) Secretary of Health and Human services declare covid no longer a threat to peoples safety.or 3) 100 days have passed from the beginning of No-sail order.But more importantly is that there MUST be an indemnity bill (protection against frivolous law suits beyond 'reasonable care taken') passed for WHEN cruising does resume.Pelosi is AGAINST such a bill being passed.

4754,"This is my eighth weekend post.Given everything that transpired this week, I think it is appropriate to review what happened and didn't happen, and how it impacted the different models I use. First, let me make a point that should be obvious. Models are mathematical formula that react to data. They DO NOT UNDERSTAND no sail bans or the health of the President. You input certain data points depending on the model and it projects a certain result. But there are factors that we as investors have to take into account which is what I'm going to do or at least attempt to do.The No Sail BanI have been predicting for a while that the ban would be extended for 30-45 days while the CDC and the cruise lines reworked the protocols but sailings would take place beginning in November. My prediction turned out to be correct as the no sail ban was extended by 30 days. But the Axios press release gave us the background which was not good The CDC and its head Robert Redfield were not on board with the decision. They wanted to extend the ban until Feb. 15, 2021. Florida is a toss up state and it appears this was a political decision. That appears to change everything. We saw that in the price action in the stock. we bolted out of the door and up to 18.23 as retail lifted the stock when the ban was lifted. The cautionary point was that we only traded 20M shares in the first hour rather than the 40M I expected and predicted. It is clear that the institutions didn't participate because they were not certain that the ban would be lifted after the election or reimposed at some point. The CDC's statement that cruise ships represent a continued health care risk and its general tone should give all investors a cause for concern.If the ban is extended to Feb. 15, it will mean that the cruise lines will not be profitable in 2021 or 2022 and this impacts the time frame when the stock will get back to the 50-60 level. This is a big deal and should not be brushed aside even by long term investors.The President's HealthThis is a total wildcard that no one could have anticipated. It is likely that we will see large drops and spikes in the market as various reports are released in the next week. Basically, if you are trading the stock it has become a #$%$ shoot. If you are a long term investor then all of this is just noise.With all that said, let's see what the models say. First, the intermediate model that had a 30-32 target box. It was disappointed with the price action this week. If you looked closely at the time frame of the waves you noticed that they last about four weeks. This one started on September 24, so we are about 30% of the way through the cycle. We were up for the week--at least at the close of the regular session. The model still projects a gain in the coming weeks but the target box has been reduced to 19.50 to 21.00.The model that predicts the trading range for the stock says the stock has entered a trading range. This week's trading range is between 15.90 and 18.50. Note that these two models disagree because this model looks at what happened on a weekly basis while the first model is projecting what is going to happen over three weeks.Finally, the model that looks at the S&P says everything is acting just as it should be. It says we are headed to about 3575 over the next three or four weeks with choppiness along the way. 500 point intraday swings are to be expected with an upward bias. It doesn't know or care what causes the swings and so the model says we are totally on course for a continuation of the upward trend.Finally, let me tell you how I played this week and what I am likely to do this week--MAYBE. When the stock moved up to 18.23 I was pleased but not happy with the volume. I knew we would get a pullback into the noon hour so I wasn't surprised by the pullback. Last week I told you that I follow Fibonacci rules and i do so on a daily basis as well as in the models. If you understand those rules the you know that 38.2, 50 and 61.8 are the prime numbers for FIB. We had moved about $1.60 from the Tuesday close to the Wednesday high That meant we could expect a pullback of 61 cents to 18.60 (38.2%) or at worst an 80 cents if we got a 50% pullback to 17.43. You have to live with this and see what happens--hoping that it begins a rise to the 18.00 level. The stock followed this pattern during the Barclays upgrade.For the next couple of hours the stock traded between 17.40 and 17.60 playing tag with investors. I'm sure the MM got a big laugh at all this. Somewhere about 1PM the stock broke support at 17.40 which meant I put in a sell order at 17.40 which got executed a couple of minutes later. That meant I had left 83 cents on the table which doesn't make me happy but that is life or so it would seem. l .",0.999

These are all POSITIVE moves as it shows the sincerity of the businesses. The best play to creat real wealth here is to develop a long position (if you haven't already) and RELAX. If the daily swings upset you, find a hobby or help a friend.OPEN THIS COUNTRY UP. Enough fear mongering people.And by the way, what happened to the MINUTE BY MINUTE fear coverage of covid ??? Oh thats right...a NEW top fear mongering story. My bad.",0.9843
4777,"This is my 9th weekend post.It turned out to be a rewarding week if you were long but there was a lot of backing and filling in NCL which tells us a lot about the future for the stock.Last week the model for the weekly high and the low in the stock gave us a trading range of 15.90 to 18.50. The low for the week was 16.69 and the high was 18.91 showing us a SMALL breakout to the upside.The intermediate term price range for NCL based on the fifth wave Elliott Wave analysis had a target box of 19.50 to 21.00. Last week I noted that there seemed to be a disparity between the trading range model and the intermediate term model but I cautioned you that they measured different time periods. The trading range model was for a week but the intermediate model was looking out three weeks. This week's move into the high 18 range closed much of the disparity between the two models. Finally, I told you that the S&P model which forecasts a high of 3575 was predicting 500 intraday point moves on the DOW with an upward bias. We got three 500 point moves on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.Let's see what the models are predicting for this week and the future.The trading range model shows us a range between 17.40 and 20.25. The intermediate term model's target box had a small upward revision of 19.75 to 21.25. You should note that the trading model and the intermediate term target box now overlap. That was why I commented last week about the disparity, just to give you a heads up that they would likely close over the coming weeks. We have now consumed about 60% of the time period of a normal wave 5 period. Wave 5 began on Sept. 24 and generally they last about a month, give or take a couple of days. Overall, this has been a disappointing move. We started at 14.15 and hit 18.91 on FRI. or just a total of 4.76. There should be one more final burst up to finish the wave with a total movement of about $7.00 off the bottom. Hence the target box top target of 21.25.The S&P model is forecasting fewer volatile days as the upward bias continues. It has finally produced a target box and surprisingly it targets a range of 3575 to 3650 which means we could actually see new all time highs.You will have decisions to make in the next couple of weeks. The volume in NCL for Mon-Fri rounded off to the nearest million was 15, 32, 17, 17, and 24. This is below average volume and shows that NCL is moving with the market and not on its own (another way of saying there is no investment accumulation). As I said last week in Part 2 the stock is likely to return to its mean of 16-17 once wave 5 ends unless there is some news to keep it at the current level.Finally, the S&P model continues to predict a sizeable sell off in November-December time period and the size of the sell off actually increased based on this week's price action. I will have more on the sell off in a couple of weeks when we near the end of the current rally.Finally, we began to see massive shorting in NCL at about 2PM on Fri. in the 18.85 to 18.90 range. This indicates that institutional shorts see the rally ending in NCL in a short period of time. I have no idea what they think a short period of time may be but you might want to note the price range and we will see how they do in the coming weeks.",0.9454

4799,Too much pressure on the CDC to let sailing resume! Plus the 70+ changes Healthy Panel plans to implement there is no way the CDC should extend no sail another month. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.travelpulse.com/news/travel-agents/asta-urges-cdc-to-end-no-sail-order.amp,0.8172
4800,"If you read the SEC filings, you will find that they actually have not accumulated that much debt (""relatively speaking""). However, you will find that the exchangeable notes and their front loaded PIK interest as well as the trailing cash interest causes the outstanding shares to be double Pre-Covid. (was 210,000) (will now be slightly over 420,000). So that means the previous pps that was roughly $60 can now only be $30 max. Now add in the logic that on the resumption of sailing much of value will return but not all the value. So your looking at maybe a pps of $24 on resumption.That being said there is now significantly better risk/reward value in hotels and REITs. I probably wont rebuy here unless it goes under $12 (which it likely wont), or the risk/reward becomes better over time.There is the possibility that in 5+ years with increased revs from the new ships that this could hit the $36 range, but as it stands right now there is no chance this hits over $30 now with the double the outstanding shares.Encourage people to read the SEC filings for themselves. The recent L Catterton filing would be a good place to start.",0.9949
