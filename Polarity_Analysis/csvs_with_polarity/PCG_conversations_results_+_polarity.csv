44,"PG&E Stock Is Rallying Because a Mediator Is Getting Involved in its Bankruptcy -- Barrons.comToday 1:36 PM ET (Dow Jones)PrintBy Alexandra ScaggsPG&E stock rallied 21% on Tuesday, even as wildfires continued to burn throughout California. The gains came as the judge overseeing the utility's bankruptcy appointed an official to mediate negotiations between two groups of investors vying for control of the company.Judge Dennis Montali of the Northern District of California appointed retired judge Randall Newsome to facilitate negotiations between the bankruptcy's competing factions in an order published late Monday.PG&E has proposed a reorganization plan that would retain some value for the company's shareholders, and reached an $11 billion settlement agreement with investors and insurers who own insurance claims covering wildfire losses. A coalition of bondholders and wildfire victims have proposed an alternate restructuring plan, which would render the current shares more or less worthless.Montali also ordered ""the principal parties to make a good-faith effort to mediate whatever issues can be identified with the help of...[an] experienced mediator."" His court is based in San Francisco.Elsewhere in the state, wildfires continued to spread. Northern California's Kincade Fire was 15% contained on Tuesday morning, according to the state's fire agency.PG&E warned residents that it plans to turn off power to nearly 600,000 customers starting Tuesday in an attempt to prevent wildfires. The utility shut down power to 970,000 customers over the weekend. It filed an incident report last week highlighting an issue with a transmission line near the ignition point of the Kincade Fire, which is still burning.The fire has grown to 75,415 acres but the reported damage has been relatively light thus far; Cal Fire counts two injuries. The agency says 124 buildings were destroyed and 23 more were damaged, but the Sacramento Bee reports that 90,000 buildings are threatened by the fire. About 180,000 Californians faced evacuation orders over the weekend because of the Kincade Fire.Even with Tuesday's gains, the stock is still down about 40% over the past two weeks.",-0.9187

For Sept, 2018, PG&E noted there was $71.4 billion in assets and $51.7 billion in liabilities. As of Sept, 2019, that figure has changed to $85.7 billion assets and $76.7 billion in liabilities. The difference changed from $19.7 billion stockholder's equity as of Sept, 2018 to just $9 billion in stockholder's equality a year later. Bankruptcy is not scheduled to be completed until June, 2020, so it depends what they can rack up on liabilities between now and then.",0.8863
48,"PG&E Receives State Approval for Investments Aimed at Improving Safety, Reducing Wildfire Risk and Building a Stronger Energy System for the Future11:35 am ET December 3, 2020 (BusinessWire) Print--Investments Include Efforts to Further Reduce Customer Impacts of Public Safety Power Shutoffs--Company Proposes Cost Savings Initiatives to Help Reduce Customer CostsToday, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved most aspects of a multi-party settlement agreement between Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E or the Utility) and customer advocacy, labor and safety groups that resolved PG&E's 2020-2022 General Rate Case (GRC), which includes the Utility's ongoing efforts to reduce wildfire risk and to continue delivering safe and reliable service to customers.The GRC decision enables necessary investment in PG&E's electric and gas distribution systems and power generation infrastructure, including investments to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires through electric system hardening, enhanced vegetation management, system automation, and asset inspection and repair.The GRC also enables PG&E to continue its efforts to make Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) events smaller in size, shorter in duration and smarter in execution. Those efforts include devices that limit the size of outages to impact fewer customers; temporary generators to provide power to essential services and communities that would otherwise be shut off for safety; crews for inspection and restoration efforts; and customer notifications in 13 languages that provide estimates about when power will be shut off and restored.""The safety of our customers and communities we are privileged to serve is where everything begins for PG&E. It's our most important responsibility. We want to work to exceed our customers' expectations when it comes to safely and reliably delivering clean energy, reducing wildfire risk in an ever-changing climate, and building a safe and sustainable energy system. We are pleased that today's action by the Commission approves much of the negotiated multi-party settlement, which allows us to continue those efforts and underscores our commitment to the 16 million people we serve,"" said Robert Kenney, PG&E Vice President, Regulatory and External Affairs.",0.9979

We currently have half a million electric cars on the road in California—an excellent accomplishment–but a lot remains to be done by 2030.

85,"So, let's say PCG doesn't declare BK... Not that I think it's gonna happen. They are waiting for the 15 days to pass, but let's just pretend. PCG has liquidity. They had a draw on their line of credit of $3B. They aren't paying bondholders and they had cash, but they are getting sued and can't borrow since they have junk credit. Can't use DIP since that is BK contingent money. Judgments come in. The bondholders don't get paid and force PCG into BK by declaring default. So, it's an involuntary bankruptcy then. The company has to pay $30B plus principal and interest on bonds that will mature as time goes by. PCG has less than $3B available. Maybe way less? So, at some point, they run out of cash while paying the judgments. I don't get Blue Mountain's argument since they have cash now but it will start running out fast once those lawsuits start running and legal fees skyrocket. PCG will do the most logical thing, file for BK and emerge out of it within 2 years... Most of the employees will keep their jobs, insurance companies will take a haircut since they will not get as much in subrogation, the insureds got paid...

The fire burned for two weeks in the Sierra Nevada mountains after starting Sept. 27, destroying 204 structures before it was brought under control.PG&E said it fully cooperated with Cal Fire’s investigation and looks forward to reviewing the report and evidence collected when allowed to do so. California’s largest utility remains focused on mitigation efforts to prevent future wildfires, it said in a statement.The company said in December it expected to take a $275 million pretax charge in connection with the fire. PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2019 after its equipment was blamed for a string of deadly fires, including the Camp Fire that killed 85 people.PG&E renewed its liability insurance coverage for wildfire events in July 2020 for $867.5 million, the company said in a December filing.

215,"Since June 8, 2020 when PCG was trading at 12.57, the Company has lost 30% of its market value. Why? What has happened in those 12 days? The answer: NOTHING! Nothing except some good things, that is. The Company received confirmation of its plan of reorganization and completed several debt offerings (heavily oversubscribed) and an equity offering (a modest success), and expects to emerge from bankruptcy tomorrow. So why did the Company loose 30% of its market cap? That is a question you have to ask yourselves, because nothing really substantive happened to adequately explain it. Some people are saying the underwriters were unprepared and did not support the offering price. Some say it is the dilution, but the ""dilution"" added $9 billion to the Company's coffers. Some say it is the risk of renewed wildfires this season. But you would have to be really silly to believe that PCG would let that happen when they have been given permission to cut power to risky areas. Still others believe it is the State's inability to fully fund it's wildfire obligations, although it seems likely some additional time and/or some sub-acute financial engineering will be able to solve that problem. And some will say the very lawyerly recitation of all the possible risks in the world enumerated in the prospectus have scared people off the stock. But really none of those things should have affected the market value of an essential monopolistic utility like PG&E, with audited shareholder equity of $22,863 million by 30%, really.

241,"NEWS OUT; $16 is the next RESTINGbefore it's HEADING TO ZERO when COMMON CANCELLED - READ...Do Options Traders Know Something About PG&E (PCG) Stock We Don't?March 26, 2019, 5:40 AM PDTInvestors in Pacific Gas and Electric Company PCG need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Mar 29, 2019 $16 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for PG&E shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, PG&E is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Utility – Electric Power industry that ranks in the Top 29% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has decreased from $1.00 per share to 94 cents.Given the way analysts feel about PG&E right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

This year’s payments reflect the substantial local investments we are making in our gas and electric infrastructure to create a safer and more reliable system and to better mitigate against wildfire risk,"" said Chris Foster, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for PG&E.On April 12, PG&E paid property taxes of more than $268 million to the 50 counties in which it owns property. The payment covers the period from January 1 to June 30, 2021. Total payments for the tax year of July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 are more than $537 million.PG&E pays franchise fees to cities and counties for the use of public streets for its gas and electric facilities. The energy company is submitting the fees by April 15.PG&E’s franchise fee payments totaled more than $138 million – more than $42 million for natural gas and nearly $96 million for electric service.In 2020, PG&E invested about $7 billion to enhance and upgrade its gas and electrical infrastructure for safety, reliability and wildfire mitigation across Northern and Central California, and the increase in property tax payments reflect those continuing investments.PG&E supports the communities it serves in a variety of ways. Last year, PG&E and the PG&E Corporation Foundation provided $17.5 million in charitable contributions in communities throughout Northern and Central California to enhance educational opportunities, preserve the environment, and support economic vitality and emergency preparedness. This included more than $1 million in relief to communities and small businesses for COVID 19 impacts. PG&E employees provide volunteer service in their local communities.

418,"WARNING WAS 2 Days Ago - READbefore it's HEADING TO ZERO when COMMON CANCELLED - READ...Do Options Traders Know Something About PG&E (PCG) Stock We Don't?March 26, 2019, 5:40 AM PDTInvestors in Pacific Gas and Electric Company PCG need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Mar 29, 2019 $16 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for PG&E shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, PG&E is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Utility – Electric Power industry that ranks in the Top 29% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has decreased from $1.00 per share to 94 cents.Given the way analysts feel about PG&E right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

This contact caused blazing hot molten materials to drop dropped into the dead and dry fuels below the conductor, which ignited the devastating Camp Fire. It is further alleged that on the afternoon of November 8, 2018, a day before the fire, PG&E’s aerial patrol observed damage to a steel transmission tower on the transmission circuit at what turned out to be the origin site of the Camp Fire.“PG&E has an obligation to regularly inspect and maintain its power lines, which in some cases are nearly 100 years old, but it has failed time and again to do just that,” said Dario de Ghetaldi.“This Fire was the result of PG&E’s long-standing ‘run-to-failure’ mentality.

PLEASE READ WHAT'sgoing to happen to your shares;What happens to the stock of a company that goes bankrupt?In the event that a publicly listed company declares bankruptcy, the company's shareholders may be entitled to a portion of the liquidated assets, depending on which shares they hold and how much liquid assets are left over. However, the stock itself will become worthless, leaving shareholders unable to sell their defunct shares. Therefore, in the case of corporate bankruptcy, the only recourse is to hope there is money left over from the firm's liquidated assets to pay the shareholders.Upon bankruptcy, a firm will be required to sell all of its assets and pay off all debts. The usual order of debt repayment, in terms of the lender, will be the government, financial institutions, other creditors (i.e., suppliers and utility companies), bondholders, preferred shareholders and, finally, common shareholders. The common shareholders are last because they have a residual claim on the assets in the firm and are a tier below the preferred stock classification. Common shareholders often receive nothing at all, as there is usually very little left over once a firm has paid its debts.The amount of the payment a common shareholder will receive is based on the proportion of ownership they have in the bankrupt firm. For example, suppose that a common stockholder owns 0.5% of the firm in question. If the firm has $100,000 to pay to its common shareholders post liquidation, this owner would receive a cash payment of $500.If a shareholder owns preferred shares, he or she will have an increased chance of receiving a payment upon liquidation because this class of ownership has a higher claim on assets. Investors should consider the possibility of bankruptcy when evaluating potential investments. Ratios such as debt/equity and book value can provide investors with a sense of what they may receive in the event of bankruptcy. (See also: An Overview of Corporate Bankruptcy.)",0.9945

California's core rate regulation is among the most constructive in the U.S. with usage-decoupled revenue, annual rate true-up adjustments, and forward-looking rate setting. Regulators continue to support the company's investments in grid modernization, electric vehicles, and renewable energy to meet the state's progressive energy policies, all of which require rate increases. State legislation passed in August 2018 and mid-2019, and just this week should help limit shareholder losses if fires hit PG&E's service territory.BEARS SAY:PG&E depends almost entirely on regulators to approve rate hikes to cover its ambitious investment/recovery program. A cut in regulated rates could jeopardize earnings growth. Unlikely, as state just increased the gas tax again today (now a record 50 cents per gallon) July 1st to raise revenue and PG&E could see the same state tax mandate to help fund monstrous state deficits, the utility fire fund, and infrastructure modernization.It isn't likely that PG&E will be able to pay a dividend until late 2023 at the earliest, based on regulatory requirements as part of its bankruptcy exit. Expect a continued corresponding discount to peers until reinstated. Future safety lapses could lead to a state takeover with another round of large losses for shareholders.

PHOTOGRAPHER: GABRIELLE LURIE/SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE/POLARISPG&E Fanned the Flames That Made California BurnThe bankrupt, distrusted utility with a criminal past is crucial to the state’s plan to slow climate change.By and February 28, 2019, 5:00 AM ESTLaine Mason arrived at work on Nov. 8 expecting a busy day: Strong winds were forecast, which meant falling branches and toppled trees, and with them the possibility of downed power lines. Mason, who lives in the Northern California town of Corning, works for Pacific Gas & Electric Co. as what’s known as a “troubleman.” A 50-year-old former logger, he drives a robin’s-egg-blue PG&E bucket truck and wields a chainsaw and a 6-foot-long fiberglass hot cutter that can sever live power lines. In his words, “If you call PG&E and say, ‘Hey, my lights are out,’ they send me out to figure out what’s going on.”That morning, Mason and two fellow troublemen were waiting for assignments in the company’s yard in Chico. At around 6:45, the others were sent out to deal with an outage on nearby Flea Mountain. A little later, Mason’s boss called and told him to head to Paradise, a town in the Sierra Nevada foothills, where another of his co-workers needed help. Mason could already see smoke, and on the road he passed a steady stream of cars headed the other way. In the time it took to drive 15 miles, a small blaze that had been spotted a few miles from Paradise had exploded into a wind-whipped, galloping monster. He was just outside town when the inferno arrived. “I saw the treetops start swirling around,” Mason says, “and within five minutes it was like midnight—the fire was there, the smoke was there.”Mason worked all that day in Paradise, clearing fallen poles and lines. For a while he partnered with a team from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, opening paths through the downed debris so the firefighters could go house to house urging holdouts to evacuate. He stayed on the south side of town, where the blaze was less intense, moving downhill when it edged closer, watching houses around him combust and smolder. His co-worker, he later discovered, had been trapped in the gridlock created by panicked evacuees on the north side and had survived by moving to the center of a large parking lot. Mason worked until 10 that night, went to Chico to grab a bite, then drove back up. When he finally left, he’d been on the clock for more than 36 hours.His cleanup assignment in Paradise lasted two and a half more weeks. For the most part, people were happy and grateful to see him. A few, though, seeing his truck, would yell profanities and flip him off. A PG&E mechanic he knew was spit on at a fast-food place. Others got called murderers. Mason knew why: The day the fire started, PG&E had filed a report with its regulator, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), raising the possibility that the utility itself had caused the inferno—at 6:15 that morning there had been an outage on a transmission line on the hillside east of Paradise where the fire was first reported. Later examination showed an insulator and jumper wire that had broken loose from the tower, and a “flash mark” where the damaged equipment, swinging free, could have created an electrical arc, sending sparks into the parched vegetation below. In a follow-up filing, the utility mentioned a second outage a few miles away from the first and a half-hour later—the Flea Mountain outage. It could have been a second ignition point.PG&E-3-CMSA PG&E crew cleans up in Paradise on Nov. 10The Camp Fire, as it was named, proved the deadliest and most damaging blaze in California history—85 people were killed, most of them in Paradise, and 18,800 buildings were destroyed. Cal Fire won’t conclude its investigation into the cause for months, possibly years, but the realization that PG&E’s equipment might be the culprit led in short order to a collapse in the utility’s stock price, the resignation of its chief executive officer, and, on Jan. 29, a declaration of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Survivors of the fire, along with insurers and the town of Paradise, have already brought more than 40 lawsuits against PG&E, adding to 700 suits already on the books for its role in deadly fires that ravaged the state’s wine country in 2017. The plaintiffs’ attorneys—and angry protesters at the utility’s regulatory hearings and its San Francisco headquarters—portray a company whose negligence led to death and disaster. PG&E’s defense is that, for reasons beyond its control, it’s become impossible to prevent these catastrophic fires, no matter how careful the company is.In the coming months, judges, juries, regulators, and politicians, not to mention PG&E’s",-0.8444

Legislators who in the past were staunch supporters have also distanced themselves.""Nobody in the building is willing to offer PG&E a bailout,"" said state Sen. Jerry Hill, a Democrat and longtime critic of the company.The absence of support from California political leaders in the lead up to the bankruptcy filing contributed to the decline of its stock and a downgrade in its bonds, according to analysts.Soon after the company's Tuesday chapter 11 filing, Mr. Newsom said in a brief statement that his focus ""remains protecting the best interests of the people of California.""A company that was once one of the most influential in Sacramento and regularly got its way on legislation and regulation now has few defenders left.

805,"Judge Alsup Proposes Revised Additional Probation Conditions to Protect Public From ‘Further Death and Destruction Resulting From PG&E-Caused Wildfires’Wed 03/06/2019 13:28 PMRelevant Document:Revised Order to Show CauseOn Tuesday, March 5, Judge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a “revised” order to show cause why the court should not modify PG&E’s probation conditions. Noting that “the offender’s unsafe conduct led to a deadly pipeline explosion and to six felony convictions,” Judge Alsup explains that the unsafe conduct has now “led to recurring deadly wildfires caused by its electrical system.”In the revised order, Judge Alsup proposes the following new probation conditions “to protect the public from further death and destruction resulting from PG&E-caused wildfires, to deter similar wrongs by other utilities, and to promote the rehabilitation of PG&E among other goals of 18 U.S.C. §§ 3553(a)(1) and (a)(2)”: PG&E must “fully comply with all applicable laws concerning vegetation management and clearance requirements.” The order indicates that the court accepts Cal Fire’s interpretation of California Public Resources Code section 4293. PG&E must “fully comply with the specific targets and metrics set forth in its amended 2019 wildfire mitigation plan [], including with respect to enhanced vegetation management.” The order provides, however, that such compliance “will not excuse any failure to fully comply with the vegetation laws” as required under the first condition. The third-party monitor retained in connection with PG&E’s federal criminal convictions related to the 2010 San Bruno gas explosion must “assess PG&E’s wildfire mitigation and wildfire safety work, including through regular, unannounced inspections of PG&E’s vegetation management efforts and equipment inspection, enhancement, and repair efforts.” Those inspections would include “both inspections of segments of power lines where PG&E has conducted its enhanced vegetation management efforts pursuant to its amended 2019 wildfire mitigation plan, as well as areas where enhanced vegetation management has yet to occur.” The inspections would also include “field interviews and questioning of PG&E employees and contractors.” PG&E must “maintain traceable, verifiable, accurate, and complete records of its vegetation management efforts.” On the first business day of every month, PG&E must report to the monitor “its vegetation management status and progress” and make all related records available for inspection at the monitor’s request. PG&E must “ensure that sufficient resources, financial and personnel, including contractors and employees, are allocated to achieve the foregoing.” If it cannot find enough contractors, PG&E must “hire and train its own crews to trim and remove trees.” In order to “ensure that sufficient financial resources are available for this purpose,” PG&E “may not issue any dividends until it is in compliance with all applicable vegetation management requirements as set forth above” (emphasis added).A hearing on the revised order is scheduled for April 2 at 11 a.m. ET. The revised order establishes March 22 at 3 p.m. ET as the deadline for parties to show cause why PG&E’s probation conditions should not be modified.BackgroundThe revised order states that it supersedes the court’s Jan. 9 order to show cause and “takes into account the large number of submissions to date.” As indicated in the revised order, the Jan. 9 order required the parties to show cause why PG&E’s probations conditions should not be modified to, among other things, “require PG&E to reinspect its electrical grid, remove or trim all trees or branches that might make contact with PG&E’s equipment during high-wind events, and de-energize any part of its electrical grid not yet rated as safe by PG&E for the wind conditions then prevailing.” PG&E, and separately Cal Fire and the California Public Utilities Commission, respectively, filed written responses to the Jan. 9 order.On Jan. 17, the court issued a tentative finding that “the single most recurring cause of the large 2017 and 2018 wildfires attributable to PG&E’s equipment has been the susceptibility of PG&E’s distribution lines to trees or limbs falling onto them during high-wind events.”At the Jan. 30 hearing on the Jan. 9 order and other matters, the court decided it would not impose new probation conditions at that time and ordered the parties to make various filings. PG&E filed a copy of its SB-901-mandated wildfire-mitigation plan with the court on Feb. 6. In addition, Cal Fire and PG&E filed their respective responses regarding whether California Public Resources Code section 4293 mandates the trimming of tree limbs that overhang power lines.",0.9988

I fully anticipated going long this time but missed the dip to $8 range as I got in too soon before they announced the dilution. However, the company made all the right moves here so that anything from here on is likely to be news about its improving conditions that should set this stock on a long path north. It really is going to be a different company in a lot of ways, but mitigating fire concerns, a PUC that is more watchful, and investing more into infrastructure will see positive benefits. In addition, being a regulated monopoly with future rate increases as well as financing this current debt at low rates should really help PG&E down the road. Lastly, there really is no way to take local or state governments seriously about taking over any of PG&E as it is just too expensive and none of these political bodies could afford to operate its system.

SEE ""Equipment malfunctionedPG&E Replaces Head of Electric SystemExecutive shift comes as California utility grapples with potential exposure to deadly wildfiresBy Chris Wack Jan. 8, 2019 10:28 a.m. ETPatrick Hogan, senior vice president of electric operations at its Pacific Gas and Electric Co. unit, is set to retire on Jan. 28, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Hogan joined PG&E in 2013.On Jan. 4, the Pacific Gas and Electric board elected Michael Lewis as senior vice president of electric operations effective Jan. 8, the company said in the filing. He succeeds Mr. Hogan as principal executive officer of the utility and reports to the board. Mr. Lewis’s annual salary will be $450,000 and he will receive a one-time promotional cash award of $125,000.The executive shift comes as PG&E grapples with its potential exposure to November’s Camp Fire, the deadliest in California history. State investigators haven’t determined whether PG&E equipment played a role in the fire, but the company has disclosed that there was a malfunction in the area around the time the fire started.On Monday, shares plunged 22% as worries that the company might be forced to seek bankruptcy protection over its fire-related liabilities mounted.Late Monday, S&P Global Ratings cut its ratings on PG&E Corp. to speculative-grade, or “junk,” territory, citing the company’s recently announced review of its management and “structural options.”PG&E said on Friday that it would hire a search firm to replace or add board members to its existing 12-person board.",0.9037

894,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom is urging a federal judge to reject Pacific Gas and Electric's blueprint for getting out of bankruptcy and renewing his threat to lead a bid to turn the beleaguered utility into a government-run operation.In a court filing Wednesday, Newsom's lawyers gave a sternly worded rebuke of PG&E's plan, escalating the intrigue in a year-old bankruptcy case that will determine the fate of the nation's largest utility. PG&E is trying to dig out of a financial hole created by more than $50 billion in claims stemming from a series of catastrophic wildfires that have been blamed on the San Francisco company.Although he doesn't have the power to block PG&E's preferred route out of bankruptcy, the Democratic governor has tremendous leverage because the company's plan hinges on its ability to draw upon a special insurance fund California created last summer to help insulate utilities from potential wildfire losses in the future.PG&E did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Newsom fired his latest salvo on the eve of a scheduled hearing before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali that will cover a wide range of unresolved issues in the complex case.",-0.9517

If bondholders win, book value goes to $3 billion and stock to less than $6.- PG&E will likely be off the hook for all future fires due to recent legislation (AB 1054)So, while Citi analyst was at $10.50, I was at $11.75 tops.

Tesla offers solar panels for energy production, and batteries for storage ranging in size from home backup to full grid support such as the Hornsdale, Australia Power Reserve. Tesla and PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG) are working toward the largest battery backup in the world in Moss Landing, California, as shared by InsideEVs. The site has 256 Tesla Megapacks totaling 730MWh of energy storage, equivalent to 7,300 Tesla Model S Long Range vehicles. At completion, this will be the largest battery storage facility in the world, but there are always bigger systems being built.""The system will be designed, constructed, and maintained by PG&E and Tesla, and will be owned and operated by PG&E,"" according to PG&E. Construction began in July 2020. PG&E expects the Moss Landing storage facility to save more than $100 million over the 20-year life of the project. The system contains the option to upsize if PG&E would like to expand. Tesla can provide more batteries than can relatively easily be added on in the case of an expansion.",0.992

941,"Too big to fail .....The press release:15 Things You Need to Know About PG&E’s Oct. 9-12 Public Safety Power ShutoffDuring the PSPS Event￼1. PG&E crews and contractors inspected nearly 25,000 miles of distribution lines and 2,500 miles of transmission lines after the event, a combined distance that’s longer than a trip around the Earth.2. More than 100 instances of damage were found during inspections, including trees into lines and downed power lines, with the analysis of additional damage reports ongoing. It is possible that any one of these instances could have been a potential source of ignition had a PSPS not been initiated.3. PG&E’s meteorologists and fire-weather experts participated in daily interagency calls with experts from multiple National Weather Service (NWS) offices and the Northern Operations Predictive Services. All the experts were aligned that this was a very high fire risk event and had all the ingredients necessary for significant fires. The National Weather Service issued a Red Flag Warning that lasted from Wednesday afternoon until Friday morning that included locations where 2.1 million of PG&E’s customers live. The Red Flag Warning encompassed a larger area than the PSPS footprint. Maximum wind gusts exceeded 50 mph in 16 counties impacted by the PSPS event: • Sonoma County: 77 mph • Contra Costa County: 75 mph • Tehama County: 61 mph • Sierra County: 59 mph • Butte County: 56 mph • Napa County: 54 mph • Santa Cruz County: 54 mph • Placer County: 53 mph • Yolo County: 53 mph • Solano County: 53 mph • Alameda County: 52 mph • Humboldt County: 52 mph • Kern County: 51 mph • Lake County: 51 mph • Mendocino County: 51 • Santa Barbara County: 50 mph4. The vast majority of the 738,000 customers in 35 counties impacted by the PSPS were restored within 48 hours.5. Representatives from CAL FIRE, the CPUC and Cal OES were in PG&E’s Emergency Operations Center, participating in discussions. The company also held twice daily calls with state agencies and calls with county agencies three times a day. To prepare for wildfire season, weekly meetings were held with state agencies and 17 planning workshops were held with cities, counties and public-safety agencies.6. In all, 6,300 personnel, including PG&E workers and contractors, supported the PSPS.7. PG&E dispatched 44 helicopters to do aerial inspections.8. PG&E’s Customer Care team completed multiple daily notifications to customers before, during and after the event. This includes notifications and support of more than 30,000 Medical Baseline customers.9. PG&E opened more than 30 Community Resource Centers in PSPS-affected areas, providing water, restrooms, phone-charging and other services. In all, more than 5,400 customers visited a CRC.10. PG&E placed advertisements on TV, radio and digital sites. The company used Facebook, its nine Twitter accounts, and NextDoor to share updates on the PSPS and conducted more than 900 interviews with media during the event.Before the PSPS Event11. In 2012, just 15% of PG&E’s territory was designated as having an elevated wildfire risk on the fire-threat maps in effect at that time. Today, in 2019, approximately 50% of the service area is in Tier 2 or Tier 3 high fire-threat areas.12. PG&E’s electric infrastructure underwent an unprecedent inspection and repair process earlier this year. More than 700,000 electric-system poles, towers and substations were inspected, and any items needing immediate repair were repaired.13. To prepare for wildfire season, PG&E sent letters/emails to about 5 million customers; sent out more than 7 million PSPS-related emails; participated in 998 meetings with cities, counties, customers and community groups; and held 23 community open house events throughout the service area.14. PG&E has installed 600 weather stations and 100 high-definition cameras in high fire-threat districts for increased situational awareness. PG&E also has deployed its Satellite Fire Detection and Alerting System, which incorporates data from five satellites to provide advanced warnings of new potential fire incidents.15. PG&E reached out to its customers to make sure the company had accurate contact information. So far this year, 246,932 customers have updated their information including 10,966 Medical Baseline customers.",0.9937

The CPUC cited shortcomings in our 2020 Enhanced Vegetation Management, which is part of our comprehensive Community Wildfire Safety Program. The first step directs us to submit a corrective action plan and progress reports to the CPUC.The findings received today are consistent with concerns raised in prior reports from the CPUC and our Federal Monitor about our Enhanced Vegetation Management program. We continue to take this feedback seriously. We have already implemented improvements to this program and will continue to do so as outlined in our 2021 Wildfire Mitigation Plan (WMP).We will promptly prepare the corrective action plan to address the issues in the draft resolution, with clear timelines and commitments. We are committed to this critical work, and we welcome continued feedback and oversight from the CPUC and other stakeholders as we continue to learn, adapt and strengthen our system for the long term.PG&E (PCG) shares the CPUC’s focus on safety and recognizes that we must take a leading role in reducing the risk of wildfires throughout our service area. We understand that the most important responsibility that we have as a company and as individuals is to keep our customers, communities and our workforce safe.

1003,"Have been reading all the conversations.. have been interesting to see everyone's view point as well. I have been following this company since their downfall 2 years back. Have never posted anything before but I would like to just voice my 2cents opinion.1. I bought the company stocks at 4+ after they announced that Kincaid wildfire was 30% under control. Sold some and rebought again at 6+, 7+ and 9+. 2. The simple reason I believe the stock will hit higher is because of a fundamental that i believe, (I am not a American and neither do i really understand how the law works in US), Utility companies such as this, in my country, cannot go bankrupt. Worse case scenario, a takeover would also work out well for the stock because the company still owns assets and its worth a lot of money other than just zero.3. If the company really goes bankrupt, who will run the powergrid? A company that is bankrupt does not own assets and who runs the power grid?4. Even if the state decided to take over, there is still a price to pay and the shares will still worth something. 5. Victims need to be paid, i agree, even if i was a victim, i would demand for payment. However, if you are investing, keep the emotions out of what you are investing because it will cloud ones judgement.6. I will never understand people who is not into this counter would still comment here to ask others to sell.. well unless they short it themselves i guess.",0.997

1012,"Not sure why everyone is panicking. All these actions and it’s still only up or down a few percentage. Remember we were at low $10 about 2.5 weeks ago. The votes was priced in, cpuc votes might be priced in as well (but I doubt it), but the bk exit n wild fire fund isn’t priced in yet. On the flip side victims trust, dilution n no dividends are most likely priced in after victims made a fuss about it. I think all down side n most up sides have been released. So it’s only going up from now, as someone had pointed out, after they got out of their last bk they were worth about $20-30ish. Even if I have to hold it for a year that’s 250-400% profit.As for debts, yes they are getting into more debts. But it’s going to equipment upgrade, meaning their assets value will increase as well. Imagine a house build back in 1900 with no fixing vs the same house with upgrades and improvements. One will value higher than the other for sure. And as far as I know, those area that were burn down before due to wild fire will now have grid buried underground to prevent future fire. Which makes sense. Hard n definitely impossible to build grid under ground in a already established city/town. But if you are Re-building On nothing then it’s easier n much cheaper to build grid underground.Lastly, pcg exiting bk n getting the wild fire fund is a must. Too much are riding on it for them not to get into the fund. The wild fire fund protects the current settlement from future wild fire. Without that fund, the current settlement can be thrown into a downward spiral if there’s another wild fire n it gets added to the case. So it’s in the victims, insurance, bondholders, employees, Cali, and pcg’s best interest if they can tap that fund",0.9902

PG&E stock is down 22.2% as of 1:15 p.m. EST in response.Power lines in California.Power lines in California.Image source: Getty Images.So whatIn related news, CNBC cited other sources today in reporting that PG&E could face ""at least $30 billion"" in claims over its role in the 2017 and 2018 wildfires -- and that number doesn't even include ""penalties, fines or punitive damages,"" so $30 billion could be the floor value on PG&E's liability.Now whatOf course, all of PG&E is currently valued at less than $10 billion in market capitalization, a fact that suggests that paying $30 billion in claims could be something of a stretch. So while Reuters cautions that ""a bankruptcy filing is not certain"" and ""is just a possibility,"" it is looking more and more likely the larger the potential claims become.Thus the reason investors are selling PG&E stock for less than $20 a share today: because they think that's a much better deal than $0.",0.9575

1058,"PG&E Power Line Near California Wildfire Had Damage10:27 pm ET December 11, 2018 (Dow Jones) PrintBy Russell GoldPG&E Corp. released new information indicating that one of its power lines was damaged immediately prior to the beginning of the massive Camp Fire in northern California last month that killed at least 86 people and destroyed 18,800 buildings.In a filing with state regulators on Tuesday, PG&E said a large power line stopped working shortly before the fire began. The energized power line and insulator appear to have separated from one of the metal towers that held it aloft, the company said. It also found ""wear at the connection point.""California investigators haven't determined whether PG&E equipment caused the Camp Fire, the deadliest in state history, and the company stressed in the Tuesday filing that the cause remains under investigation. But the disclosure of equipment problems immediately prior to the fire increases the likelihood that PG&E could be found responsible, exposing the company to billions of dollars in fire-related liability costs.The utility previously disclosed to regulators that the 115,000-volt line suddenly lost power at 6:15 a.m. that morning on Nov. 8, some 15 minutes before the start of the Camp Fire was reported. The state is expected to take months to issue its findings on the cause of the fire.California law makes PG&E potentially responsible for damages if its equipment started the wildfire, regardless of whether the company is found to have acted negligently. Concerns that PG&E would be liable for damages sent the company's stock price down dramatically in the aftermath of the fire. Its shares are down about 45% since the fire.The state's fire investigator, Cal Fire, is still probing whether PG&E equipment helped cause the worst in a series of 2017 fires that charred the state. But it has found PG&E responsible for 17 major fires in 2017 that destroyed 3,256 structures and killed 22 people. Eleven of those cases have been referred to county district attorneys for possible criminal charges against PG&E.State regulators had said they expect PG&E to pay some of the costs of wildfire damages in 2017 and possibly the Camp Fire also, but that additional costs could be passed on to utility ratepayers through bonds to pay damages from the fires.In the filing Tuesday, the company said that about 15 minutes after the 115,000-volt line lost power, a PG&E employee noticed a ""fire in the vicinity"" of the tower holding up that portion of the line.A subsequent inspection by the utility found a broken hook that had held an insulator connected to the line, the company said Tuesday. PG&E employees noticed a flash mark on the tower. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection later determined the fire's initial coordinates were near the damaged tower.PG&E also disclosed that a second, smaller power line experienced an outage at 6:45 a.m. on Nov. 8. Later inspection found a wooden pole with bullets and bullet holes near its breaking point, the company said. Several trees had also fallen in the area, and some had fallen on top of the wires.",-0.9959

1061,"PG&E Stock Now Has a Better Outlook, Say Analysts -- Barrons.com10:48 am ET February 26, 2019 (Dow Jones) PrintBy Alexandra ScaggsPG&E (ticker: PCG) has been upgraded to Hold from Sell by analysts at Argus in a Tuesday note. The outlook for the stock is brightening, they say, as California officials seem increasingly willing to work with PGE to manage its liabilities as the utility goes through bankruptcy.The back story. PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Jan. 29 as the potential size of its wildfire liabilities grew. The utility first said it could owe up to $30 billion to victims of the deadly wildfires that tore across California in 2017 and 2018. The state's "" inverse condemnation"" laws didn't help.Since then PG&E has been cleared of liability from the Tubbs Fire, one of the most expensive fires of the past two years. That reduced its wildfire liabilities to around $20 billion, CreditSights analysts wrote. Yet its shares trade at just 4.4 times this year's forecasted earnings, Argus says, far below the utility sector's 19.6 times price/earnings multiple. Even peers in California trade at higher valuations: Edison International (EIX) shares trade at a 13.6 times P/E multiple.What's new. PG&E's chances for legislative relief have improved since it has filed for bankruptcy, changed its CEO and decided to revamp its board, Argus writes. Most recently, PG&E told employees that they would not receive $130 million in bonuses this year after fire victims objected to the bonuses.State officials do seem more willing to work with the utility to manage its bankruptcy process. California Governor Gavin Newsom indicated he might support changing the way utilities pay for wildfire liabilities, Argus writes, because wildfires have become so much more common. But it isn't clear that lawmakers are willing to change the state's inverse condemnation laws.Looking ahead. The worst may be over for the company, Argus writes, especially because PG&E stock trades at such a low valuation compared with peers. The firm also writes that the dividend could be reinstated by 2020. But there is still a lot of risk in trading this stock, and the next move in PG&E's shares will likely depend on lawmakers' mood, not the outlook for the utility's business.""Our risk-reward analysis indicates potential further downside of 10%, but potential upside of 25% depending on the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings,"" Argus writes.

1071,"PG&E Pays Over $268 Million in Property Taxes to 50 California CountiesSAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- For the second half of 2020, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E(PCG)) paid property taxes of over $268 million to the 50 counties where it owns properties that support gas and electric service to 16 million Californians. “Property tax payments are one of the important ways PG&E(PCG) helps drive local economies and supports essential public services like education and public safety. This year’s payments reflect the substantial local investments we continue to make in our gas and electric infrastructure to create a safer and more reliable system and to better mitigate against wildfires,” said David Thomason, Vice President, Controller and Chief Financial Officer for PG&E(PCG). PG&E’s payments of more than $268 million covers the period from July 1 to December 31, 2020. Total payments for the tax year of July 1, 2020, to, June 30, 2021, are more than $537 million — an increase of nearly $28 million, or 5.5 percent, compared with the prior tax year. The increase in property tax payments reflect PG&E’s continuing investments to enhance and upgrade its gas and electrical infrastructure for safety, reliability and wildfire mitigation across Northern and Central California. PG&E (PCG) supports the communities it serves in a variety of ways. Last year, PG&E(PCG) provided $17.5 million in community grants and investments to enhance local educational opportunities, preserve the environment, and support economic vitality and emergency preparedness. PG&E(PCG) employees provide volunteer service in their local communities. The company also offers a broad spectrum of economic development services to help local businesses grow",0.9956

A, Initial Br. of the CPUC,Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Dkt. No. ER16-2320-002 (Mar. 15, 2018) at 8.)

Investigators also said they found evidence PG&E violated state law.Prosecutors say a judge could use those facts to determine that the utility violated conditions of its probation in a conviction stemming from an explosion of one of its natural gas lines in 2010.

They simply passed the costs to customers back in 2001. No other utility is willing to buy PG&E and own up to the risks. Hedge funds are the only ones and California doesn't want that, so they're practically begging Warren Buffett to buy PG&E. If there are no real bidders, they either let PG&E continue business by increasing costs to customers, or they have to bail it out. Rolling blackouts will lead to riots and politicians KNOW this. Rain is coming in less than 2 weeks. By Thanksgiving, I expect to see $10-$20 on the stock price. A judge forced previous bankruptcy victims into mediation, which means LESS cost to PG&E because he knows PG&E can't just black out. With the new fires barely causing any damage, we'll see double digits soon. Last night, they said the burn line hit the old Tubbs burn, which was the deadliest fire in California history before the Camp fire one in Paradise, CA. And the Tubbs fire only cost $1.3 billion, with over 5,500+ structures burned. Mathematically, with only 200+ structures burned and 30% containment and no winds (with major roads on either side of the fire to help transport firefighters in and out of the area of battle - MAJOR advantage), with 400 structures burned, the math works out to $50-$100 million or so.

1276,"So I did some of my own research on this instead of just listening to all the crazy talk on here and this is what I conclude. All of you shorts hoping it goes to zero, you will be disappointing, at least until every thing is settled, and I mean everything, even the bankruptcy, and that will be a while, several months. Here is the truth, if there truly is a 75% chance of zero and only 25% chance of somewhere between $20 and $25 that puts the price target somewhere between $5 and $6.25 a share (25% of $20 = $5.00; to 25% of $25 = $6.25), not zero and that is assuming there truly is only a 25% likelihood that the PG&E bankruptcy plan or something similar gets approved which would give the shareholders about $20 to $25 per share in the end. The bondholder's plan would give shareholders essentially zero. The court did not say they are accepting the bondholders plan completely and totally rejecting PG&E's plan. In my opinion, I bet in the end the answer lies somewhere in between zero and the $25 to $26 range, maybe somewhere in the $10 to $15 range, maybe only $5 to $10 range, no one knows yet, but I personally do not think the end result will be zero to the shareholders, not in this case. Also, I can say with near certainty that unless and until we know what bankruptcy plan will be approved and what the shareholder will ultimately get out of it, on the 25% chance that the stock could be worth $20 to $25 in the end it will most definitely not go to zero. Think about it, if you could buy a raffle ticket that had a 25% chance of winning somewhere between $20 and $25, wouldn't that be worth something? Wouldn't you think a rational person would pay about $5 to $6.25 for it? They would, because that is what it is worth. So stop it with all the doom and gloom, there is still some value here. The fire will be put out, it will blow over, it's bad, but so far (cross finger, pray) no body has died yet.",0.9794

Local governments have a long history of selling off municipal utilities, switching them from the public sector to the private. Witness the ongoing efforts to privatize Puerto Rico’s troubled power authority.But with PG&E planning to file for bankruptcy this month -- the result of mounting wildfire liabilities that could reach $30 billion -- a government takeover has become a real possibility. In fact, the future of the power giant that has long reigned over a broad swath of California could very well involve a complete dismantling of its system and a takeover by multiple municipalities.PG&E’s own hometown of San Francisco has signaled interest in buying some of the company’s assets. The city’s utilities commission said Tuesday that Mayor London Breed asked it to study the possibility.The commission, which pipes water from the Sierra Nevada mountains to the city and runs its own hydroelectric dams, has had a testy relationship with PG&E. Seizing the company’s local assets has, for years, been a lodestar goal of the city’s political left.“I think, as a city, this is an unparalleled opportunity to move to energy independence, to independence from Pacific Gas and Electric,” Aaron Peskin, a member of the San Francisco board of supervisors, said at a hearing related to the matter Tuesday.More to follow",0.9921

REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage(Reuters) - S&P cut its rating on PG&E Corp's (PCG.N) Pacific Gas & Electric Co unit on Wednesday, making it the third such cut this month, after the unit missed interest payments on its 2040 senior notes.The credit rating agency downgraded the unit's rating to 'D' from 'CC' after Pacific Gas and Electric failed to make the $21.6 million interest payment due on Tuesday, as the company planned to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.The latest cut comes two days after both Fitch and S&P downgraded PG&E and its Pacific Power & Gas Co unit in the face of massive claims stemming from deadly wildfires.PG&E, which provides electricity and natural gas to 16 million customers in northern and central California, faces widespread litigation, government investigations and liabilities that could potentially exceed $30 billion because of the fires.The most recent fire last November killed at least 86 people in the deadliest and most destructive blaze in California history.San Francisco-based PG&E is working on lining up roughly $5.5 billion in so-called debtor-in-possession financing to help operations during bankruptcy proceedings.(Reporting by Aakash Jagadeesh Babu in Bengaluru; Editing by Tom Brown and Peter Cooney)",0.903

The 2015 Ghost Ship fire and the 2017 Tubbs fire are also covered, although the utility doesn’t admit fault for either blaze, PG&E said......The utility said it had also received more than $12 billion in equity backstop commitments to support the settlement and its plan of reorganization.....If approved, the settlement means PG&E will avert a trial scheduled to begin next month in San Francisco federal court to determine its liability from fire-related losses and estimate damages.“What makes the settlement significant is it creates a pathway to confirm a plan where you don’t have to go through extensive litigation,” said Eric Goodman, an attorney with the official committee representing wildfire victims.The cases of a group of victims of the Tubbs fire who were elderly or sick will remain scheduled for trial in January, attorney Mike Danko said. Such cases can’t be delayed more than 15 days, he said, adding that they could still be settled ahead of trial as part of the $13.5 billion deal. Danko represents fire victims but not those scheduled for trial next month.""-It sounds like this settlement covers all fires, possibly including the Tubbs fire, which CalFire already determined PG&E wasn't at fault, and possibly could mean no trial.

1347,"From a well written piece on Seeking AlphaThis is not a business that has shown its ability to pay off billions of dollars of settlements and potentially tens of billions of capex needed to meet California's whims given enough time. FERC has ruled against PCG's ability to renege or renegotiate power contracts through the bankruptcy process. PCG may have some room to improve cash flow by raising customer rates, but BlueMountain would have to show that its New Slate BOD would be more capable at navigating through those regulatory hurdles than the current regime, which for whatever shortcomings they have, do have years of that very specific Californian utility experience.Furthermore, even if PCG was able to deal with its liabilities outside of bankruptcy court, the investability of this business is virtually nil. Wildfires happened in 2017 and 2018 and with global warming, this issue is not going to go away any time soon. With potentially unlimited liability until every single tree near a power line is cut down, who would want to take on this kind of responsibility? Why would anyone want to invest in a stock like this? With potentially unlimited liabilities into perpetuity and utility like ROI, this stock should be trading at lower earnings multiples than video rental stores or newsprint telephone directories. The State of California is going to have to eventually take this company over and my guess would be once it does, the scenario by which it does it will completely wipe out any equity holders.",0.9884

With that said the 10 dollar range seems to me represents the bottom. They won't let this drop lower as it defeats the whole purpose. I mean come on, we all know this company is worth a lot more than the measly $5B market cap. The underwriters and the funds who will be purchasing these shares know this. They must be eyeing $30 - $40B valuations otherwise none of this makes any sense. That would put the share price at $15-$20.

But PG&E's liability burden is still in flux, and the company hasn't decided on exactly how it will raise the money, according to papers filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco.PG&E said last week ""that we cannot finalize our plan until the estimation of liabilities is resolved through the courts."" The chapter 11 plan, PG&E's opening gambit in what is expected to be a tough negotiation, offers nearly $18 billion to wildfire victims, insurance companies that have paid fire claims and cities and other public entities that battled the blazes in 2017 and 2018.",-0.9552

Two other Third Point funds dropped by roughly the same amount. The 11% annual losses for those funds were disclosed in the same document.Third Point, run by Chief Executive Daniel Loeb, is one of the most prominent hedge funds in the industry.

These donations come from shareholder funds, not customers.PG&E ( PCG has delivered 20,000 N95 masks and 20,000 surgical masks directly to the Kaiser Permanente Livermore receiving center. Kaiser has an immediate and critical need for the protective masks for its medical professionals.“As a company and as individuals, we recognize the need to support the medical community and all they’re doing to help safeguard the health and safety of our fellow Californians. This crisis is unprecedented, but we know that our path forward requires us working together and helping medical professionals and first responders on the front lines of the pandemic. Helping our state and local communities is part of who we are at PG&E ( PCG It’s the right thing to do,” said Andy Vesey, PG&E ( PCG CEO and President.Vesey said the donations mirror the mutual aid that utility companies provide to each other during emergency response for storms, earthquakes or fires. The company maintains a supply of several types of masks to protect utility crews working in construction zones or responding to wildfires. Each year before wildfire season the company replenishes its stock of masks. PG&E ( PCG ) is donating as many masks as possible to Cal OES, while maintaining sufficient supplies to ensure the safety of our field workers performing essential and emergency services during this time of the COVID-19 pandemic and to prepare for the upcoming fire season. The company will continue to evaluate opportunities for additional donations of masks and other equipment.PG&E ( PCG employees also are collecting masks and other equipment from their personal emergency kits to donate to hospitals and emergency services responders in their local areas.Charitable Contribution to Local NonprofitsAdditionally, PG&E ( PCG and The PG&E Corporation Foundation will contribute a combined $1 million in charitable contributions to support PG&E ( PCG customers and their communities, focused on vulnerable customers and underserved communities experiencing hardship due to quarantine, illness, caring for loved ones, or school/business closures.“In addition to providing safe and reliable energy service to our customers every day, we’re dedicated to supporting our communities during times of crisis. We know that many of our customers may face uncertainty and financial instability due to school and childcare closures, job loss, and other economic impacts. That’s why we’re working with our nonprofit partners to help with immediate needs,” said Robert Kenney, Chairman of The PG&E Corporation Foundation.The contributions will be directed to nonprofits supporting people experiencing food insecurity, small businesses, as well as regional community foundations’ COVID 19 relief funds, food banks, senior meal programs and others.PG&E ( PCG ) is also encouraging its employees who want to give to contribute to charitable organizations providing support to impacted local communities.

That means at the very least a lot of shenanigans like ad targeting and possible trackers.Never make any decision about the stock market based on what anyone on this board is posting. Period. That's important. You really don't know who they are and more importantly you don't know who they work for. You can easily see the sense of euphoria or rueful regret. So PCG just announced an 800 million share shelf offering. These shares are owned by stock holders who want to sell their stock!? I'm to inexperienced to have ever heard of such a thing. My best guess is they are in for a play. In other words they won't be able to maximize their shares for profit and you the long shareholder may experience some angst.Finally, let me reiterate a rather startling occurrence as to the the PCG July 31st $11 calls. There were OVER 180,000 call contracts at one point! Now there are 67,049. ZERO puts. That is truly remarkable in an of itself. To what end? It didn't take long to go from billions shares dilution to Euphoria to an 800 million shelf offering and a $9 share lockdown.So these events should convince you that at the very least there are very big, powerful forces at play. You don't play in the minor leagues if you can pull that option stunt that just occurred!!! Wow. That being said, I own shares and I am very long.

(PCG) shares continued to fall Wednesday as prospects dimmed that California politicians would step in to help the embattled utility avoid a bankruptcy filing.Analysts said the continued plunge reflected mounting concerns among investors that California Gov. Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers won't offer the company an alternative to bankruptcy in the near term. Public opposition to PG&E(PCG) has grown in recent months, complicating a state rescue.""Investors are starting to realize this is going to be quite a protracted process to figure out a solution that works for all constituents,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Stephen Byrd.PG&E (PCG) declined to comment.The company's share price has been falling since mid-November, when the Camp Fire, the deadliest wildfire in California history, killed 86 people and destroyed about 14,000 homes in the northern part of the state. PG&E's(PCG) market value was below $3.6 billion as of midday Wednesday, down from about $24 billion at the end of October.Both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Utility Average will replace PG&E(PCG) in their indexes on Friday.State fire investigators haven't yet determined whether PG&E(PCG) equipment helped start the Camp Fire, but the company has disclosed that some of its equipment malfunctioned in the area shortly before the fire started. Investigators previously tied PG&E(PCG) equipment to at least 17 major fires in 2017.In a securities filing Monday, PG&E(PCG) called a bankruptcy filing its ""only viable option,"" citing more than $30 billion in potential wildfire-related liability costs. It said it faced about 50 lawsuits related to the Camp Fire and more than 700 lawsuits in connection with 2017 fires.Rob Rains, an analyst with Washington Analysis LLC, wrote in a note that the company's intent to file for bankruptcy protection and subsequent statements from California officials imply ""that a rescue mission by elected leaders may not be forthcoming, forecasting a potentially contentious bankruptcy proceeding.""California lawmakers last year passed legislation that provides a path for PG&E(PCG) to securitize some of its wildfire- related liabilities from 2017 wildfires and pass those costs on to ratepayers. But the law didn't explicitly address fires in 2018, and lawmakers this week indicated there were no efforts under way to expand the law.State Assemblyman Chris Holden, who had been expected to introduce legislation to extend the law to include 2018, has since paused the effort.""To the extent that the courts can help them restructure and put them in a different position, I think that's obviously the choice they've made,"" Mr. Holden said.Mr. Newsom, who took office as governor this month, has stated his desire to protect the interests of the state as well as fire victims and PG&E(PCG) customers as the company heads to bankruptcy court.

Regulators are pretty dumb to try to close this clean,carbon-free reliable source of energy now.Battle Brewing About California’s Role in Diablo Canyon Nuclear Plant RetirementAn assortment of entities have sought to intervene in a complaint alleging that the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) and California state agencies violated bulk power system reliability standards when they approved retirement of the 2,240-MW Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) by 2025. Before the comment deadline on Nov. 16, at least 15 entities sought intervention in the Oct. 26 complaint filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) by nonprofit nuclear advocacy group Californians for Green Nuclear Power Inc. (CGNP) over regulatory approvals of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PG&E’s) voluntary plan to permanently shutter the nuclear plant near Avila Beach, California. Intervenors include nuclear advocacy organizations, trade groups, power companies, and environmental and citizen groups.A Dispute About Resources and ReliabilityPG&E announced it would shutter the 1,138-MWe Unit 1 and the 1,151-MWe Unit 2, both Westinghouse pressurized water reactor units, in June 2016, upon the expiration of the reactors’ operating licenses—November 2024 for Unit 1 and August 2025 for Unit 2. The utility reached the decision after reaching a “joint proposal” with labor and environmental groups that sought to increase investment in energy efficiency, energy storage, and renewables beyond the state’s 2015 mandates to source 50% of its power from renewables, while also phasing out nuclear power in California by 2025. While the CPUC approved PG&E’s application to shutter the plant in January 2018, an initiative to replace the plant’s power with zero-carbon options was enshrined in state law by California’s former Gov. Jerry Brown in September 2018. But in its complaint (Docket No. EL21-13-000), CGNP claims CAISO, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), the California State Water Resources Control Board (CSWRCB), and California State Lands Commission (CSLC) violated the North American Reliability Corp.’s (NERC’s) bulk power system standards when the CPUC approved PG&E’s plan to close the two-unit plant by 2025 “without first properly analyzing the adverse bulk electric system and adverse bulk natural gas system consequences, in light of known California-specific hazards, including those caused by seismic activity and the Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) policies enacted by” the CPUC. The complaint also alleges NERC and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) “failed to conduct proper oversight or enforced NERC’s reliability standards,” which “will be violated” by removing Diablo Canyon’s 2,240 MW from California’s grid. “Recent events, including the August 2020 blackouts that affected millions of California utility customers, point to the underlying reliability issue facing California’s electric grid, even with DCPP continuing to operate,” it says. “The premature closure of DCPP will only exacerbate current reliability issues, and is inconsistent with federal law.”",0.9982

1669,"If it's too hard to comprehend, I'll make it short and simple. The share price highs were in the $70s before all the fires. Stock valuation is based on EPS, or earnings per share. It's not based on the current share price. Utilities are not like other industries where a replacement product can just take over. It's also almost a certainty PG&E will increase rates, thereby increasing revenue and EPS. Even if common shares are diluted more than 100%, that still puts the future share price value based on EPS to be in the $30s. In the end, it only matters when dilution occurs. If the dilution happens at $10, the share price is still worth about $20. If enough buying pushes the price to $20 and THEN the dilution happens, that means they'd need 50% less shares to dilute, meaning the share price value increases even more. So timing is key.For those who keep asking wouldn't dilution cause a sell-off? Again, EPS. Learn about it. The share price has already tanked 95% from the highs to the lows on the worst case scenarios. Nowhere else to go but up.Now if PG&E was smart, they'd announce that they'll spend tens of billions to bury their power lines. That'll reduce future risks and increase the share price even more from risks averted.",0.9826

The measures the judge has proposed would be part of the utility's probation. And since they falsified reports submitted to the court, constitutes a clear violation of that probation, it is not expected to go well for PGE in Alsup's court.",0.9894

1712,"There are 3 issues here: 1) how to finance the past wildfire costs. Elliott’s proposal involves paying off wildfire debts with equity, while the company and its shareholders would rely more heavily on debt financing. 2) corporate control. The State needs to know that if PG&E is going to continue to kill people and destroy property, that it can wrest control from the firm and either break it for individual counties to manage and/or make it state-owned, and 3) reputation. Newsom cannot watch PG&E declare BK again and fail under his watch. The answer is simple: as to #1, dilute current shareholders more to reduce debt load. So, if Citi analysts thinks the stock is worth $10.50, think $5.25. This is a middle ground between the Elliott plan of $0 and the $10.50 Citi valuation (which seems fair based on book value of pre- Sept 2018 and now). #2, PG&E has to be willing to lose it all if it continues to place profits before people and planet. PG&E will lose it all if they don't agree, so PG&E better change out the board and be ready to hand the keys over the State, and #3, Newsome needs these concessions to preserve any credibility properly managing the State and showing is not owned by Corporations or hedge funds. If PG&E insists on its current planned capital structure, the stock will go to $0. If PG&E negotiates like they did with the wildfire victims after the Elliott plan was announced, the stock will go to $5.25. New research puts the service outages at 2x to 4x the duration as this year's, so pressure will continue to build for a State takeover. If PG&E meets Newsom's demands, then my target will likely be $5.25 assuming PG&E agrees to more dilution and less debt. If PG&E will never allow the State to control it or won't clean up the debt issue, then $0.So, today, my price target is $3 as it's a coin toss imo.",-0.1119

That Could Actually Be Good for Current Shareholders. -- Barrons.comBY Dow Jones & Company, Inc.— 11:55 AM ET 04/06/2020News that a company plans to issue new shares is seldom a good thing for current shareholders.But the bankruptcy of California electric utility PG&E ( PCG ) has been unusual the whole way through.The latest strange development is that the company will likely be able to sell shares at a premium to the current market price, according to Mizuho. In other words, buyers of the new shares will have to pay more to get the same ownership stake in the company. Shares were up 7.2% in midmorning trading Monday.""If the equity issuance were to happen under the current market conditions, we would expect PG&E ( PCG ) shares to price at a significant premium to where the stock is trading today,"" wrote Paul Fremont, analyst at Mizuho.That is because of the terms of the agreement that PG&E ( PCG ) struck with other parties in the bankruptcy, including the investors who have agreed to provide backstop financing to the company, along with a group of wildfire victims who are being compensated for their losses in company shares. Under that agreement, the company will sell stock based on its estimated adjusted future income and a predetermined price-to-earnings multiple -- not the company's share price at the time.Fremont estimates that if the company's stock is trading at $8 a share at the time that it sells new stock, it will be able to sell 750 million new shares at an average $14.07 a share. Shares were trading at $8.47 on Monday.The analyst kept his Buy rating on the stock, and raised his price target to $15.50.Over the past month the outlook has brightened considerably for Pacific Gas and Electric and its holding company PG&E ( PCG ). Gov. Gavin Newsom of California filed a letter on March 20 that said the utility's current reorganization plan meets requirements that the state legislature imposed as prerequisites for the company's exit from bankruptcy. He also expressed support for a plan to issue up to $7.5 billion in tax-exempt bonds. (Mizuho's calculations assume that the company issues $7 billion in bonds.)The company has some leeway in the timing of when it can sell that new stock.

1747,"Why PG&E’s restructuring plan and reviving their stock value may help fuel $BE stock price! PG&E’s stock is jumping today ( stock up today > 17%) based on its proposed settlement with the California fire victims..as a major part of PG&E’s restructuring plan ( there are Billions $ of their equity and board’s fiduciary duty at stake here) is to avoid another major wild fire at any cost. PG&E officially stated that moving forward they would be shutting down the power even more frequently, as a precaution against high wind or dry conditions risking another such fire. So unfortunately more sad news for Californian businesses and residents ... but it doesn’t have to be, thanks to Bloom Energy and it’s micro grid solution.I don’t expect California’s critical infrastructure like hospitals, stores, schools, offices, data centers, factories and even homes wanting to go back to 18th century living in darkness and without water ( and toilet)..risking lives and business revenues !! ( note: if you are living in those areas affected by the PG&E wild fires - my sincere sympathies..please do comment how you feel about the power cuts..)Given that another major fire incident will be a kiss of death for $PCG stock value and for its management — $BE’s fuel cell power generation is ripe for an immediate and sustainable solution to power this critical infrastructure (locally using micro grids). The Bloom Energy fuel cell micro grid power generation solution is much cheaper, safer and cleaner than installing traditional generating sets ( with traditional generators and turbines - mechanical efficiency is much lower, and green house gas and particles emissions are much higher polluting communities near the traditional these generating sites..and by the way not everyone can afford and maintain a generator ...thankfully no such issues near Bloom’s fuel cell sites and existing local grid infrastructure can be used to distribute the power to everyone ).Solar and Wind power may have an important role to play but these are a part of the solution with $BE fuel cell generation ( powered by natural gas or methane generated from community or farm waste sites) ..Solar and Wind power sources can’t work alone all by themselves.. solar and wind source intensity changes daily and seasonably, requiring a Battery to store their power or to pump back the power in a grid..There is no such Battery of that size in the world today and not expected at least for the next 5-10 years - to power this critical infrastructure for its peak load and its average load for hours and days!!! ...the largest battery for such utility use is made by Tesla and it is only used to balance peak loads for just seconds of the peak power loads variation !In conclusion, I expect a huge order for $BE fuel cells in 2020 & beyond from California and many other states across the US ( and for that matter whole micro grid sector as a whole is expected to go up!) .. As Utilities and their boards wake up to these expensive risks ( such as PG&E did , and it is just a start) , and State & Local Politicians better understand that they will be voted out of “power” if their voting residents are “out of power” ( as NY legislators recently allowed propane pipeline for Long Island) — $BE investors and clients will be handsomely rewarded !!

PG&E CEO To Retire, Utility’s Wildfire-Linked Bankruptcy Nears Its ClosePalo Alto Daily News (CA)Apr. 22--PG&E Chief Executive Officer William ""Bill"" Johnson will retire on June 30, the target date for the company to emerge from a $51.69 billion bankruptcy linked to the series of catastrophic wildfires caused by the disgraced utility.Johnson came on board PG&E about a year ago, taking on the role of chief executive officer and president of the PG&E parent company that owns utility operator Pacific Gas and Electric.""I joined PG&E to help get the company out of bankruptcy and stabilize operations,"" Johnson said Wednesday in a prepared release. ""By the end of June, I expect that both of these goals will have been met.""PG&E filed for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2019 in a quest to reorganize its shattered finances, which had buckled beneath a rising mountain of debts and wildfire-linked liabilities.The company's equipment caused lethal wildfires in 2015 in Amador County and Calaveras County, in 2017 in the North Bay Wine Country and nearby regions, and in 2018 in Butte County.Johnson will be succeeded by interim CEO William ""Bill"" Smith, a member of PG&E's board and a retired president of AT&T Technology Operations and AT&T Services.PG&E must emerge from bankruptcy by June 30 or it won't be able to qualify for a wildfire insurance fund established by state legislation. If PG&E can't take money from that fund, its financial structure won't be viable.The powerful state Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to make a decision on PG&E's plan to extricate itself from bankruptcy on May 21.U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali, who has shepherded PG&E's bankruptcy case through the court, also must approve the company's plan.The plan, hammered out after extensive negotiations with an often critical Gov. Gavin Newsom as well as the PUC, includes new controls designed to prevent repeats of the company's blunders that have triggered fatal infernos, crippling blackouts, and sky-high electricity bills.On May 26, PG&E is scheduled to plead guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter for the 2018 fatal inferno that scorched Butte County and destroyed the town of Paradise. On May 27, the bankruptcy court is scheduled to confirm the bankruptcy plan.Among the major concerns that linger: PG&E is expected to emerge from bankruptcy while burdened with $35 billion in debts.Johnson is a former CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority.""We were fortunate to have Bill Johnson's experience and steady presence for the past year as he shepherded the company through multiple challenges,"" said Nora Mead Brownell, chair of PG&E's board of directors.",-0.6867

In a state court filing Tuesday, the utility said it has accepted regulators’ conclusions that the fire was caused by PG&E’s equipment but will contest the 25 counts that have never been applied to a wildfire.PG&E said in a statement that its thoughts are with those who lost homes and businesses in the fire, and especially injured firefighters. The filing outlines “why we believe the majority of these charges should be dismissed.”While California health and safety codes make it a crime to emit air contaminants, those laws govern pollution-generating industries such as oil refineries, factories and dumps, PG&E said in the filing. They don’t apply to companies that may cause a wildfire and, as a byproduct, “cause contaminants to be emitted into the air from the property of third parties.”",-0.9072

His spokesman, Nathan Click, says Newsom's staff was briefed by PG&E officials on its proposed board changes in recent days.The San Francisco-based utility is in the midst of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings after it said it could not afford billions of dollars in liability related to deadly wildfires.Newsom says putting hedge fund managers in charge of the company will send a message the utility prioritizes profits over providing safe and reliable energy service.",0.6709

N if they must give up their rights and property to participate said fund, other companies will also have to pony up similar offers. Victims should accept the current offer, because if they don’t, everyone will just go back into court until pcg gets liquidated. Which means, more attorney fees and the case can drag on for years. Which also means victims won’t get paid as much and probably won’t get paid til years down the road when everything is settled. N I saw that PCG other preferred stocks are worth/assigned a value of $25. So the issued stocks to victims should be about $25 as well. Which isn’t a bad offer because if they get out of bankruptcy they should be between mid 20-30ish per share (I think some people here estimate them to be around $35 per share) meaning they’ll get paid more than 13.5 B when it’s all said n done. Probably more towards 16 B if we take the mid $30ish calculations (which I think is more than reasonable if they can tap the wild fire fund since it means they should be going back to bankruptcy anytime soon which add stability to their value).Lastly I read that other Californian’s residents just received letters from the other two big companies that their expected increases on electricity city bill is around 15% to fight future fire.

Municipal bonds paid back over time by ratepayers would finance the transaction.“PG&E operates a monopoly as a privilege granted by the state of California, and that privilege can be revoked,” Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat, said in an interview. “I support public ownership of PG&E.”In a statement, PG&E said it opposes the bill. “Changing the structure of the company would not create a safer or cleaner operation,” the utility said. “We remain focused on fairly resolving wildfire claims and exiting the Chapter 11 process as quickly as possible.”PG&E shares rose 14% Monday in New York after the company outlined plans late Friday to overhaul its board of directors as part of a broad reorganization proposal aimed at winning state approval for its",0.9939

The three-month deadline recently passed and was extended by at least another month so PG&E can make corrections.The CPUC's Public Advocates Office first sounded the alarm in April. The independent watchdog group says that PG&E isn't prioritizing vegetation management and inspections in high-risk areas.""Their response to this overall issue has been like somebody driving a car at night without the headlights on and saying, 'we're perfectly safe, it doesn't matter until the highway patrol pulls us over, then we're unsafe,'"" said Dr. Nathaniel Skinner, Safety Branch Manager with the Public Advocates Office.The Wildfire Safety Division says that PG&E is actually spending less money on clearing vegetation from power lines and other equipment, contradicting claims that they're hiring more people to do the work.Other concerns in the report include quality control and verifying how money spent reduces wildfire risk.""There is still time for corrections to happen and for PG&E to fix its failures, to get people completing the full inspections, to make sure they're spending more money on vegetation management and less on bonuses for executives,"" Skinner said. "" But time is running short.""KRCR reached out to PG&E and was provided the following statement:The most important responsibility that we have as a company is to keep our customers and communities safe. We are working every day to improve our electric system and further reduce wildfire risk around it. We know we have more to do, and we are committed to doing it the right way. We continue to welcome these observations and feedback about our performance because we know this makes us better and safer.While we largely delivered on our 2020 Wildfire Mitigation Plan, we identified several gaps in our execution that we’ve tackled head-on.

1994,"PG&E will file for Chapter 11 but it is likely the proceeding would be changed to Chapter 7 as that is likely to maximize the funds available to creditors. The BK court can recognize state claims as superior to private claims. Although in general all unsecured creditors are treated equally, BK courts have the discretion, and on occasion do, create multiple classes of unsecured creditors. Wages owed employees are protected in bankruptcy to some extent depending on the amount of liability to the employees. Whether 11 or 7, it likely that current shareholders would be wiped out as they have only a residual claim after all other claimants have been fully satisfied (the GM bankruptcy is an example of this).

2017,"On Monday, three major California utilities proposed new charges and a reduction in a key benefit for solar customers. PG&E (PCG), Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric asked the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to allow them to charge customers who have solar panels monthly fees: both a flat charge and a ""grid access"" charge per kilowatt. For the average 5 kilowatt system on a California home, the grid access charge could rise to more than $50 a month, and the flat monthly fees would range from $12.02 to $24.10 depending on the utility.The grid access fee alone could completely eliminate the cost benefit of solar, Morgan Stanley analyst Stephen Byrd notes, after reviewing a presentation from Sunrun that estimates the pricing for a customer in Southern California. While a bill from a traditional utility would be $258 a month, Sunrun's solar and battery storage system would cost the same customer $200, the Sunrun presentation says. About 40% of Sunrun's customers are in California.And that's not all. The utilities want to reduce the fees from a system known as net metering that pays solar users for power they send back to the grid during the day. A reduction in that fee would also hurt the economics of solar, and make it harder to convince customers to switch from traditional utilities. The new net metering rules would be imposed on new customers, not existing ones.The solar industry and supporters have pushed back, with the Save California Solar Coalition saying that if the utilities ""are successful, they would essentially eliminate the market in California just like they did in Nevada a few years ago."" In 2015, Nevada reduced payments for net metering, causing installations to drop precipitously. The state legislature restored the payments in 2017.The tough line being taken by the utilities may foreshadow similar fights from other utilities across the country that want people who own solar panels to pay them more money for basic grid services. Utilities have argued that it is complicated to integrate new forms of energy into the grid, and that solar owners don't pay enough for the upgrades to infrastructure -- forcing other utility customers to pay more.So far, these are just proposals, and solar operators have also presented their own plans. As Byrd notes, ""prior efforts from California utilities to impose material grid access fees have been rejected by the CPUC.""The commission is expected to decide later this year.",0.9958

The San Francisco Business Times broke the news in February 2018 that PG&E was considering changes at its 1.7 million-square-foot San Francisco headquarters, including a partial lease to other tenants or a sale-and-leaseback. The utility reportedly owns 215-245 Market St. and 77 Beale St.A sale of PG&E’s headquarters building and search for a new home is now an option under consideration to avoid a bankruptcy filing, National Public Radio reported late Friday, citing a senior PG&E official and a former employee with knowledge of the plan that includes a possible sale of the company’s gas operations.Moving its headquarters out of San Francisco could resolve another issue. It would allow the utility giant, with revenue of more than $17 billion in 2017, to avoid the city’s new tax on big businesses to pay for homeless services.

After accounting for future share dilution, PCG trades at a 60% discount to peers; and while we do think a discount is appropriate, given wildfire and reputational risks, we think expectations are too pessimistic. PCG recently emerged from a long-winded bankruptcy and now looks to reimagine itself with new management and further commitments to governance and safety. We see full revenue decoupling in California helping to stabilize revenues during Covid-19, and we also see decreased financial risk as PCG can now participate in the $21 billion state-funded wildfire fund.Risks to our recommendation and target price include worse-than-anticipated California wildfires, a prolonged extension of Covid-19 restrictions, and the inability of new management to capitalize on governance and safety precautions.Our 12-month target price of $14 applies a 13.0x multiple on our 2021 EPS estimate, a 20% discount to peers.

Reason is simply, most calculations now are base on current stock price and all news are saying that the stocks price can flexuate. Meaning most analysis and news reporting are counting on current stocks don’t get wiped out. Secondly it’s not in PG&E best interest to wipe out current stock. Granted it would make their life a whole lot easier, but imagine if you are the victims and see that the current shares get wiped out, what’s protecting their new issued shared from getting wiped out next year or the year later when there’s another wild fire? So to install confidence to both victims and investors and for their plan to work, it’s in my opinion that wiping out current share holders is probably the best course of action. In fact if they do that, that’ll most likely cause all the victims to say no to their plan",0.9955

The report was not made public. It was sent to Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey.Ramsey said in a statement that he and the California Attorney General's office have been investigating PG&E's role in the fire since November. He called the release of the report symbolic because it has been long known that PG&E's equipment caused the fire.He said determining whether a crime occurred is still an ongoing investigation and declined to comment on the status of the probe.Ramsey considered criminally charging PG&E because its equipment caused three wildfires in close succession in October 2017.Cal Fire's investigators found evidence that PG&E violated a tree-trimming law requiring adequate clearance between trees and power lines. Ramsey said he could have charged PG&E with misdemeanors with a maximum fine of $1,000. Instead, he didn't file criminal charges in exchange for PG&E paying $1.5 million to fund a fire-prevention program in Butte County.___3:50 p.m.An attorney representing 2,000 victims of a Northern California wildfire that killed 85 people says the handling of findings by investigators about the cause of the blaze indicates that Pacific Gas & Electric may have broken the law.Cal Fire reported Wednesday that equipment owned and operated by PG&E sparked the Nov. 8 blaze that nearly decimated the town of Paradise.The report was not released to the public, so further details about its content were unavailable.Victims' attorney Mike Danko said Cal Fire will normally release its reports publicly if it finds no laws were broken.He said the agency referred its report to the Butte County district attorney's office, suggesting Cal Fire likely has evidence that the utility was negligent on safety issues.A call seeking comment from Butte County prosecutors was not immediately returned. A PG&E representative did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.___3:35 p.m.Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s chief executive told California lawmakers that he expected the utility would be blamed, but he was still disappointed that the company he heads caused the state's most destructive wildfire last year.CEO Bill Johnson was testifying before the California Assembly's Utilities and Energy Committee when state fire authorities made their announcement. The committee was conducting an oversight hearing on PG&E's management.Johnson took over PG&E on May 1 after former CEO Geisha Williams stepped down and the utility replaced half of its 20-member board of directors.___3:10 p.m.Paradise Mayor Jody Jones says she is not surprised to hear Pacific Gas & Electric Co. power lines sparked a November blaze that killed 85 people in her town and she hopes the findings help its legal case against the utility.California fire authorities said Wednesday the utility's power lines caused the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in state history.Jones says ""it's nice to have a definite answer"" about the cause of the blaze that decimated the town.Paradise sued PG&E in January seeking damages for the loss of infrastructure, land, property, trees, public and natural resources and lost taxpayer resources.The suit alleges that the Nov. 8 blaze started when electrical infrastructure owned, operated and maintained by PG&E failed, causing a spark that ignited the blaze.The suit also alleges that PG&E had planned to de-energize power lines as a precaution against starting a fire but canceled those plans despite windy conditions.___2:35 p.m.California Gov. Gavin Newsom says bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. shouldn't get an extra six months to reorganize. The utility filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January as it faced tens of billions of dollars in potential costs related to deadly California wildfires.Its reorganization plan is due by the end of May, but the utility has requested an extension until November. In a Wednesday court filing, Newsom said the utility's request continues to show it lacks an urgent focus on improving safety. He's asking the court to instead grant an extension through August. Newsom and lawmakers are working on proposals around utility liability for wildfires that could affect the bankruptcy. California investigators on Wednesday found PG&E power lines were responsible for last year's wildfire that killed 85 peopl",0.8741

It is the product of extensive negotiations, treats all victims fairly, protects customers and employees, and will enable PG&E to emerge from Chapter 11 as a financially sound utility positioned to serve California for the long term.“Today’s filing brings us one step closer to successfully concluding PG&E’s Chapter 11 cases so that the wildfire victims can be compensated as quickly as possible. We appreciate the extensive work by many stakeholders that went into this Plan, in particular the efforts of our state leaders to encourage all parties to work quickly to find common ground,” said CEO and President of PG&E Corporation Bill Johnson.https://www.pgecurrents.com/2019/12/12/pg-remains-on-track-to-achieve-confirmation-of-plan-before-june-30-deadline/",0.9841

Thus, the State should enforce stricter policy on safety and request PCG to invest in underground wire to avoid serious incidents like this in the future as this time it had wiped out the whole city of Paradise. As for those families who had lost their love ones, there is no monetary measurement can replace their casualties...an incentive package will only ease their pain temporarily...yet, it’s a must award for their heart aching, mentally suffering and loss.

He also said he is partiality satisfied with the modified plan that addressed his concerns and continue to engage with PCG to ensure safe and reliable energy for Californians.

2385,"There's no way to spin it guys. Although some sources cite state law doesn't require Newsom's approval, the SEC filing from PG&E states the $13.5 billion agreement with fire victims will automatically terminate:""on or before December 13, 2019, the Governor advises the Debtors that in his sole judgment the Amended Plan and the restructuring transactions provided therein do not comply with AB 1054, provided that such termination cannot occur if the Debtors have modified the Amended Plan in a manner acceptable to the Governor in his sole discretion by the earlier of (i) the commencement of the Bankruptcy Court hearing to approve the RSA and (ii) December 17, 2019.""Per the WSJ:""It is up to [Newsom] to determine whether the plan meets the requirements set forth in legislation that earlier this year established a California wildfire fund to help the state’s largest utilities handle fire-related liability costs. To participate in the fund, PG&E must exit bankruptcy by June 30, 2020, and make a series of changes to its safety practices, among other things.State Sen. Bill Dodd, the author of the wildfire fund legislation, indicated support for Mr. Newsom’s stance Friday.""So while state law may not require Newsom's final say for PG&E to enter/exit bankruptcy, it sounds like it's required for PG&E to join the wildfire fund, which PG&E is hoping is it's saving grace for 2020's fire season. With PG&E's plan, if ANYTHING fails along the way, it'll force them right back into bankruptcy (probably chapter 7 next time), and wipe out shareholders including the 20.9% of shares set aside in a trust fund for fire victims.As someone who rode it from the $3s and traded up to the mid $12s (I'm completely out now btw), I'm going to give my two cents that we'll be seeing $7s soon, which is where the major support is at on the chart levels. The reason is simple. The stock crashed on various bad news, including bondholder's plan that would effectively wipe out shareholders. PG&E's plan would effectively allow the stock price to appreciate back up to the $70s, and then selling off the 20.9% minimum (of total) shares set in a trust fund for fire victims, thus retaining equity & minimizing dilution. But, it also adds about $10 billion MORE debt than before bankruptcy of $24 billion, thus Newsom struck it down.After emerging from BK, a company is supposed to have LESS debt. Plus, Newsom will be defined by these fires/souls lost, so he's fighting to ensure PG&E actually changes. If PG&E doesn't compromise FAST, the BK court may accept bondholder's plan, which will basically wipe out shareholders. Professional analysts put the share price value at around 3 pennies if bondholder's plan succeeds.",0.9878

I just copied and pasted the first three paragraphs.California governor signs 22 wildfire-related billsBY SourceMedia— 11:23 AM ET 10/03/2019California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed 22 wildfire-related bills Wednesday, several of which increase state oversight of Pacific Gas & Electric and other investor-owned utilities.Several of the measures require the utilities to properly maintain their equipment and trim trees around power lines to prevent fires.Investigators found that PG&E ( PCG Loading... ) equipment sparked the 2018 Camp Fire that caused 85 deaths and decimated the town of Paradise. The resulting liabilities helped drive the company to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January.“Given the realities of climate change and extreme weather events, the work is not done, but these bills represent important steps forward on prevention, community resilience, and utility oversight,” Newsom said in a statement.Newsom signed Assembly Bill 1054 in July, establishing a $21 billion wildfire liability fund that involves the issuance of $10.5 billion in bonds.This week’s flurry of laws grew out of the recommendations of a panel of experts Newsom formed to investigate methods of preventing fires and holding utilities accountable. The governor’s so-called strike force released its report in June.One of the measures will make it easier for San Francisco to purchase the PG&E ( PCG Loading... ) electricity distribution assets in the city. The city recently offered PG&E ( PCG Loading... ) $2.5 billion for the assets.Senate Bill 550, authored by Sen. Jerry Hill, D-San Mateo, would alter how California defines a change in control at an electric company so that it would no longer trigger close regulatory scrutiny if a local government tries to buy part of a utility.City leaders were concerned that AB 1054, a bill designed to protect utilities from future fire costs, could hamper the city’s efforts because of the regulatory edicts it included.In addition to creating the fund, AB 1054 requires electric utilities to receive annual safety certifications from the state and would create an advisory board that would make recommendations about wildfire safety to state regulators.Hill’s law would make San Francisco’s potential takeover of PG&E ( PCG ) equipment less cumbersome while protecting ratepayers and utility workers, he said.The bill also ensures that public safety is a major consideration in any merger, acquisition or restructuring at an investor-owned utility, he said.Though PG&E ( PCG",0.9859

As a fire victim, I'm not sure I'd be willing to accept those risks. Add the fact that if they don't exit bankruptcy by middle summer of next year, they can't join that wildfire fund.

2473,"So I've done some number calculations assuming that today is the lock in day and assuming that investors are getting that 16% discount. Anyone else who likes calculations please weight in with your numbers to compare if we are even close to each other. (There is a lot of assumptions here and again just my train of thoughts, not meant for trading purposes, pump or sell and definitely not meant for short term holders). The biggest assumptions is that victims getting their 6.75 billion in full and that account for 22.19% of the company (some say they won't get that value while others say they are getting a discount so I'll just cancel out that noise)If 22.19% of the company is worth 6.75 billions then the company is worth $30.419 billion currently.With some reverse calculations, if investors are allow to buy pcg stocks (3.25 + 1.25 = 4.5 billion) at today's rate plus 16% discount, it'll be 524,182,275 shares. Add that in with current shares we have about 1,053,182,276. Back stop gets 50 million shares if they are not use. Now I think i remember reading something that it accounts for 56% of the company, but i'm not sure if that 56% includes backstop shares or not.But a rough estimate is if back stop isn't included in the 56% holding then there should be 1.88 billion total shares which would make the stock price $16.17 per share.If the 56% does include back stop then that's 1.97 billion total shares which would mean the stock will be worth $15.44 per share.So until we know what the strike price is we are looking at minimum this stock to be worth $15.44 over time. That said if they don't need to raise the rest of $1.25 billion which means less dilutions and less over all shares, the share price will be worth. As i've said this is only my simple calculations and a lot of assumptions base on the information that I have so invest and hold or sell at your own risk. And don't ask me when it'll hit that price, because guessing that would be the same as guess what the next winning numbers for the lottery is and i will not waste time on guessing game.",0.9957

The take over provision kicks in after 5000 structures are destroyed. They want 50% more than the Value of the Utility Assets. What are the Assets worth? If California low bids, they will have their buddies beat the offer. They are using the word Assets and not the net worth of the company. They can also argue that the Assets are worth ten times more than California's offer.

2547,"PG&E Can't Dodge Judge Whose Tolerance for Wildfire Risk Is ZeroJoel RosenblattStanford scholar says jurist ‘acting like a super-regulator’Company’s equipment was linked to 18 fires in 2017 season Investigators Blame California Utility PG&E For 2017 Wine Country FiresPhotographer: Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesA federal judge who’s commanding California utility giant PG&E Corp. not to spark any wildfires in 2019 is either doing his job to rein in a troubled company or he’s assuming the role of a “super regulator.”That’s how experts read the extraordinary measures proposed by U.S. District Judge William Alsup -- including his plan to subject the company to criminal sanctions if it fails to trim tree branches too close to thousands of miles of power lines and to force regional grid outages in high-risk weather conditions.The veteran judge is taking no chances with a utility that’s already been convicted of felonies for safety violations after one of its gas pipelines exploded in a city south of San Francisco and killed eight people in 2010. Alsup says his job is to “protect the public from further wrongs” and “promote the rehabilitation of the offender.”As the overseer of PG&E’s probation, Alsup has warned that the company may face further prosecution from findings that its equipment caused 18 wildfires in 2017 -- although officials haven’t determined the causes of the most destructive and deadliest of the blazes over the last two years, the Tubbs and Camp fires.Why California Wildfires Put Heat on Power Companies: QuickTakePG&E is preparing to file for bankruptcy after the cost of the wildfires left it with potential liabilities of $30 billion or more. A Chapter 11 bankruptcy would freeze lawsuits filed on behalf of thousands of property owners, but it won’t get the company off the hook with Alsup.After the November fire that leveled the town of Paradise and killed 86 people, the company pledged precautions similar to what Alsup is calling for, including more careful vegetation management near its electric equipment.But Alsup’s directive that the company turn off transmission lines on windy days appears to exceed the authority of PG&E’s state regulator, the California Public Utilities Commission, at least as far as high-voltage lines are concerned, said Michael Wara, an energy lawyer and senior research scholar at Stanford University. The CPUC can, however, order PG&E to turn off power for local distribution lines, according to Wara.“He’s acting like a super-regulator,” Wara said. Energy policy makers and regulators are “talking and kind of scratching their heads and saying, ‘Wow, I’ve never seen anything like this.’""Wine Country Fires Put PG&E in Prosecutors’ Crosshairs AgainCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom applauded the judge’s “assertiveness.”“We have a federal judge who’s been active, who’s been very active in this space and he’s been very pointed as it related to safety,” Newsom told reporters Monday. “PG&E, with respect, has not been a trusted player in the past. They have admitted knowingly misleading regulators in the past, very recent past.”PG&E is reviewing Alsup’s orders, company spokesman James Noonan said.“We are committed to complying with all rules and regulations that apply to our work, while working together with our state and community partners and across all sectors and disciplines to develop comprehensive, long-term safety solutions for the future,” Noonan said in an email.Alsup declined to comment.The judge’s hands-on approach isn’t new to companies that have appeared before him. Appointed to the bench in San Francisco in 1999 by President Bill Clinton, he routinely holds “tutorial” sessions in his courtroom to get up to speed in complicated cases of corporate wrongdoing.Alsup learned programming code to help him with intellectual property disputes including Oracle Corp.’s copyright suit against Alphabet Inc.’s Google. To prepare for Waymo’s trade secret-theft trial against Uber Technologies Inc., the judge required the companies to bring hardware to court so that he could understand the LiDar technology at issue in the case, which helps driverless cars see their surroundings.Waymo-Uber Judge Alsup Runs a Tight Ship, Starting at 7:30 A.M.When Alsup suspects criminal behavior, he isn’t shy about referring a civil case to the Justice Department for possible prosecution, as he did with the engineer at the heart of the Waymo-Uber fight.To some legal experts, Alsup’s approach to PG&E is hardly extraordinary because he’s prioritizing safety. Citing PG&E’s history of falsifying inspection reports in his Jan. 9 proposal to put the company under a tighter leash, Alsup said the utility can’t consider the reliability of its service or inconvenience to customers in determining whether it needs to cut power.“Only safe operation will be allowed,” Alsup wrote. The goal, he emphasized, is “to reduce to zero the number of wildfires caused by PG&E in the 2019",0.9975

The scope of this endeavor is huge and will ultimately limit fire risk to a negligible amount. Faster restoration times, faster shut down times in the event of a fire, and a re-working of the grid to limit the size of outages. This is the ‘New PG&E Design standard’. Here is the information in case you have not read abiut Company is on Target as Installation of Stronger Poles, Thicker Power Lines Reach Half-Way Point for 2020Mile-by-mile, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) is transforming its electric system in high fire-threat areas to make it more resilient and resistant to wildfires. Known as system hardening, this work will benefit customers directly in terms of improved reliability and increased safety.The ongoing work will happen every day over the next several years as 7,100 miles of PG&E’s distribution circuits are hardened. That’s nearly the distance from San Francisco to Sydney, Australia. PG&E crews and contractors will remove existing poles and install stronger poles, often made of composite materials. Thin, bare power lines are being are replaced with thicker, insulated lines that are more resistant to weather, wind and broken branches. And, in some locations, the electric infrastructure is being buried underground, completely avoiding issues with wind and trees.""The steps PG&E is taking to address the growing wildfire threat in our state is unlike any effort in the company’s history. While there is no single solution, both immediate actions to minimize wildfire risks today, as well as longer-term efforts to rebuild our electric system for the future are necessary and underway,"" said Matt Pender, PG&E’s director of the Community Wildfire Safety Program. ""We will continue until these hardening upgrades are complete for both the safety and reliability of our customers and communities facing the highest risk of wildfire.""This is heavy construction work that requires extensive advanced planning, customer engagement in various languages and then the use of trucks, cranes and bulldozers to get the job done. Through late July, more than half of the hardening work planned for this year has been completed.That includes: • In Mt. Diablo State Park (in Contra Costa and Alameda counties), PG&E recently completed a project that included more than six miles of overhead hardening work and the replacement of 112 poles. • On a project spanning from Oakland to Orinda (also in Alameda and Contra Costa counties), PG&E successfully replaced 2.8 miles of line and 80 poles. • In Pollock Pines (in El Dorado County), a project is currently underway that will replace 1,025 poles and 38 miles of wire on one circuit. Nearly three miles of power line will be buried underground as part of the overall circuit work. This work will continue throughout the year.In total, through late July, PG&E has hardened 138 miles and remains on track to reinforce infrastructure across 241 miles this year. That follows the 171 miles that were hardened in 2019, which surpassed the company’s target of 150 miles last year.System hardening is just one small slice of the comprehensive work being done as part of PG&E’s Community Wildfire Safety Program, which includes doing more work to keep trees away from power lines, adding high-definition cameras and weather stations to provide more detailed real-time information on conditions and adding microgrids that will be able to provide temporary power when and where needed.",0.9918

PG&E intends to reimburse customers through a shareholder-funded trust, but some groups are skeptical of that strategy.• The securitization stems from the ""stress test"" process, adopted by California lawmakers before PG&E filed for bankruptcy in early 2019, which essentially allows the CPUC to consider a utility's financial position in deciding the amount of wildfire costs it can bear without harming ratepayers.• Dive Insight:• PG&E last year filed an application with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) seeking authority to recover the $7.5 billion in wildfire costs by issuing ratepayer-backed bonds. • According to PG&E, securitizing the costs would allow it to retire $6 billion of debt and accelerate compensation promised to fire victims as part of its bankruptcy reorganization plan. The CPUC decision directs the utility to establish a ""customer credit trust"" to reimburse ratepayers, which shareholders would fund with $1 billion in 2021, $1 billion before March 31, 2024, and nearly $7.6 billion down the line.• That last requirement, however, has drawn concerns from ratepayer advocates. PG&E intends to get the money from certain shareholder-owned tax deductions or net operating losses. But consumer advocate The Utility Reform Network (TURN) has pointed out that the utility's most recent 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission states its ability to tap into those net operating loss carryforwards could be limited — although PG&E does not think it will face that issue.",-0.6784

This 7-Eleven store operates 24 hours a day and supports the fueling needs of both EVs and conventional cars, both options owned and operated by 7-Eleven. PG&E (PCG) is also working with 7-Eleven to install fast chargers at additional locations.“7-Eleven has been around for over 90 years, providing customers with convenient and innovative products and services,” said Ann Scott, Sr. Director of Energy Engineering & Store Planning. “We are always trying to think about new ways to add better service to our customers. With more electric vehicles on the road, installing the fast charging stations was an obvious way to offer convenient charging to customers who need it while also taking strides to reduce our impact on the environment. 7-Eleven prides itself in collaborating with other companies who have the same vision to find mutually beneficial solutions for our customers, our business, and the environment.

It’s been working with carmaker BMW to test whether electric vehicles could provide power when there’s an outage or not enough energy to meet demand.Theoretically, a network of EV batteries could one day provide a backup source of energy for communities called a “virtual power plant.” But first, automakers and utilities will need to see if it’s worth it to work with each other. Then, they’ll need to get their customers on board, too. BMW and PG&E’s partnership is a sort of test run for that.The two companies started working together in 2015. Until now, the pair has mostly focused on increasing the amount of renewable energy used to charge EV batteries. It’s a strategy called “smart-charging” that encourages EV owners to charge their cars during times of the day when there is less electricity demand and more available renewable energy, like solar power. Starting this week, they’re expanding the program, and PG&E customers who drive electric or hybrid BMWs can apply for a 24-month “smart-charging” pilot program and earn cash incentives when they charge their cars during recommended hours.The cars won’t be selling energy back to the grid, but the program could give PG&E some early insight into when and where drivers charge their cars, according to Adam Langton, an energy services manager at BMW of North America. That’ll be key for getting drivers on board for vehicle-to-grid charging.The two companies also said they would begin testing hardware in a lab this year. BMW needs to know how often PG&E might ask drivers to connect to the grid and what toll that might take on the car. PG&E needs to know how much energy a car battery can provide and for how long. They’re also figuring out what additional infrastructure might be needed at someone’s home and across the grid to make all of this happen.PG&E, which is based in San Francisco, serves a territory that’s a fertile testing ground for vehicle-to-grid technology. It’s already home to more than 320,000 electric vehicles. That’s roughly 20 percent of all electric cars in the US, according to the utility. By 2030, 5 million EVs are expected to be on the road in California. (Last year, California became the first state to ban the future sale of internal combustion engines.)",0.9982

The arrangement also allows the SBA subsidiary to continue to market and sublicense access to the towers and structures to additional wireless providers and PG&E will receive a portion of that future revenue. The sale of these licenses, which apply to over 700 towers, is expected to generate $973 million in initial proceeds, subject to customary closing adjustments. PG&E is not selling any transmission towers as part of this transaction.PG&E is also entering into a strategic relationship with SBA, through SBA's wholly owned subsidiary, to sublicense and market equipment at additional attachment locations on up to 28,000 transmission towers across PG&E's extensive network. Through this arrangement, PG&E will receive a portion of future revenues from these sublicensed equipment attachment locations.Overall, PG&E expects the proceeds from this agreement to help further reduce its financing needs and strengthen its financial position while also benefiting customers, who will receive a significant portion of the sale proceeds in the form of lower monthly bills as well as a portion of any future revenues from additional attachment locations.""When we emerged from Chapter 11, we made a commitment to achieve financial stability and bolster our overall financial health and we're delivering on that objective. Strategically selling non-core assets like these is one way we're continuing to follow through on that commitment, reduce our financing needs and strengthen our balance sheet,"" said Chris Foster, PG&E Interim Chief Financial Officer.""This transaction adds a significant portfolio of high quality, exclusive locations to our outstanding existing US macro tower portfolio and SBA expects these assets to generate approximately $39.5 million in Tower Cash Flow in their first full year in our portfolio,"" said Jeff Stoops, President and Chief Executive Officer of SBA Communications. ""As 5G network deployments are now a reality, we are excited to use our vast experience and industry leading position in order to facilitate the future additional use of these assets by wireless service providers for the collective benefit of the wireless industry, PG&E and SBA.

2729,"Some quick technical analysis on $PGC. Charts give us an idea of where all the players are. It's like GPS traffic maps. Do you look at GPS traffic maps and say ""nah, GPS, you're wrong, I'm right"" and go anyways when it projects you'll take longer to go because of traffic? No, you wouldn't. Charts are similar. The only difference is that while charts give us a general idea of where things will go based on where things have been (i.e. where all the buyers/sellers are positions, what they're doing, predicting what they'll do etc.), news triggers future buying/selling, thus news is important in the short term, while charts help us in the medium and longer term. Anyways, here's my technical analysis.Basically, if we were to have a real pullback, it would be down to the low $5s. However, the uptrend is still not broken. The move to $6.30s on day 2 of the rally was an overbought situation where it then pulled back into the mid $5s. So perhaps THAT was the pull back. Currently, the stock is consolidating and selling pressure seems minimal given future events (possibility of full containment, rain coming in a little over a week, wind dying down etc.). The resistance levels are highlighted in yellow, which were the prior supporters. Prior support becomes resistance on a reversal as trapped longs attempt to sell out and new longs jump in. The circled area is the current support if we were to do a pull back, that's where I'd be loading up again or buying calls or whatever.Charts typically show a 50% retrace on downtrends. We saw it in Bitcoin, we see it in regular stocks, clear back to before computers started trading. That's just how it is. So if a stock is $100 and sells off to $50, it'll generally do a ""dead cat bounce"" to $75, which is the 50% retrace level, before selling off again below $50. That's how you know a DOWNTREND is happening. However, if it goes above the 50% level, to say $65 or whatever, there's a REALLY good chance it'll retest the prior high of $100. Right now we're slightly above the 50% retrace level of about $5.90, giving us some good odds this will move back up higher (in the near term). Not only that, due to the future projections I noted above, that also gives us a good chance it'll continue up. Finally, the uptrend, shown with the lines suggest the trend still isn't broken, thus we should still continue up, even if not as fierce as the last two days. There are still a lot of longs who are waiting to buy and a lot of shorts who are waiting to cover. whatever happens today will determine which way it heads.Longer term however, the charts show we will be re-testing the $8 range, and then $10, and so on. Longer term charts prevail over a greater time period. Good luck y'all!https://photos.app.goo.gl/8zZoftCXZRw1RQSPA",0.995

2734,"This may Help. 5 Dangers Buying Here are 5 key questions and answers about trading in shares of a company that has declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy, courtesy of the Securities and Exchange Commission (important caveat: these rules do not apply to Chapter 7 bankruptcy).QUESTION 1: How can shares of a company that is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings continue to trade?ANSWER: A company's securities may continue to trade even after the company has filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11. In most instances, companies that file under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code are generally unable to meet the listing standards to continue to trade on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. However, even when a company is delisted from one of these major stock exchanges, their shares may continue to trade on either the OTCBB or the Pink Sheets. There is no federal law that prohibits trading of securities of companies in bankruptcy.QUESTION 2: What is the risk level of trading in shares of a Chapter 11 company?ANSWER: Buying common stock of companies in Chapter 11 bankruptcy is extremely risky and ""is likely to lead to financial loss"" according to the SEC. Although a company may emerge from bankruptcy as a viable entity, generally, the creditors and the bondholders become the new owners of the shares. In most instances, the company's plan of reorganization will cancel the existing equity shares. This happens in bankruptcy cases because secured and unsecured creditors are paid from the company's assets before common stockholders. And in situations where shareholders do participate in the plan, their shares are usually subject to substantial dilution.QUESTION 3: How do shares traded during bankruptcy proceedings re-emerge after bankruptcy?ANSWER: If the company does come out of bankruptcy, there may be two different types of common stock, with different ticker symbols, trading for the same company. One is the old common stock (the stock that was on the market when the company went into bankruptcy), and the second is the new common stock that the company issued as part of its reorganization plan.If the old common stock is traded on the OTCBB or on the Pink Sheets, it will have a five-letter ticker symbol that ends in ""Q,"" indicating that the stock was involved with bankruptcy proceedings. The ticker symbol for the new common stock will not end in ""Q.""Sometimes the new stock may not have been issued by the company, although it has been authorized. In that situation, the stock is said to be trading ""when issued,"" which is shorthand for ""when, as, and if issued."" The ticker symbol of stock that is trading ""when issued"" will end with a ""V"". Once the company actually issues the newly authorized stock, the ""V"" will no longer appear at the end of the ticker symbol. The SEC cautions investors to be sure to know which shares they are purchasing, because the old shares that were issued before the company filed for bankruptcy may be worthless if the company has emerged from bankruptcy and has issued new common stock. You've been warned",0.9821

2741,"1. It is known to the market for months by now PCG reorganization plan proposed to compensate $5.75B to TCC by issuing stock, and raise $12B through equity backstop investors. 2. Recent S3 filing and disclosure to raise upto $25.675B through issuing new equity which leaves $7.925B unaccounted for. 3. The remaining $7.925B could be used as a buffer for contingengency expenses such as new capital investment, or for future potential liability which is good for shareholders. This could potentially signall to investor communities that PCG would be a investment grade company backed up by shareholders to raise any additional capital needed for modernizing PCG grid infrastructure after the bankruptcy exit. This could also help PCG to negotiate with CPUC and Governor Newsome who have been insisting PCG to have financial leverage to fund future infrastructure upgrade. The dilution would not come at once. This would be executed over time as needed. Moreover, dilution most likely won't have impact on investor's return as CPUC has guarenteed at least 10.5% annual return for 2020 through 2023. Today's investors jitter caused by fear of dilution likely to die down sooner than expected. Note that PCG has already abosobed close to $6.5B of its loss in FY 2018 and 2019 through tax benefit and net operating income. Now PCG has only about $14B in loss in its balance sheet to recover, which is likely to be carried over for next 3 years for tax benefits. I personally believe there is a little to loose for current shareholders. Shareholders would definitely need to find a way to fund modernization of current infrastructure without depending too much on debt to keep PCG as investment grade utility.

2771,"The California Public Utilities Commission has oversight responsibilities over public utilities in California. It was commissioned, among other things, to establish service standards and safety rules for utility companies operating in the state of California. The California Public Utilities Commission essentially grants each utility company monopoly status within the state of California to provide utility services in designated regions of the state and regulates their operations. Currently these state utility regulators are investigating PG&E to determine if they complied with state laws in the areas burned in the fires. If state laws were not complied with PG&E would need to identify those responsible, remove them and conceivably prosecute them. At the same time both PG&E and the Public Utilities Commission would need to put into place measures to prevent future non-compliance with state laws. If PG&E did not violate state laws, than the Public Utilities Commission would need to seek additional laws to mitigate those areas where existing laws fell short of their goal to provide safe utility services to the state of California. As for paying for the losses encountered over the past several years and the future costs involved in putting in place safe utilities services these should fall on the state of California and its residents. It's the residents that need and use utility services, it's the residents who established the Public Utilities Commission and who pay the salaries of its staff. Solely blaming PG&E and asking them to cover all losses is not a viable financial option for PG&E and will not happen. The losses stemmed from faults in electical transmission safety, whether or not blame can be ascribed to specific individuals ultimately does not matter. This was a costly systemic failure that needs to be fixed and all residents need to pull together to put in place measures to ensure a tragedy of this magnitude does not happen again.",-0.9412
2772,"Very interesting day of trading and AH. My guess is that the weak hands are being shaken out and the share price only has one way to go which is up from here. The ruling from Judge Monthali on Tuesday takes PG&E's future of exiting bankruptcy from an unknown % to probably more like 80-90% now. Think it thru, is PG&E solely to blame for wildfires in California??? Maybe there are other factors in play here? How about some of the CA laws that make home buying so difficult for the average wage earner? What happens? People end up buying homes in lower cost areas that are historically higher risk for wildfires. I thought that it was interesting that the Kincade Fire started near 'Burned Mountain Road' in Geyersville. Hmmm...Why was is it named Burned Mountain Road in the first place?? Next is a changing climate with a longer fire season, lower humidity & higher winds. Yes power lines will come down in 70-100mph winds and sparks will ignite fires. These are not issues for power utilities in other parts of the country. Then you have the underlying expectation that when you plug your phone charger into the wall outlet you'll be charged up and ready to stay in touch. Electricity is almost like Oxygen, when we don't have it we gasp. People are freaking out about the PSPS but then suing the electric provider? Seems like madness to me.Who is going to fix this? A multi-Billion dollar hedge fund that knows nothing about running a utility company? And where does that leave the employees, the union pension funds, and other CA resident stakeholders that are tied into PG&E? Whether shareholders or bondholders?I just don't see how PG&E can fail at this point and given the unique circumstances how the state government could ever turn their back on them. To me the day to day politics is noise and the outcome will be PG&E continuing to operate and working on more solid footing within the state politics and unique climate conditions.",0.9453

Spokeswoman Mindy Spatt says plunging customers into darkness when wildfire danger is high is a risk to public safety. Spatt says PG&E should make improving the safety of its equipment and training of its workers more of a priority than it appears the utility has done.PG&E filed its plan with the California Public Utilities Commission and a federal judge on Wednesday ___4:15 p.m.The nation's largest utility is promising to overhaul its wildfire-prevention measures in response to growing legal, financial and public pressure over its role in starting some of the most destructive blazes in California history.In a regulatory filing Wednesday, Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. proposes building new weather stations, fireproofing more miles of electrical wires and shutting off power to more customers more often when wildfire danger is highest.The embattled utility also vows to increase inspections, cut more trees and work with forestry experts to lessen its role in starting wildfires.PG&E and other utilities were required to file wildfire prevention plans with the California Public Utilities Commission. The agency has scheduled several public meetings to review the proposals before they are adopted. 2019 The Canadian Press. All rights reserved., source Canadian Press DataFileAgain just FYI",0.9641

2832,"PG&;E is for now still a solvent company. The bondholder (BH) classes are deemed unimpaired in both ch11 plans and thus have no meaningful vote in plan confirmation. In PG&Es case, the class in the driver seat is the most senior impaired creditor class; The TCC (Wildfire victims), The Subros (Insurance company claims) and Government claims (FEMA, CA, local govs etc). The Subros are firmly on the shareholder side, as evidence by the motion for and strong defense of their right to enter an RSA with PGE in support of their plan. The TCC was firmly in the bondholders(BH) camp, but that is in doubt now that PG;E has upped their offer ($13.5 billion) to match the BH plan. TCC lawyers have testified to the judge that they would settle for $13.5 billion, and that they would consider such an offer from PgE as well as the BH. In the end, the TCC and Govs will choose the plan offering the most money from the best source (Cash>Equity). With $34.45 billion available in new credit, Pge is in the better position to offer more cash than the BH - that is the speculation for equity survival & increase",0.9892

I have since received a response from PG&E which included my service statement for correct and corresponding usage (both electric & gas), Showing what the “smart meter” recorded. These figures do show an increase of usage but also confirm how much more I am now paying for each unit of energy. Also included in the letter response were rules and terse warning that I should not waste their time unless I had indisputable proof...whatever that means.PG&E never offered to come out and check their “smart meter” etc. In other words like it or lump it. I also received a letter response from the CPUC stating virtually the same language... Totally agreeing with PG&E, What a waste of time.. The CPUC is definitely in the pocket of this corrupt utility that blew up one city (San Bruno..where I live), and burned down another town (Paradise) and are now passing on to the consumer the total cost of their shoddy maintenance and bad management. What is so appalling and wrong is that the regulatory agency that is suppose to protect the consumer from these types of abuses instead sides with the utility and passes the costs onto the powerless consumer.

These inspections are one part of PG&E’s Community Wildfire Safety Program, which was implemented following the wildfires in 2017 and 2018 to provide additional precautionary measures intended to further reduce wildfire risk. This update is consistent with the commitment of PG&E’s new CEO and Board of Directors to keep their customers informed about the work being done to mitigate wildfire risks and safely deliver energy to their customers and communities.Through the end of May, PG&E ( PCG Loading...Loading...) has completed visual inspections of approximately 99 percent of its distribution infrastructure and visual or aerial inspections of approximately 98 percent of its transmission infrastructure in high-fire threat areas. This includes approximately 50,000 electric transmission structures, 700,000 distribution poles and 222 substations, covering more than 5,500 miles of transmission line and 25,200 miles of distribution line.Throughout the inspection process, PG&E ( PCG Loading...Loading...) has been addressing and repairing conditions that pose an immediate safety risk, while completing other high-priority repairs on an accelerated basis. Repairs for all other conditions are scheduled to be completed as part of PG&E’s work execution plan.“We’ve just concluded one of the most advanced inspections of our electric infrastructure in the high-fire threat areas and the number of safety issues we identified is unacceptable,” said Bill Johnson, President and CEO of PG&E ( PCG Loading...Loading...). “The safety of our customers and communities must be the driving factor in our approach to maintaining our electric system.

PG&E has beenpart of the California landscape for more than 100 years, and we care deeply about the communities thatwe serve and where our employees live and work.We recognize that the devastating and unprecedented Northern California wildfires of 2017 and 2018have had a profound impact on our customers and their communities.PG&E faces extensive litigation and significant potential liabilities resulting from these wildfires. It is clearthat a solution is needed that enables the continued safe delivery of natural gas and electric service to ourcustomers and supports the orderly, fair and expeditious resolution of PG&E’s potential liabilities resultingfrom the recent wildfires.We have determined that a Chapter 11 reorganization is the only viable option for meeting these goals. Anew California law requires PG&E to provide 15-days’ advance notice of a Chapter 11 filing to itsemployees. We provided that notice today, and we currently expect to commence the Chapter 11 processon or about January 29, 2019.What does this mean for PG&E customers’ service? We do not expect any impact to electric ornatural gas service for our customers as a result of the Chapter 11 process.Likewise, we remain committed to helping those impacted by the wildfires through the recovery andrebuilding process, and these efforts will continue.The Chapter 11 process helps provide access to the financial resources that are necessary to supportongoing operations. We are continuing to make critical investments in our systems and infrastructure tofurther improve safety. For example, our Community Wildfire Safety Program, an additional precautionarysafety measure implemented following the 2017 Northern California wildfires to further reduce wildfirerisk, includes: Conducting accelerated safety inspections of more than 50,000 transmission poles and towersacross 5,500 miles of transmission lines in the highest wildfire-threat areas, with similarinspections across distribution lines to begin early this year; Further enhancing vegetation management to increase focus on addressing trees and branchesthat pose a higher potential for wildfire risk; Investing in more real-time monitoring and intelligence like adding approximately 1,300 newweather stations and nearly 600 new, high-definition cameras; Installing stronger and more resilient poles and covered power lines in the highest fire-risk areas;and Replacing equipment to further reduce wildfire risks and tailoring upgrades based on terrain andweather conditions using more granular analysis of fire-prone regions.Throughout the reorganization process, our goal will be to work collaboratively to fairly balance the manyinterests of our stakeholders – including wildfire victims, customers, employees, creditors, shareholders,the financial community and business partners – while creating a sustainable foundation for the deliveryof safe and affordable service to our customers in the years ahead.As we move forward, we will work with our regulators, policymakers and other key stakeholders toconsider a range of alternatives to provide for the safe delivery of natural gas and electric service for thelong term in an environment that continues to be challenged by climate change.We recognize that we have a lot of work ahead to further improve our safety performance and rebuildcredibility and trust with you – our customers – the communities we serve, and other stakeholders acrossCalifornia, and we are absolutely committed to doing that.This is the first step in this process, and we will continue to keep you informed as we move forward.Additional information, including frequently asked questions, is available at pge.com/reorganization.Sincerely,John SimonInterim CEO""https://www.pge.com/pge_global/common/pdfs/about-pge/company-information/reorganization/reorganization-customer-letter.pdf",0.9978

As part of the reorganization, PG&E's 5.1 million electricity customers will have to pay above-market prices for several years to cancel the debt.2019 bankruptcyOn January 14, 2019 PG&E announced that it was filing for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in response to the financial challenges associated with the catastrophic wildfires that occurred in Northern California in 2017 and 2018.[57]On January 15, 2019 PG&E does not intend to make the interest payment of $21.6 million with respect to its outstanding 5.40% Senior Notes due January 15, 2040 which is worth $800 million.[clarification needed] Under the indenture the company has a 30-day grace period (expired on February 14, 2019) to make the interest payment before triggering an event of default.[58]According to Cbonds, the company has 32 bond issues overall and their outstanding amount is approximately equal to 17.469 billion US dollars.[59]",0.9676

3017,"Risks Remain, but PG&E Looks Undervalued After Exiting Bankruptcy. Here’s Why. By Alexandra ScaggsJuly 23, 2020 2:45 pm ETOrder ReprintsPrint ArticlePG&E, fresh out of bankruptcy, has more clarity on its wildfire liabilities than it has had in years. Here, a PG&E contractor works on a utility pole in Geyserville, Calif.Philip Pacheco/Getty ImagesText sizeIt’s not every day that a company fresh from bankruptcy looks like an undervalued investment. But that seems to be the case with PG&E.The utility holding company exited bankruptcy protection last month after a roughly 18-month restructuring process that came on the heels of two of the worst wildfire seasons in California history. Those wildfires led the company to plead guilty to 84 charges of involuntary manslaughter and pay more than $25 billion to cover the cost of the destruction.What remains after the bankruptcy process is a company that has monopoly power, a newly relaxed regulatory regime, reliable future revenue growth, and about $10 billion of potential future costs prepaid by its customers. Yet while PG&E (ticker: PCG) is cheap relative to its peers, it’s difficult to assess how much of its discount is warranted in light of a yearslong dividend suspension, among other lingering issues.“You’re buying a regulated utility company with a pretty solid core business and a low price-to-book value...and a massive discount on earnings power to most of its peers. That’s highly unusual,” says Jonathan Arnold, who covers the stock for Vertical Research Partners. “That’s not to say we think it should trade where its peers trade,” he adds, “but it’s a pretty interesting entry point for longer-term investors.”A Power Play?Risks remain for PG&E as wildfire season approaches, but its shares still lookundervalued.PG&E share price (PCG)Source: FactSet 2016KEY DATESOct. 8, 2017: Tubbs Fire startsNov. 8, 2018: Camp Fire startsJan. 29, 2019: PG&E files for bankruptcy protectionJuly 12, 2019: California passes wildfire-liability legislationOct. 27, 2019: PG&E implements widespread power outages to prevent firesJune 16, 2020: PG&E please guilty to involuntary manslaughterJuly 1, 2020: PG&E exits bankruptcyFor the first time in years, wildfires aren’t at the top of the list of near-term concerns for PG&E. While fires still pose a risk to the utility’s especially large and dry service area, PG&E has government safeguards that should protect it for at least a few years, and possibly longer, depending on the outcome of coming years’ wildfire seasons.First, because PG&E exited bankruptcy by June 30, the utility can now tap a $21 billion state-run fund to cover future catastrophic wildfire costs. Second, because the company is participating in that fund, state law now caps PG&E shareholders’ liabilities for wildfires at a fifth of the capital base it uses to set its electricity rates, or a three-year rolling sum of $2.4 billion, according to Citigroup.While most of PG&E’s wildfire costs are known and included in the $25.5 billion of settlements, analysts say, Edison International (EIX), the holding company for Southern California Edison, still has to resolve some wildfire liabilities. Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE), the holding company for San Diego Gas & Electric, are also participating in the $21 billion wildfire fund, so their future liabilities are capped.But Edison is trading at more than 12 times the consensus estimate for next year’s GAAP earnings per share, about double PG&E’s valuation of about six times, according to S&P Capital IQ. Sempra Energy, which is looking to expand its businesses outside of California, trades at about 15 times.Part of PG&E’s discounted valuation is derived from an expanded share count, as it issued $9 billion of shares to finance its exit from bankruptcy and sold an additional 22% ownership stake to a trust created to compensate wildfire victims. PG&E now has roughly 2.1 billion shares outstanding and a stock market capitalization of about $18 billion. Shareholders were spared more severe dilution because the company raised a significant amount of its settlement costs from debt markets.Still, while no new share issuance is expected soon, there are a few reasons that the utility deserves to trade at some discount to its peers. For one thing, the company’s criminal sentence may bar it from the portfolios of investors that keep a close eye on environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) issues. The company also is looking for a permanent CEO. Interim CEO Bill Smith, a PG&E board member who was formerly with AT&T Services, recently took over for Bill Johnson, the former Tennessee Valley Authority official who stepped down as the company exited bankruptcy.",0.9986

This is in line with the equity value dilution we incorporate into our fair value estimate. We think PG&E's bankruptcy filing on Jan. 29 anticipated these new charges. As a regulated utility, PG&E would have had to finance this charge to restore its equity balance in line with its regulatory allowed 52% equity structure. We saw no path for PG&E to do this as its stock bottomed near $6 per share.PG&E's investigation and investigations by other state authorities increasingly point to one of PG&E's transmission lines as the cause of the 2018 Camp Fire, which resulted in 85 deaths and more than 18,800 destroyed structures. This could make PG&E liable for substantial fire-related losses based on California's inverse condemnation statute. Ultimately, through bankruptcy, we think PG&E will settle claims for about $0.60 per $1. We estimate this is roughly what is represented in PG&E's accounting charge.Excluding charges, PG&E reported $4.00 per share of adjusted operating earnings for 2018, up from $3.68 per share in 2017. These results are slightly better than we expected, although not enough to affect our fair value estimate. We think PG&E's core business can grow 6% annually on a normalized basis if it continues with more than $6 billion of annual investment during the next few years. Growth opportunities include distribution upgrades and state-mandated disaster mitigation work.",0.972

However, one analyst says PG&E shares have more upside ahead once investor confidence returns.The PG&E Analyst: Bank of America analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith reiterated his Buy rating and $14 price target for PG&E.The PG&E Thesis: Dumoulin-Smith said PG&E shares have continued to lag its utility peer group, but that dynamic could change once a handful of overhangs are removed. He said PG&E’s new Wildfire Mitigation Plan (WMP) is an important step in the right direction.“We see the recently filed WMP as an opportunity to continue to focus on operational improvements given an enhanced risk model with machine learning capabilities (vs prior regression) to prioritize and execute on 80% of vegetation mgmt. and system hardening to be completed in the next three years in the top 20% riskiest zones,” Dumoulin-Smith wrote in a note.Bank of America estimates PG&E will require $600 million in financing following its recent $973 million telecom tower license sales deal. Dumoulin-Smith said investors should also expect to get a strategy and restructuring update from the company’s new management team, including CEO Patti Pope.Bank of America is projecting 2021 EPS of $1.02, suggesting the stock is trading at just 11.7 times forward earnings.",0.9897

3118,"PG&E : Critics ask what took PG&E so long on wildfire safety effort02/07/2019 | 11:31 pmSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. is promising to spend more than $2 billion this year to improve wildfire prevention after its equipment was blamed for causing more than 1,500 Northern California wildfires since 2014.Lawyers, industry watchdogs and a federal judge alike wonder: What took so long? They question the utility's sincerity in the face of decades-long record linked to wildfires.The advocacy group The Utility Reform Network and a lawyer representing hundreds of wildfire victims suing PG&E expressed skepticism on Thursday after PG&E submitted its proposed safety plan to regulators. Attorney Frank Pitre says PG&E has historically accepted high risks in its electrical operations.PG&E says it isn't waiting for regulatory approval and has already begun implementing enhanced safety measures meant to reduce the number of wildfires if causes.Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

There are billions and billions of dollars in contracts that will collapse if PG&E goes under, which would ""send potentially a very negative signal in terms of future development in California"" according to Jan Smutny-Jones, chief executive of Independent Energy Producers.""I mentioned how many hedgefunds and pensions/401k's etc are invested in PCG..""As of September 30th 2018, BlackRock owns almost $2 billion in market value of the company, totaling 48 million shares, totaling almost 10% of the PG&E. Vanguard is next, with $1.7 billion in market share.With regards to overall portfolio exposure, Springhouse Capital Management has 12.5% of their portfolio dedicated to PG&E.""""Baupost has dramatically increased the number of shares they hold in PG&E, going from 4.5 million in June 2018 to 18.9 million as of January 7th, 2019. That is a 4.2x increase. They are currently the top buyer of the stock.Baupost purchased the 14.4 million shares at the Q3 2018 share price of $45. With the stock now trading at $17, it could have been a painful few months for Baupost. Blue Mountain Capital increased their stake by 88%, believing that the markets reaction to the fires were overstated. Blue Mountain Capital has a target price of $59.10 for the stock, with an average analyst target price of $40.13, still more than double its current trading price.""I think this next part sums it up best...""The direction of PG&E is up in the air. They could file for bankruptcy, just as they did back in 2001, without much warning. Or they could take a bailout package from the state, potentially sweetened by lobbying money. Or their bond ratings could get slashed even more. Criminal charges could be brought against them. They could be converted into a publicly owned utility.But right now, PG&E's goal is to optimize shareholder return on investment. Institutional investors seem to recognize that, as hedge funds increase their stake in the company. Cash flows are positive. The company trades at an elevated PE ratio, but their EV / EBITDA value is far below industry peers.The company has room to the upside. But, they also have a series of extreme allegations against them. This seems to be an investment that could really pay off, or one that could collapse. Giving the company more time to sort itself out might be the best play here. However, if you think that the stock has bottomed out and the company will get bailed out, it would probably be a good buy.""There you go...place your bets....I'm betting no bankruptcy....but I bought a straddle just in case I'm wrong.....",0.9894

But the law says nothing about the fires of 2018, and in the wake of the Camp Fire — the deadliest in California history, with 86 fatalities — legislators are in no mood to provide additional protection to the company and its investors.“I just don’t think it’s a viable alternative at this time,” said state Sen. Bill Dodd, D-Napa, who authored SB 901.It doesn’t help PG&E’s cause that, as Newsom said Monday, it has lost much of its credibility.

3152,"Delivering for California: Industry Group SEPA Recognizes PG&E for Clean Energy ProgressSAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- While fans of professional golf were riveted to the Masters leaderboard last weekend, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E(PCG)) has earned a spot on a different kind of leaderboard – one recognizing utilities for their progress toward a modern, carbon-free electric system. Today, the Smart Electric Power Alliance (SEPA) released its comprehensive assessment of more than 100 U.S. utilities’ clean power efforts. PG&E(PCG) demonstrated significant progress, landing it on the 2021 Utility Transformation Leaderboard. SEPA launched the Utility Transformation Challenge this year in recognition of the increased industry focus on carbon reduction. SEPA analyzed surveys from 135 utilities, representing more than 83 million customer accounts, or approximately 63% of all U.S. electric customer accounts. “PG&E stands out due to its comprehensive efforts to transition to a carbon-free energy future, and most importantly, its results,"" said SEPA President and CEO Julia Hamm. ""The transformation to a clean and modern energy system involves much more than clean energy generation; it will require changes to almost every part of a utility’s business. We applaud PG&E(PCG) for its progress, and recognize that much work remains. The world does not have the luxury of time on carbon reduction."" The Utility Transformation Challenge evaluated utilities using a survey to assess their actions in four key areas: corporate leadership; clean energy resources; modern grid enablement; and aligned actions and engagement. “Earning a top spot on SEPA’s leaderboard is a little like earning the famed green jacket, but better, because it recognizes our progress toward a green energy future that benefits all of us,” said Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer of PG&E Corporation(PCG). “We recognize that our role in helping California achieve its climate and clean energy goals is possible only if we deliver on our safety commitments for our hometowns. Our focus is on transforming our business, culture and energy system to strengthen our Triple Bottom Line of serving people, the planet and prosperity for California.” SEPA’s assessment found that utilities with strong commitments to carbon reduction have made the most progress in creating a modern, clean electric grid. PG&E’s clean energy efforts include: • Delivering more than 88% of its electricity to customers from greenhouse gas-free resources including nuclear, large hydroelectric and eligible-renewable energy in 2020. • Exceeding California’s Renewables Portfolio Standard requirement of 33% by 2020 by delivering over 35% of electricity to customers last year from renewable energy, including solar, wind, bioenergy, geothermal and small hydroelectric (30 megawatts or smaller) power. In SEPA’s Annual Utility Market Survey, PG&E(PCG) ranked number one in 2019 and 2018 for annual solar megawatts. The Utility Transformation Challenge expands the survey focus. • Connecting more than 535,000 customers with private rooftop solar to the electricity grid, and supporting those customers with resources before, during and after they go solar. The rooftop solar in PG&E’s service area represents about 20% of all rooftop solar in the country. • Investing in Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) to enhance overall grid reliability, integrate renewables and help customers save energy and money. PG&E(PCG) has contracts for BESS projects totaling more than 1,400 megawatts, including one of the largest utility-owned lithium-ion BESS in the world, which is on track to become operational this summer. • Expanding access to electric vehicles (EV) and charging stations to reduce emissions and improve air quality. More than 327,000 EVs are registered in PG&E’s service area, accounting for approximately one in every five EVs in the nation. • Reducing its own carbon footprint with PG&E’s Million Ton Challenge, a voluntary goal to avoid one million tons of greenhouse gas emissions from its operations over five years. PG&E(PCG) is reducing methane emissions from its gas operations through a combination of advanced leak detection and repair strategies, pipeline replacements, operational improvements and research and development.",0.9996

So since the vote results and bankruptcy exit are highly probable, the price should climb higher post-events. The best place to see where the share price would steady state is looking at market cap of peers, and doing a small discount for debt load. Future fire risks would be mitigated by CA state going forward. Hence, target price should be mid $20's - $30 by end of year, even with new shares issues.",0.9837

Last year's loss included a $3.6 billion setback during the final three months of the year.￼The dismal numbers marked a low point the San Francisco company's 114-year history as it cleaned up a financial mess caused by its liability for a series of deadly fires in 2017 and 2018. The crippling burden prompted PG&E to file for bankruptcy protection 13 months ago, marking its second stint in bankruptcy in two decades.The losses reported Tuesday primarily stemmed from the cost of covering various settlements reached with PG&E's wildfire victims as part of the company's effort to meet a June 30 deadline for getting out of bankruptcy.Besides accounting for its past, PG&E also provided a glimpse at the road ahead. The outlook comes as PG&E tried to counter intensifying pressure from California Gov. Gavin Newsom to come up with a plan that gives it the financial muscle to make badly needed improvements in its decaying electrical grid to reduce wildfire risks.Newsom holds unusual leverage over PG&E at this point because the utility needs its bankruptcy plan to be blessed by the state by June 30 to qualify for coverage from a wildfire insurance fund created by California last summer. The Democratic governor so far has rejected PG&E's blueprint as unacceptable, partly because he believes the company is taking on too much debt to afford the necessary upgrades to its system.The tensions could eventually play out in bankruptcy court, where Newsom's lawyers have indicated they may want to grill PG&E about its finances.The projections released Tuesday envision PG&E rebounding this year with a profit of $454 million, with a slight 2021 loss caused by some accounting provisions stemming from its bankruptcy. By 2024, PG&E expects to post a full-year profit of nearly $2.4 billion. By comparison, it earned nearly $1.7 billion in 2017 before it was hit by the first wave of wildfire claims.As part of its recovery, PG&E is counting on a big helping hand from the roughly 16 million Northern Californians in the utility's sprawling service territory. The forecast envisions rates rising by 8% each year through 2024, far faster than the expected rate of inflation.And as it makes more money, PG&E is also promising to spend $37 billion to $41 billion on equipment upgrades and other improvements during the five-year period.To pay for that, in addition to the money owed to wildfire victims, PG&E plans to issue nearly $16 billion in additional stock and take on $38 billion in debt as part of its bankruptcy plan. The debt will cause PG&E's annual interest payments to rise by 50% between this year through 2024 when it will be doling out about $2 billion to its lenders, according to the company's projections.Investors' growing optimism about PG&E's ability to bounce back from bankruptcy has already lifted the company's stock by about 50% so far this year. The shares slipped 11 cents to $16.09 Tuesday. The stock peaked at $71.57 in September 2017 before PG&E's wildfire losses sent the company into a downward spiral.",0.9103

And if that’s the case, PG&E can liquidate the company themselves and get it for marker value which is a lot more than the 20 billion. On surface their plan seems great, but in actuality it’s not a plan at all. They’ve lost the fight for victims, their original offer was 13.5 B in cash. But victims lawyers went with PCG because the overall value of pcg offer is still better. The more victims gets paid the more cut the attorney gets so I’m sure they won’t take lesser value. If creditors really want to sweeten the deal they can offer up the whole $20 b injection cash up front, but that’ll cause a bidding war.

3283,"Now that the BS is done for the moment, let's get technical. Here's a little analysis for those of you keeping score at home. I've reviewed the various bankruptcy documents over the past few months and did some analysis. They're looking at needing to come up with 13.5 billion for wildfire victims, 11 billion for insurance subrogation, 1 billion for govt. entities, 5 billion for wildfire fund deposit, for a grand total of 30.5 billion. Funding is going to be something to the tune of 2.5 billion in collaterized tax savings, 12 billion in a rights offering, and 16 billion in debt, give or take. Assuming a P/E of 20, here's what the stock price should be accounting for diluted shares and reduced earnings to cover increased debt:Rights offering @ $15/share: Stock Value = $21Rights offering @ $20/share: Stock Value = $25Rights offering @ $25/share: Stock Value = $28So, let's just go ahead and keep this simple. As it sits now, it's a $25 stock that's going to open today at around $12. The analysis above shows you can make 100% return on this, as it sits. And there are quite a few things that could drive it higher such as the ongoing rate of return preceding, the dividend being reinstated, additional financial magic that limits the need to dilute shares, rate recovery for the Tubbs fire (that they did not cause), etc. This is a gold mine at $12 folks.

3310,"George Schultze, founder of distressed investor Schultze Asset Management, which has about $200 million under management, says he has already profited from shorting the shares of the utility that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Tuesday. That would make sense: PG&E's shares are down 40% this year, and have dropped nearly 70% since the wildfires began. And shareholders get paid back last in bankruptcy, behind bondholders, lawyers, and in this case, wildfire victims. But PG&E's stock surged after the filing, based on what Schultze says is a misguided bet on a bailout. (The shares down 4% on Thursday.) ""99.75% of the time, shareholders get nothing when a company goes bankrupt,"" Schultze tells Barron's at the Context Summits Miami conference. ""But there's false hope that won't be the case this time. A key part of that speculation is you have to assume the California legislature and California Public Utility Commission will bail you out. And here there is such aversion to that kind of deal."" The destruction wrought by the recent Camp Fire is too great, and too political -- 86 people died, thousands of acres scorched, thousands of structures destroyed. ""So, politically it's much more challenging than most cases to grant any recovery at all to shareholders,"" he says. Of the stock, ""our thesis is that it'll go to zero,"" he says.

Since the alarm went off in one of their lines, they have to check it out. Now, did fire cause the alarm or the equipment to cause the fire is unknown? PCG has said they don't have any data to show they caused the fire. Calfire will not rule on the cause of the Zoggs fire till 2021 or may be even later. Everyone knew that the Kinkaid fire was caused by a broken hook from the PCG Transmission line, yet they still have not ruled on it. Even if there was an equipment failure, my back of the envelope calculations puts the structure damages around 50 Million for 204 Structures destroyed and 27 Structures damaged. Igo and Shasta County seem very rural from the map, so I assumed the average home price around $200,000. There are also 1 injury plus 4 Fatalities.

3410,"Newsom is under extreme political pressure with the decision tomorrow. He wants fire victims to be treated fairly, for PG&E to have more cash to spend on new technology and fire prevention, as well as renewable energy. He wants PG&E to be transformed 180 degrees. The question we have to answer is if this deal accomplishes all of that. We don't know all the details, but according to this older article, it said FEMA and Cal Fire was not involved in the negotiations. Remember, yesterday FEMA wanted a $4 billion cut of that $13.5 billion settlement, which the lawyers for the fire victims rejects because it takes away funds from fire victims.Also, this calls for setting up a trust fund when they exit bankruptcy (summer of 2020), and then funding it with $5+ billion immediately, followed by hundreds of millions later down the short future after that. $6.75 billion from stock will also be given, but that's the part that's lacking details for the public. We don't know what type of dilution they'll do, if they'll do an ATM offering and just sell at the market share price and give proceeds to fire victims, or if they're going to do a mass dilution to get a large $6.75 billion right then and there (which depending on where the stock price is at the time, will make a YUUUUGGEE difference on how it affects dilution), or if they'll simply award stock warrants to fire victims and they'd be on their own to sell them whenever.This is the challenge because if there are more fires next year, the stock price will tank again, hurting fire victims. I don't think Newsom wants to see that. They'll only cancel existing shares and re-issue new shares via IPO like GM did if debt exceeds assets. Right now, their hope is there's some asset left after bankruptcy completes next year for shareholders.Supposedly polls show 90% of San Jose citizens want change in PG&E. If Newsom wants a political future he'll have to at the very least appear to be doing something. If he rejects the deal completely, it'll mean months or years of wasted time. If he accepts the deal, he may doom his political future. He may do what's best for him: partially reject the deal and have PG&E rework it, which I recall they will have about a week to make changes and have fire victims agree to it.From a technical chart standpoint, because the stock shot up from $8, I think we may see the low $10s or even mid $9s before we see $20.

While BlueMountain claims to have $19 billion in assets under management, this filing shows that PCG is the firm's third-largest equity stake based on today's price and that was obviously much higher at that time considering PCG ended September at $46. BlueMountain's Wikipedia entry shows that the fund managed $22 billion as of November 2016; so between then and now, the firm's AUM has decreased by $3 billion, either through investor redemptions or capital losses. 2018 was a volatile year, so a 13% loss is not unheard of for a large fund, but it is something to be noted in assessing the firm's ability and motive for trying to enact change on the direction of PCG.",0.8169

The CNBC report followed a Reuters story over the weekend suggesting the utility is considering a bankruptcy filing and will potentially be taking a major financial charge in Q4.After Monday's close, S&P Global cut PG&E Corp’s credit rating from BBB- to B, a move that drops the company’s debt from investment grade to “highly speculative” non-investment grade, or “junk” status.According to Dumoulin-Smith, PG&E shareholders face extreme risk due to the probability of a bankruptcy filing, but the company’s underlying fundamentals outside of its wildfire liabilities are sound. Despite the bankruptcy fears, Dumoulin-Smith said the state of California will likely prefer a different route.“We believe California leadership understands the broader translation of higher cost of capital to ratepayers is likely worse via a bankruptcy rather than a tangible financing solution for current wildfire liabilities, based on Governor Newsom’s comments yesterday,” he wrote in Wednesday's note.He said the risk-reward balance is favorable for investors ahead of the critical Jan. 10 California Public Utilities Commission meeting that will address PG&E’s liability problems.Price ActionPG&E recovered by 9 percent Wednesday to trade at $19.10 per share, but the stock remains down 60 percent in the past three months.",-0.913

3434,"Analyst NoteTravis Miller, Strategist, 23 December 2019We are reaffirming our $11 per share fair value estimatefor PG&E after the company settled its 2020-22 generalrate case and regulators signed off on a 10.25% allowedreturn on equity last week. We are reaffirming our no-moatand very high uncertainty ratings.These developments, along with a settlement announcedDec. 17 resolving regulators' wildfire safety investigation,clear what we considered the highest regulatory hurdlesto PG&E's timely bankruptcy exit. This gives us confidencethat regulators can sign off on a bankruptcy exit plan byJune 30, 2020.The developments show that California's core utilityregulation remains constructive. PG&E's allowed returnon equity is about 100 basis points higher than the allowedreturns that other state regulators have awarded utilitiesrecently. California's forward-looking rate structure alsois more constructive than most state rate structures.The settlement also shows that stakeholders supportconstructive regulation. PG&E's three-year plan adds$1.26 billion, or 15%, to its revenue requirement to supportinfrastructure investment and represents about two thirdsof PG&E's request. This is in line with our expectation afteradjusting for offsetting cost reductions.We expect PG&E still will have trouble earning the settledallowed return and its cost of capital for the next fewyears, supporting our no-moat rating. PG&E agreed toself-fund $1.765 billion of wildfire-related investments aspart of the safety investigation settlement and foregorecovery of certain expenses in its base rates. We alreadyinclude this in our fair value estimate.In the bankruptcy case, reports suggest bondholders are still pitching an exit plan that would effectively wipe outshareholders. We think the odds are long after thebankruptcy court approved PG&E's $25.5 billionsettlement with wildfire victims last week.

The April 20 call is most active, but there's also interesting activity at the weekly 4/5 20-strike call, where it appears new positions are being sold. If this is the case, call writers are banking on the $20 level to serve as a short-term ceiling through expiration at the close tomorrow, April 5.More broadly speaking, long calls have been popular. Data from the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) shows speculative players have bought to open 23,137 calls in the last 10 sessions, compared to 5,669 puts. Considering how short interest increased by 24% in the two most recent reporting periods, its possible some of this call buying could be shorts seeking an options hedge.PG&E stock has spent most of 2019 churning below that round $20 level -- home to an early January bear gap. In the past six months, the shares have shed 59%, mostly in reaction to the deadly California wildfires in 2018.

3600,"CPUC: Investigators Found PG&E Falsified Thousands of 'Call Before You Dig' RecordsThe California Public Utilities Commission is looking into allegations that PG&E falsified reports relating to construction crew and homeowner requests to locate and mark natural gas lines. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)State utility regulators announced Friday they're launching an investigation into whether PG&E has falsified records related to requests from construction crews and homeowners to mark the location of its natural gas lines.The formal California Public Utilities Commission probe follows an exhaustive review of PG&E's ""locate and mark"" practices by the agency's Safety and Enforcement Division.The locate and mark program, best known through a national publicity campaign that urges people to ""Call Before You Dig,"" is designed to lessen the threat to life and property caused by breaches of natural gas lines.In an order issued Thursday and made public Friday, the CPUC said its safety division is alleging the company violated state law requiring utilities to promptly respond to excavators' requests to find and mark underground utilities so that they would not be damaged during construction.The safety division says PG&E then created records that falsely reported that the company had responded within the legally specified timeframe to the ""locate and mark"" requests.Under California law, the CPUC reports says, utilities are generally obligated to locate and mark underground utilities between two and 14 days after an excavator's request. The companies file ""late tickets"" when they fail to carry out the location and marking on time.In PG&E's case, the safety division found that the company's failure to ensure records were kept accurately resulted in undercounting ""tens of thousands of late tickets"" each year between 2012 and 2016.The Safety Enforcement Division's conclusions are outlined in a massive report that relied on its own investigation and studies done by consultants hired by PG&E.PG&E Asks for Billions of Dollars From Ratepayers for Fire Safety, Plant DecommissioningOne of the consultant's reports concluded that PG&E didn't have enough personnel to locate and mark utilities in a timely manner, that the company ""placed inherent pressure"" on employees to complete the work, and that ""it was common knowledge among supervisors that locators entered false notes to avoid tickets from going late.""The CPUC's order emphasized it has not yet determined that PG&E broke the law. But the document noted that the time frame targeted in the safety division's investigation was one during which the utility was under especially close scrutiny for its safety practices.""This is the period immediately following the 2010 San Bruno gas explosion and fire that resulted in eight fatalities, numerous injuries and damage to property,"" the order said. ""This commission would expect that after such a tragedy, caused by multiple proven violations of law, PG&E would have sought to vigorously enhance and increase its effectiveness in all aspects of its gas safety.""The company seemed to acknowledge missteps in a statement issued late Friday afternoon:""At PG&E, our most important responsibility is public and employee safety. We’re committed to accurate and thorough reporting and record-keeping, and we didn’t live up to that commitment in this case. Once that became apparent, we took and continue to take additional actions to meet the regulatory standards related to our Locate and Mark record-keeping. Among those actions are: improvements to our system that tracks 811 tickets; an upgraded review and audit protocol; hiring more employees, and enhanced training for employees, to perform this work. We are aware of and cooperating with the CPUC’s investigation. We are fully committed to keeping our customers, communities and co-workers safe every single day.""The utility was convicted in 2016 of violating federal pipeline safety laws before the San Bruno disaster and is currently serving five years of probation. A CPUC finding that PG&E falsified records and violated state statues would violate the first condition of the company's probation, which is that it shall not break federal, state, or local laws.PG&E's possible role in starting the catastrophic Camp Fire in Butte County has already been raised in connection with the utility's probation in the San Bruno case.U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup, currently overseeing utility's probation, recently ordered the company, the U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco and court-appointed monitor Christopher Keegan to report on what role, if any, PG&E had in causing the Camp Fire and all other fires since its probation began early last year.In an order issued late last month, Alsup also asked for an assessment of whether ""any inaccurate, slow, or failed reporting of information about any wildfire"" by PG&E ( To be continued",-0.5837

3619,"Oh My God: I WAS GOING LONG UNTIL REUTERS NEWS SAID....By the start of this week, many investors and state officials appeared resigned to the company’s filing. The California Public Utilities Commission held an emergency meeting Monday to approve PG&E’s plan to borrow $5.5 billion to finance itself over the next two years while it is in bankruptcy.California’s lawmakers thought they had taken care of PG&E’s wildfire liabilities last year when they passed legislation that allows the utility to raise rates to pay damage claims from the 2017 wildfires. After the November fires, lawmakers were considering expanding that legislation to cover 2018.But they abandoned that proposal two weeks ago when the utility announced that it would seek bankruptcy protection.ADVERTISEMENTAssemblyman Chris Holden, chairman of the Utilities and Energy Committee, said Tuesday that he was drafting a bill to direct the California Public Utilities Commission to press PG&E to fully compensate wildfire victims. The legislation would also direct the commission to resist efforts by the utility to raise electricity rates. Mr. Holden, a Democrat from Pasadena, said he hoped it would pass before the company submitted its restructuring plan in court.Assemblyman Marc Levine, a Democrat from Northern California, said the Legislature ought to revise or revoke parts of the 2018 law, a step that could increase losses for PG&E’s creditors and suppliers.“In the longer run, the Legislature and the administration have an obligation to ensure that the company’s ratepayers and fire victims are prioritized over shareholders,” Mr. Levine said.Lawmakers who have long been critical of PG&E, including State Senator Jerry Hill, a Democrat from San Francisco, are pushing for even farther-reaching changes. Some of them want PG&E’s gas and electric divisions separated or would like to break up the utility into smaller businesses with a smaller geographic footprint.YIKES.",0.7443

However, in the multitude of civil trials, facing them PGE will more than likely NOT PREVAIL due to the fact that evidence used in the criminal case will provide enough evidence for the civil trials. Simple fact is that the greater weight of the evidence required in a civil (non-criminal) lawsuit for the trier of fact (jury or judge without a jury) to decide in favor of one side or the other. This preponderance is based on the more convincing evidence and its probable truth or accuracy, and not on the amount of evidence as was the case in he criminal trial.

3642,"So this is only my opinion not meant to pump or telling anyone to sell off. But the judge ruling is probably not priced in yet. After ruling we can expect a boost in current price (I still think 20-40% increase pending on its a one day or two days rally, which means it probably won’t hit high teens or low twenties like some hope). That said, judge approval is just part of the process. They still have to work out the trust and how much fund they’ll need to raise (basically dilution). Part of that dilution goes to victims trust which the market probably won’t see til a year from now (cause I don’t think it’s thesisable for them to unload all their stocks by Jan 2021 while getting victims their max value; hence the timeline is still being worked on n probably goes into 2022). Backstop will have the opportunity to buy some of the new shares at a discounted price of low teens. Meaning right now this price is that we got the stock at is currently cheaper than victims n backstop. N the projection is that in the next few months the value is expected to be higher since wild fire is out of the equation with wild fire fund. If short thinks it’ll go back down to single digits, it’s unlikely. But if long thinks it’ll go to $20 or more within a week that’s just as unlikely. Personally I’m selling some after judge announcement to reinvest in other cheap stocks, while leaving some in for long term (3+ years). There’s still a lot of details that haven’t been released yet, n I think once there’s more clarity this stock will attract more investors long term. Again just my opinion",0.9978

On average, EV customers on the new rate can save up to 40% on charging costs compared to previous rate options, although actual bill impacts will vary for each customer depending on types of vehicles and charging patterns. Customers on PG&E’s Business EV Rate achieve cost savings through a new feature called a subscription charge, which allows customers to choose the amount of kilowatt power they need for their charging stations, similar to choosing a data plan for a phone bill. This subscription charge can be much lower than current rate options, and allows customers to have simpler, more consistent monthly costs. On the Business EV Rate, customers pay for the electricity used by the EV chargers and the monthly subscription charge. Customers can always adjust their subscription levels up or down to meet their changing needs for EV charging. Access to more affordable rates and greater bill certainty will help innovative California businesses make new investments in EV charging infrastructure and expand their EV fleets. PG&E Ongoing Support for EV Customers Today, approximately 303,000 EVs are registered in PG&E’s service area – roughly one in every five EVs in the nation. PG&E(PCG) continues to make it easier for customers to consider EVs through special rates, a total cost of ownership tool, and rebates, as well as the construction of a charging infrastructure through its EV Charge Network, EV Fleet and EV Fast Charge programs. These programs are each working toward the state’s larger goals of 250,000 charging stations, including 10,000 fast chargers, and 200 hydrogen fueling stations statewide by 2025",0.9868

During a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the company continues its daily operations, but all significant business decisions are made by the bankruptcy trustee. The stock continues to trade during that time. However, the stock is usually de-listed from the major exchanges since the company no longer meets the listing requirements. This usually has a significant impact on the stock’s price and liquidity. The stock may continue to trade over the counter or on the pink sheets as there is no federal law that prohibits trading. Still, no dividends are paid by the company while it is in the bankruptcy process.

""The data currently available to PG&E do not establish the causes of the activity on the Girvan 1101 circuit or the locations of these causes.""Item 8.01 Other EventsOn October 9, 2020, Pacific Gas and Electric Company filed an electric incident report with the California Public Utilities Commission indicating that:“On September 27, 2020, a wildfire began in the area of Zogg Mine Road and Jenny Bird Lane, north of Igo in Shasta County, California (the “Zogg Fire”). The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (“CAL FIRE”) website, dated as of October 9, 2020, 6:20 a.m. Pacific Time (the “CAL FIRE website”), indicates that the Zogg Fire had consumed 56,338 acres and was 95% contained. The CAL FIRE website reported four fatalities and one injury. The CAL FIRE website also indicated that 27 structures were damaged and 204 structures were destroyed.Wildfire camera and satellite data on September 27, 2020 show smoke, heat or signs of fire in that area between approximately 2:43 p.m. and 2:46 p.m.Customers in the area of Zogg Mine Road and Jenny Bird Lane are served by a PG&E distribution line —the Girvan 1101 12 kV circuit. According to PG&E’s records, on September 27, 2020, a PG&E SmartMeter and a line recloser serving that area reported alarms and other activity between approximately 2:40 p.m. and 3:06 p.m., when the line recloser de-energized that portion of the circuit. The data currently available to PG&E do not establish the causes of the activity on the Girvan 1101 circuit or the locations of these causes.On October 9, 2020, CAL FIRE informed PG&E that they had taken possession of PG&E equipment as part of CAL FIRE’s ongoing investigation into the cause of the Zogg Fire and allowed PG&E access to the area.

I just saw the SEC filing, they have calculated that there could be an overall total of 1.9877 to 2.0247 billion outstanding shares once the plan is fully executed.At 1.9877 billions we are looking at about 15.30 per shareAt 2.0247 billions we are looking at about 15.02 per share pending on how much underwriter wants.Again this calculation is base on the math that they think they are worth at least $30.4 billion. But at the current share price of 10.22 they are a $20.3 to $20.6 billion dollars company.To put things in prospective for the past 5 years,2015-2017 no wild fires, old equipment, some debts, possible wildfire liabilities, pay dividendsthey were $50-70 stock which makes them a $26-37 billion company with $60 per share being the happy medium it's about $32 billion.Fast forward to 2018 they were a $21-25 billion with one wild fire claims pending, old equipment, some debts, and future wildfire liabilities.Now 2020 increased debts, two wild fires claims settled, no dividends for 3 years, no future wildfire liabilities for probably 2-3 years, ongoing upgraded equipment (should in term upgrade assets worth). At current price they are worth $20.3 - 20.6 billion with dilution already built in but they think it's worth $30.4 billion which is still less than $60 per share back in 2015-2017 at $32 billion.Personally looking at the conditions I think that's a fair assumptions, if anything it seems like they might have undervalued their worth to attract more investors. Lastly base on the SEC filing, unless DOW is down, I can see a gap up for PCG at its current price since it seems like investors for the 5.75 billion can buy in at $10.52 or current market value whichever of the two that is lowest at the time the underwriter determines. Another word those screaming at dilutions and it's going to drive the stock price down, it probably won't happen but then again it's the stock market so anything can happen.

With today barely selling down, it shows a lot of strength left. Any selling was met quickly with buys, either from trapped shorts, or longs waiting to get in/back in. A bullish ascending triangle is forming. When the convergence of the two lines pushes up past the resistance (pink arrows), the stock should shoot up, into the high $6s, possibly hitting $6.80s or so before selling back down into the $6.40s. It should then slowly consolidate and move back up to close in the $6.6 range. By mid next week, we should be back over $7.The circled red area is where there's no resistance (i.e. a gap to fill back up to $7.5), meaning there won't be a lot of selling pressure. In fact, there would be buying pressure from shorts who shorted in the $7-$8 range buying to cover in order to lock in some measly profit they wish they'd done while the stock was in the $3s and $4s.

""We recognize that more must be done to adapt to and address the increasing threat of wildfires and extreme weather in order to keep our customers and communities safe,"" said interim CEO John Simon. ""We are taking action now on important safety and maintenance measures identified through our accelerated and enhanced safety inspections and will continue to keep our regulators, customers and investors informed of our efforts.""PG&E shares fell 4.5% to close at $17.03 following the news.""The company is facing extraordinary challenges relating to the 2018 Camp Fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. Management has concluded that these circumstances raise substantial doubt about PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's ability to continue as going concerns,"" the company said.Last November, PG&E warned investors that it faced ""significant"" liability, over and above its insurance capacity, if its equipment was found to have started the deadly Camp Fire that started in the city of Paradise and spread through much of Northern California, killing at least 86 people and causing billions in economic and environmental damage.Last month, PG&E's board of directors said it was ""actively assessing PG&E's operations, finances, management, structure, and governance -- and remains focused on improving safety and operational effectiveness,"" in addition to the prior actions it had taken to ""confront the growing wildfire threat.""The California Public Utilities Commission said in late December it was investigating PG&E's role in falsifying data related to the safety of its natural gas pipelines.""Utility falsification of safety related records is a serious violation of law and diminishes our trust in the utility's reports on their progress,"" the Commission said.

A bankrupt company, the ""debtor,"" might use Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to ""reorganize"" its business and try to become profitable again. Management continues to run the day-to-day business operations but all significant business decisions must be approved by a bankruptcy court. Normally the common stock is cancelled, becomes worthless and replaced with new issue.",0.8316

3908,"PG&E Stock Is Going to Zero, Hedge Fund Says, managed by George Schultze, founder of distressed investor Schultze Asset Management, which has about $200 million under management, says he has already profited from shorting the shares of the utility that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection recently That would make sense: PG&E’s shares are down 40% this year, and have dropped nearly 70% since the wildfires began. And shareholders get paid back last in bankruptcy, behind bondholders, lawyers, and in this case, wildfire victims. But PG&E’s stock surged after the filing, based on what Schultze says is a misguided bet on a bailout. (The shares down 4% on Thursday.)“99.75% of the time, shareholders get nothing when a company goes bankrupt,” Schultze tells Barron’s at the Context Summits Miami conference. “But there’s false hope that won’t be the case this time. A key part of that speculation is you have to assume the California legislature and California Public Utility Commission will bail you out. And here there is such aversion to that kind of deal.”The destruction wrought by the recent Camp Fire is too great, and too political -- 86 people died, thousands of acres scorched, thousands of structures destroyed. “So, politically it’s much more challenging than most cases to grant any recovery at all to shareholders,” he says. Of the stock, “our thesis is that it’ll go to zero,” he says.A spokeswoman for PG&E said the company does not comment on market rumor or speculation. Schultze says his rationale is supported by some moments at a recent hearing before the CPUC, where members from the Democratic Socialists of America suggested the government take over the utility, which will by no means, benefit shareholders. California’s “inverse condemnation” rulemeans the state can hold investor-owned utilities liable for fires that their equipment helped to start, even if the company wasn’t negligent. This is mitigated in part by a state law passed last year that makes it easier for utilities to pass wildfire costs to rate payers, and in some cases allows utilities to issue bonds to cover the costs. That means there is a chance that rate payers, and shareholders, will end up paying for liabilities connected to last year’s Camp Fire.And Judge William Alsup, presiding over the criminal conviction against PG&E from a pipeline explosion in 2010, highlighted that the company had paid out $4.5 billion in dividends to shareholders over the preceding five years. That money could have been used to cut down trees, which could have helped to limit or prevent fires, the judge said. And that is the exact kind of corporate structure that concerns those who have invested in what will ultimately turn a big fat Zero.",0.9672

3923,"More recent calamities have had to do with mega wildfires in which PG&E’s electrical equipment has been the prime suspect. With the utility still on federal probation for six felonies related to the San Bruno explosion, Cal Fire has linked PG&E to 17 major wildfires in 2017.Investigators said the utility broke a law in a dozen of those cases. Meanwhile, PG&E’s response to a couple of those 2017 fires has gotten the utility into trouble in federal court.A U.S. District Court judge in San Francisco ordered PG&E to come to court next week to answer charges that the company violated the terms of its probation by failing to notify its probation officer that it had settled with Butte County over its role in three 2017 fires there, including one in which the county was criminally investigating PG&E for failing to trim trees near power lines. Those charges were later dropped.The Tubbs Fire in Napa and Sonoma counties, which killed 22 people and destroyed more than 5,600 structures, was traced by Cal Fire to privately owned electrical equipment. That verdict, in theory, should have tempered some animosity, but it didn’t.“It’s not the end of the story,” said Noreen Evans, a former state legislator now with Watts Guerra LLP representing more than 4,000 wildfire victims.Evans said she believes PG&E is still liable for the Tubbs Fire because private investigators and witnesses have come to different conclusions than Cal Fire, and she cited a 2015 audit by the California Public Utilities Commission that found PG&E was behind in vegetation and equipment management in the region where the Tubbs Fire started.“PG&E seems to be an outlier as far as public safety is concerned,” Evans said. “It seems to have a culture that doesn’t prioritize public safety and it should. That needs to change.”",-0.7917

At the time, the fires were the most destructive in California history. Then, little more than a year later, the tragedy of the Northern California Fires would be surpassed by an even more destructive and deadly blaze, the Camp Fire, which ignited in November 2018 in Butte County, California. This catastrophic event claimed the lives of at least 86 people. The Camp Fire was reportedly the world's costliest natural disaster in 2018. Following those events, the company facing an estimated $30 billion in potential liability has filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy.On February 22, 2019, a lawsuit was filed over alleged securities laws violations in connection with the above stated note offerings. More specifically, the plaintiff claims that PG&E raised billions of dollars from investors through the sale of senior notes, that PG&E's conduct has subsequently been revealed to contradict the representations made to investors in the offering documents for the above stated notes offerings, and that as a result of the tragic events, the prices of PG&E bonds have plummeted, adding hundreds of millions of dollars' in investor losses to the devastation wrought by the Company's conduct.Those who purchased any of the above listed PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG) senior notes, have certain options and should contact the Shareholders Foundation, Inc.CONTACT:Shareholders Foundation, Inc.Michael Daniels+1 (858) 779-1554mail@shareholdersfoundation.com3111 Camino Del Rio NorthSuite 423San Diego, CA 92108The Shareholders Foundation, Inc. is a professional portfolio legal monitoring and a settlement claim filing service, which does research related to shareholder issues and informs investors of securities class actions, settlements, judgments, and other legal related news to the stock/financial market.

Gavin Newsom.The CPUC granted the electric monopoly a 2021 state safety certificate even though PG&E was charged this month with 33 crimes in Sonoma County for sparking the 2019 Kincade Fire and is under investigation for possible murder charges in Shasta County because of the 2020 Zogg Fire, which killed four people.Multiple critics told the five CPUC commissioners Thursday that the safety certificate gives PG&E a “license to burn.”Under the terms of AB 1054, the state law that bailed PG&E out of bankruptcy, utilities pre-certified as “safe” are not required to prove they acted reasonably to charge customers for the cost of the damage caused by the flames.The safety certificate also gives PG&E the ability to tap into a multibillion-dollar state wildfire fund, paid for by customers, to help pay damages to fire victims-- and perhaps most importantly, it caps the amount of fire damage that PG&E shareholders would be on the hook for paying back to the fund.The CPUC did vote Thursday to put PG&E on what it calls “enhanced oversight,” a move that in effect requires PG&E to file more reports to the CPUC about how it is fixing problems it’s had meeting some of its safety goals.",-0.5923

4037,"This article points out just how much a bankruptcy could effect even the very people wanting to sue for damages be it death or property or both.Bankruptcy could affect wildfire victims seeking damages because the filing triggers a stay on lawsuits against PG&E. Multiple victims of the Camp Fire have already sued PG&E alleging negligence and health and safety code violations by the utility. That comes on the heels of dozens of lawsuits related to fires in 2017.“They can ultimately have their claim determined outside of the bankruptcy court, but it still is a claim of the bankruptcy,” Felderstein said. “So if the creditors only end up getting paid a percentage of the amount they are owed, then that would affect the injured parties as well.”If wildfire victims aren’t happy with the reorganization, it could be that their claims are so large that they can veto the plan. “It isn’t for sure that they’d be able to stop a plan, but obviously there’d be a chance that they could,” Felderstein said.Michael Wara, director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program at Stanford University, says the state shouldn’t allow PG&E to go bankrupt because it would be expensive for ratepayers to pay back that debt. As it is, the utility already has sought permission from U.S. energy regulators for a 9.5 percent increase in transmission charges due to the higher risk of wildfires. PG&E says that translates to an increase of $1.50 per month for the average residential customer.“Ultimately, the customers pay,” he said.That was the case when PG&E filed for bankruptcy during California’s power crisis.Although the filing did not trigger layoffs, the AP noted that ratepayers were stuck with paying back the bills for years and years. At the time, the rehabilitation was expected to cost customers $6.2 billion to $8.2 billion in above-market prices through 2012. That worked out to about $1,300 to $1,700 per customer.Bankruptcy also makes it more difficult for the state to achieve its clean-energy goals. By 2045, the state wants 100 percent of electricity to be powered by renewable resources such as wind and solar, as well as zero-carbon energy sources such as nuclear power.PUC president Michael Picker said he can’t imagine allowing the utility to go bankrupt but he didn’t rule out the possibility of a break up. “It’s not good policy to have utilities unable to finance the services and infrastructure the state of California needs,” Picker said.",0.989

PG&E shares jumped more than 25% after Bloomberg News circulated a report from publication SparkSpread, which apparently said the Buffett-led conglomerate was in talks to buy the utility. They were still up 3.5% shortly before Wednesday’s opening bell.Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, told CNBC that the report was “100% not true” and that he “would know” if Berkshire Hathaway was in talks to acquire the company. PG&E declined to comment for this story.PG&E, California’s largest investor-owned utility, could face $30 billion in potential liabilities from wildfires in 2017 and 2018.The company’s share price plunged late last year as the deadliest fire in the state’s history — thought by many to be a product of PG&E equipment — ravaged the area surrounding Paradise, California.

Not approving and letting PCG get out of bankruptcy can cause a chain reaction in everything else that’s been set in place. I can’t see it being beneficial to not let pcg get out of bankruptcy.

4147,"This is why PG&E was down today. PG&E Faces Criminal Charges Over 2019 Kincade FireBy Joel RosenblattApril 6, 2021, 3:19 PM EDT Updated on April 6, 2021, 4:09 PM EDTUtility giant PG&E Corp. faces criminal charges for its role in a 2019 wildfire that burned 78,000 acres in Northern California, another blow to a company with a checkered history of being blamed for disasters and endangering public safety.The company, which was driven into bankruptcy in 2019 after its equipment sparked blazes, faces five felony counts in connection with the Kincade Fire, which destroyed 374 buildings.The utility said it’s challenging the criminal charges, though it acknowledges findings by state investigators that its equipment causes the fire.“In the spirit of working to do what’s right for the victims, we will accept CAL FIRE’s finding that a PG&E transmission line caused the fire, even though we have not had access to the agency’s report or the evidence it gathered,” PG&E said in an emailed statement. “However, we do not believe there was any crime here. We remain committed to making it right for all those impacted and working to further reduce wildfire risk on our system.”State investigators previously determined that a broken PG&E cable started the Kincade Fire northeast of the town of Geyserville. The new charges come after PG&E pleaded guilty last year to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter for the deadliest fire in state history in 2018, and while the company faces scrutiny for yet another wildfire in 2020 that killed four people. Federal officials have told the judge overseeing PG&E’s criminal probation that evidence “strongly suggests” last year’s Zogg Fire in was caused by a tree falling on the utility’s equipment.Any criminal conviction is a violation of probation. It remains to be see how U.S. District Judge William Alsup, the judge overseeing PG&E’s probation, will react to the criminal charges. The judge, a harsh critic of the company, has said he’s determined to prevent the utility’s equipment from being the cause of another fire.The day's biggest storiesPG&E’s equipment was long suspected of causing the Kincade fire that started on Oct. 23, 2019, as the utility had reported that one of its transmission lines malfunctioned near the location and time of the start of the blaze. The company said in May that it could book a loss of at least $600 million stemming from damages tied to the wildfire.Brandon Gilbert, an assistant to Sonoma County District Attorney Jill Ravitch, didn’t immediately respond to a phone call seeking comment.Serving most of northern and central California, PG&E is the state’s largest utility and used to wield considerable clout in Sacramento. But as California’s weather has turned warmer and drier in recent decades, the company’s equipment has triggered a string of deadly wildfires that forced PG&E into bankruptcy in 2019 and led many critics to call for breaking up the company. PG&E emerged from Chapter 11 intact last year, but still faces deep skepticism from customers and California politicians alike.The company, and other utilities in the state, have responded to the fires by trying to harden their electric grids, making power lines less likely to fall during California’s autumn wind storms and less prone to spark flames if they do. They have also taken to cutting off electricity to customers in high-risk areas in advance of high winds. The preemptive blackouts infuriate customers but do appear to have reduced the number of fires triggered by power lines.",-0.9749

THE BOMB JUST HIT the press Shows why PG&E is going to have to pay.’ HEADLINES ""Sympathy is gone for utility facing bankruptcy"" FIRST READ THIS EXCERPT:Legislators gave PG&E a partial bailout in September by approving SB 901, which gave the company the ability to pass some of its wildfire liabilities onto ratepayers for the 2017 fires. But the law says nothing about the fires of 2018, and in the wake of the Camp Fire — the deadliest in California history, with 86 fatalities — legislators are in no mood to provide additional protection to the company and its investors.“I just don’t think it’s a viable alternative at this time,” said state Sen. Bill Dodd, D-Napa, who authored SB 901.It doesn’t help PG&E’s cause that, as Newsom said Monday, it has lost much of its credibility. The PUC recently accused the utility of falsifying natural gas pipeline inspection records — a stunning allegation in the wake of PG&E’s criminal conviction in connection with the deadly 2010 pipeline explosion in San Bruno.NOW THE ENTIRE BAD NEWS IF , after reading the above, you truly believe there is merit in going long on this, then you had best Drive to the nearest Psychiatric center and self surrender.

4251,"For your reading enjoymentPUC AGAIN TRIES TO HELP UTILITIES FIGHT THEIR BIG FEARJanuary 16, 2019 By Stephen Frank 1 CommentGood news for PG&E—the Public Utilities Commission may try to save it. The reality is the company is going into bankruptcy and will, I bet, be taken over by the government. Newsom will socialize this utility. Then using “Community Choice Aggregation” bankrupt the other utilizes, so the total control of our homes and businesses will be in the ownership of government—no private energy, unless you can get off the grid with solar panels.“That’s short for Community Choice Aggregation, a means allowing electricity consumers in some places to opt out of being served by the likes of Pacific Gas & Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. Municipally-owned and-operated CCAs generally charge a little less per kilowatt hour than the private companies and provide more energy from renewable sources like wind and solar. They use existing transmission lines to fetch power for their customers.It’s a nightmare for the utilities, which have already lost cities big and small to CCAs, cutting into their profits a bit. San Francisco Clean Power is a CCA. Marin, Sonoma and Mendocino counties also offer CCA service. Starting next month, customers in 31 Southern California cities plus the unincorporated areas of Los Angeles and Ventura counties will join the biggest-ever CCA unless they opt out in favor of sticking with Edison.”Utility users will be the immediate cost cutting to energy use. Then when government has complete control, like any other monopoly will raise the prices sky high—since there will be no competition—and government can stop anyone that tries to compete! Get ready to move to Texas—where you have a real choice in utilities.",0.9915

As a shareholder, you’re essentially a part owner of the company and, unfortunately, that means you’re also on the hook for the company’s debt.One metaphor might be having a car that you purchased with financing. You might have purchased the car, but if you don’t make the payments, you’ll forfeit ownership and the people who loaned you the money to buy the car will have it repossessed. So, if the company that you and the other shareholders own isn’t paying its debts anymore, bankruptcy usually involves repossessing the value held in your shares and giving it to the people who lent your company money.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/happens-stock-company-goes-bankrupt-171146196.html",0.9498

But this is happening for rather a strange reason.This morning, Reuters reported that PG&E has ""secured $5.5 billion in debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing from four banks as it prepares to file for Chapter-11 bankruptcy protection."" The funds, coming in the form of a $3.5 billion revolving credit line, a $1.5 billion term loan, and a $500 million delayed-draw term loan, will be used to keep the lights on and the turbines running at PG&E as it heads into what's expected to be about a two-year-long bankruptcy process, beginning on or about Jan. 29.Downed power linesDowned power linesDown more than 80% in a year, does PG&E stock look like a bargain to you? Image source: Getty Images.So whatHere's the thing: PG&E taking on $5.5 billion in additional debt might be a good thing for its customers, who will enjoy light and heat as a result. It may be a good thing for the folks suing PG&E, trying to get money in recompense for damages caused by last year's Camp Fire wildfire and other fires for which PG&E is blamed.However, it doesn't change the fact that PG&E shareholders will almost certainly be wiped out by the bankruptcy process and the estimated $30 billion in damages that PG&E will be trying to pay out of cash on hand, insurance proceeds, and -- this is key -- a market cap of barely $4 billion.Now whatIf and when that wipeout happens, PG&E stock that sells for $8 a share today could soon be worth $0.

4426,"MIAMI -- Shares of bankrupt California utility PG&E (PCG) have been going up, but this investor says it’s based on false hope.George Schultze, founder of distressed investor Schultze Asset Management, which has about $200 million under management, says he has already profited from shorting the shares of the utility that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Tuesday.That would make sense: PG&E’s shares are down 40% this year, and have dropped nearly 70% since the wildfires began. And shareholders get paid back last in bankruptcy, behind bondholders, lawyers, and in this case, wildfire victims. But PG&E’s stock surged after the filing, based on what Schultze says is a misguided bet on a bailout. (The shares down 4% on Thursday.)“99.75% of the time, shareholders get nothing when a company goes bankrupt,” Schultze tells Barron’s at the Context Summits Miami conference. “But there’s false hope that won’t be the case this time. A key part of that speculation is you have to assume the California legislature and California Public Utility Commission will bail you out. And here there is such aversion to that kind of deal.”The destruction wrought by the recent Camp Fire is too great, and too political -- 86 people died, thousands of acres scorched, thousands of structures destroyed. “So, politically it’s much more challenging than most cases to grant any recovery at all to shareholders,” he says.",0.5311

The longer this drags on, the worse the outcome will be for common equity holders.Now, three months after PG&E filed for bankruptcy, there is still no plan in sight. As recently as April 29th, PG&E CFO Jason Wells said, ""until we have a better handle on the total claims exposure as well as the legislation to reform wildfire liability laws, we are not in a position to be able to put forward a plan of reorganization."" Related to compensation for Wildfire victims, Wells also said, ""we don't have a plan at this point.""This follows the release of a report by California Governor Newsom's office on April 12th which outlined several proposed changes to California's ""inverse condemnation"" rules, which currently say PG&E can be held liable for damage caused by its equipment, even if the company wasn't negligent. Since the report was issued April 12, the company has met with the governor's office and other advisers to discuss the next steps, but Wells admitted ""it's going to require a significant amount of work, not just by those in Sacramento, but by all of the stakeholders that are impacted by these issues."" There is no quick fix for PG&E and the bankruptcy looks to drag on longer. PG&E said it could take approximately two years to emerge from bankruptcy. However, it could drag on even longer as it took 3 years during PG&E's last bankruptcy organization in 2001.NOT GOOD PEOPLE. JUST SELL THIS GARBAGE and buy the new issue whenever it comes out.

4551,"Since many California retirement funds have investments in PG&E, I suspect that the primary purpose of this dividend cut is the motivate those owning those funds to stop attempting to make PG&E the fall guy for every wildfire that crops up. Continuous vegetation growth is a potential hazard that is impossible to control both on the ground and in the air, around all power lines. PG&E can only do so much and pre-burning the ground cover to keep it from igniting from downed power lines in high windstorms, is not one of them. In law, a contract based upon a pre-existing impossibility is unenforceable. Thus an alleged duty to remove all flammable vegetation from the vicinity of all above ground wiring, that continuously grows year after year, is a pre-existing impossibility. Negligence arises when someone reports vegetation as being a hazard at a particular location, and PG&E failing to respond to remove the vegetation.
