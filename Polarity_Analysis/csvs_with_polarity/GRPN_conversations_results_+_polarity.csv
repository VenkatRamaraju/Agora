Take a look at Goldman, JP Morgan Chase and others in the financial sector. All reported stellar numbers but their stocks fell after the news. The one point about GRPN's earnings release that has me going hmmmmm is the $300M stock repurchase program. I hope everyone on this board felt this was a BAD thing. Why, well the company had $135M remaining on it's previous repurchase plan and it chose not to utilize the funds before it expired on April 1. Why then would it be considered a good thing for the company to buy $300M during this program at higher stock prices? The company had plenty of time to repurchase stock at lower prices...again it chose not to. This is the thing that has driven me crazy about GRPN's leadership. They must feel another dip in price is on the horizon and want to lessen the float to account for the RSU's, options and other stock awards the buyback will offset. Something is not right here, at least with the repurchase program.",0.9961

71,"Take a good #$%$ at the Groupon website, they categorize their deals in five different sections. 1. Things to Do2. Beauty & Spas Good 3. Goods4. Hotels & Travel5. CouponAs virus fears roil the world, many people will choose to stay indoors, which means less outdoor group activities and travels. That is a big hit on the revenue Groupon getting from sections 1, 2 and 4. Knowing that Groupon is moving away from selling Goods, so section 3 will no longer bring in any revenues down the road. For section 5 (Coupon), this is a just place where other businesses $MSFT, $AMZN advertise their deals, and we can quietly often find those deals on business official websites, so those coupons are not even exclusive at all and haven?t said that, I doubt Groupon is getting significantly revenue from this section (5).

76,"Wharton marketing professor David Reibstein says “Groupon has a business model that made much more sense during a downturn in the economy,” he notes. “As the economy has picked up, there is less idle capacity and extra inventory, and there is less to be available"".That comment was made in 2017. How's the US GDP doing? dropped 32% last quarter.Is that a downturn in the economy? Guillermo thinks that a 32% drop with small business closing everywhere should be considered a downturn.How much was Groupon valued at the last downturn in terms of market cap? $6B. Today? $0.9B. So 7 x, 7 times is how much we can expect Groupon to grow. And one last point. All Groupon competitors went out of business or were bought out by Groupon (Livingsocial example). So maybe that $6B should be rounded to $10B. So yes 10 times today's price. Guillermo has told you. Now keep this little secret and keep buying because $100 a share will be the BASE for the next leg-up...shshshshhshs.",0.9508

Do you really think that GOOG's BOD would have easily allowed that $6 bil purchase? Without much scrutiny? No way, it would have been tough...by that I mean tougher than today. Groupon is stable. It is an authentic company earning money based on a business model that works. Sure further tweaking of said model would help ore in the way of profits. At the end of the day though, it has been streamlined to a smaller, more prosperous, country foot print...lowered its labor head count, restrained from making silly acquisitions like Order Up and Bread crumb any more. If the BOD of GOOG, were to be tasked with approving a deal now, vrs years ago, I am confident the odds are WAY HIGHER for approval.

Leonsis Theodore, Director, bought almost a million worth of shares on April 20, 2020. Founders, executives, and directors are under no obligation to buy shares with their own money so when they do, you should pay attention. They have an intimate knowledge of what's going on behind the scenes, so when they start spending their own money on shares, breaking news is coming...it's just a matter of when. Insider transactions are up 300% for a reason, so Short sellers beware.Analysts, even as a result of the pandemic, estimate GRPN's EPS next year to be 92.7%. Why you may ask? Analysts know that customer acquisition will be big business as the economy reopens and getting customers in the door is Groupon's specialty. Groupon looks like an ugly duckling now, but post-pandemic, it will grow into a swan without the need to merge or be acquired. Gross Margins are still over 53% and analysts' average price target is still $24.40 per share.

I am actually in the black on this dud. Not blacker because my clients said they'd kill me if I bought more when GRPN was testing the high 2's about 6 weeks ago; they were right in that there are better opportunities. I expected a comeback, but not this much this fast. A drink for all the longs today. As for the shorts....there was a ride from the 20's to here, but how much lower do you really think this is going?

Sure there has been the Living Social acquisition, ParkWhiz and GrubHub. The Groupon+ product presents a real opportunity. Quite a bit of yesterdays call focused on the international market. It seems like deja vu all over again. I would like to know what the new COO is bringing to the table since he is also now leading product development. Again, your comments are spot on.

984,"How is Q2 not going to be better than Q1 ?From report:'Throughout May, we saw sequential improvements in Local unit performance in both North America and International, as more cities reopened and reduced restrictions, which allowed merchants to begin to reopen their businesses. For example, in North America, Beauty & Wellness units increased 40%, albeit from a low level, in the second half of May vs. the first half May. This improvement was driven by trends in Florida, Texas, and California where restrictions have eased and we’re seeing customers purchase laser hair removal, botox, and hair treatment offerings. Overall, we are encouraged by trends like these that led to an 18% increase in North America Local units in May compared with April. In addition, May International Local units increased 30% versus April. June month-to-date consolidated Local units continue to improve sequentially compared with May.During the past few months, our Goods category has been a key asset, as consumer demand shifted to physical goods instead of local experiences. While we’ve seen strong year-over-year growth in Goods units globally during April and May, clearance and promotional activities drove lower unit economics, as we worked to sell through our owned inventory. These dynamics, together with a shift in category mix, unfavorably impacted Goods gross profit; that said, Goods gross profit sequentially improved in both April and May. In fact, Goods gross profit in April and May alone was greater than the total Goods gross profit we generated in the first quarter 2020. June month-to-date North America Goods unit growth remains steady compared with May, while International Goods unit growth has decelerated as consumer demand begins to shift to Local. Regarding cash flow trends during April and May, we generated free cash flow, which reflects both the positive impact of the cash preservation measures we took and the sequential improvements in operating performance. We ended May with $767 million in cash, including $200 million of borrowings under our revolver. We are also having ongoing discussions with our lenders under our revolving credit facility to obtain covenant relief. '",0.9989

It's amazing.If you look at fundamentals and compare Price to sales ratio for same category companies, like Ebay, Amazon, Yelp, as suggested by Google Finance, you find that a raio of 3 would be appropriate (as it was in 2014). Groupon is now sitting at a ratio of 0.75. Now, yes there are other parameters that must be considered besides Prices to Sales , but if the restructuring continues (as it has proven for the past 4 Qs), even maintaining sales of $3B as of now, Groupon should legitimately trade at a ratio of 2 (if not 3), or about 3 times today's price, that is $12-$15.

I emailed Groupon that night. The merchant apparently broke with the Groupon agreement; there was nothing in the fine print that allowed the merchant to not honor the Groupon. Groupon asked me details, whom I spoke to and when. I was issued a full refund and an apology. Incidentally, I have not seen that merchant on Groupon since.

1301,"Groupon has needed to continuously spend to acquire customers and build relationships with merchants, and such spending may limit Groupon’s profitability.If merchants become disenfranchised with its daily deals, they may either flock to Groupon’s competitors or push back against Groupon’s high take rate.Operating leverage, if any, is only for the short-term as Groupon will have to keep spending more to acquire new customers in order to increase transactions per and ROI for the merchant.Groupon’s business model makes it heavily dependent on daily deals, which is a major headwind. Since most of the offerings are consumer discretionary products, demand is heavily dependent on macroeconomic conditions. As redemptions are high and unused Groupons are low (revenues recognized upfront in daily deals, so an unused Groupon boosts the company’s revenues), the transition is expected to negatively impact the top line in the near term.Moreover, Groupon needs to continue spending on generating awareness about its offerings, which will drive up costs. Further, the company is likely to incur sizeable expenses owing to the ongoing restructuring activities, which can weigh down on its profitability. Additionally, aggressive investments for mobile, infrastructure and product development will continue to drive operating expenses higher.Despite growing billings, Groupon is yet to earn significant profits since its inception. Moreover, revenue growth has slowed down in the last couple of years. Furthermore, the new restructuring plan directly contradicts the company’s earlier business model per which itundertook rapid international expansion at the cost of profits.Intensifying competition remains a major headwind, which is also likely to hurt profitability. The company expects competition in eCommerce generally, and group buying in particular, to continue to increase. In addition, increasing presence of the social media companies in the e-commerce space can also pose serious challenges to Groupon’s recovery as merchants are increasingly adopting these platforms to sell their products.",0.9553

There results were good, the outlook equally as good and as a result the stock is on a tear. Furthermore there is a significant short squeeze taking place there. GRPN is similarly set up.

1416,"What to Expect from the 2018 Russell Rebalance TradesTraders Magazine Online News, June 7, 2018 Friday, June 22, will be one of the biggest – and busiest – trading days in the U.S. equity market, with turnover expected in the $300 to $400 billion range, as investment managers adjust their portfolios in accordance with the Russell Reconstitution, the annual change in the benchmark FTSE Russell investment indices. The large-cap Russell 1000, small/midcap Russell 2000 and broad Russell 3000 are among the most widely followed U.S. indices, with an estimated $1.2 trillion in assets tracking the benchmarks.Like what you see? Click here to sign up for Trader Magazine's weekly newsletter to get breaking news, exclusive features, the industry photo of the day and more.We project that this year’s reconstitution will lead to approximately $30 billion in net turnover, higher than last year’s $23 billion in turnover. Some highlights of this year’s trade: We are projecting 290 constituent changes to the Russell 3000 (excluding migrations) There are 7 projected additions to the Russell 1000 index, including Spotify (SPOT), AXA Equitable (EQH) and the second share class of CBS (CBS.A). There are also 2 likely deletions from the index, Ingersoll Rand (IR) and Delphi Technologies (DLPH) There are 164 projected additions to the Russell 2000 index including Zscaler (ZS) and Avaya (AVYA). 39 companies are expected to migrate from the Russell 1000 to the Russell 2000 and 43 companies will migrate from the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000 The largest sector inflows are expected into Healthcare (net $1.8 bln to buy across adds and deletes), where we anticipate 66 additions to Russell 2000 (40% of all Russell 2000 additions) along with 32 deletions Some of the biggest expected trades include Spotify ($519m to buy), Jazz Pharma (JAZZ, $375m to buy), Ingersoll-Rand ($692m to sell) and Ensco (ESV, $293m to sell) Depending on index membership, we estimate that firms benchmarked to Russell indexes own more than 10% of the total float shares outstanding in some of these names. As a result, additions or deletions from the index can generate significant price impact and create a substantial liquidity event. These liquidity events make the Russell Reconstitution a noteworthy occurrence even for many traders who are not benchmarked to the indices.While a substantial portion of the trading takes place into and at the close on rebalance day (June 22), we would expect trading activity to rise in the weeks ahead of the Russell, particularly as traders reposition themselves ahead of the S&P and FTSE index rebalances on June 15.",0.9874

Companies from a variety of sectors showing strength during this latest market run. I'm surprised by the apathy the leads at GRPN have shown preceding and since earnings. We all understand the strategy to focus on markets that will deliver a profitable return. We all understand they are working to streamline processes so each market doesn't function in a disparate manner. What I don't understand is how the company is looking at the bigger picture.How is the company looking at partnerships? Firms such as TWTR, FB, SNAP etc are just a few of the companies that could change the dynamics of this company in a big way. What about the Comcast investment? What has Angelakis brought to the table? How can GRPN & CMCSA find mutually beneficial synergies?What about the BABA investment? BABA owns over 33M shares of GRPN. They have held their position for over a year now. What has Williams and team done to leverage this investment to make it beneficial for both parties. Does anyone think BABA will continue to sit still over the next 6-9 months with a depreciating stock price. They have $100M invested. I know this may be small potatoes for a company of BABA's size however Jack Ma is a proven winner and I don't believe he likes to lose...ever!Lastly what is the company doing to leverage the findings from the start ups founded by Lefkofsky and Keywell. Lefkofsky is the COB and Keywell a board member. GRPN needs to explore what opportunities exist between these companies.The continued focus on the operations is important. It is just a component of the bigger picture. Can Williams and the rest of the leadership team balance more than one thing on their plate. So far that answer is NO if you evaluate solely on the stock price and GRPN's latest quarterly results.",0.9964

Why is this stock so heavily shorted? On a positive note Williams and Randolfi continue to hold on to their shares. They have not made an open market transaction for over 1.5 years. More institutions were invested as of 12/31, over 62% of available shares. This stock has to demonstrate a consistent pattern of reasonable growth in FCF, EBITDA and cash from operations. Not to mention overall sales and bottom line performance. If you believe in Williams then ride the cycles. I suspect it will be a choppy ride. I believe the stock will see the 3's again. This pattern is quite similar to 2016. The one thing for sure about GRPN is history does repeat itself. There will be swings than can net investors good returns while conversely causing others to lose significant $$$. I will be a buyer once should the stock fall back to the $3.50 range.

I hope you are adding call options because Guillermo has.Guillermo wants to bring your attention to market cap.GRPN in the last 10 years had a market cap of $2B with spikes at $3.8B (after the big recession) or about 4 times today's market cap.We can say now GRPN is running with one cylinder (goods) while 'experiences' (the other cylinder) are just starting. Already now it should be valued probably like $1.3-1.5B because experiences are already moving and goods are going at full power, which translated to PPS should be about $50 a share. What a coincidence the number Guillermo has been talking about for months!!! Then once we go full power full power on both cylinders then we should get 4 times from here so about $140-$150 a share (again, a number Guillermo has mentioned before). This without particular synergies (that will develop in the next couple of years), new lines of businesses (that will develop in the next couple of years), new partnerships (that will develop in the next couple of years)...that is why the target price will be actually $200-$300.

Maybe marketers at those companies already realize Groupon has staying power and a very positive brand image with upper income urban mom's, and is gaining momentum nationally.

The grips are high margin, like $90 each yet his cost is $20.3) An oil change place owner informed me that they barely break even on a Groupon oil change. However, as in other examples, he then proceeded to tell me he sells a lot of wipers for vehicles. Also, an occasional brake job or other related car repairs.

Like Groupon is 5 times undervalued compared to Amazon!!! (90/23 or 3.60/.72...)that means that if Groupon were trading at 5x $4.00 = $20 would be as fairly valued as Amazon is...So, based on that, a $10 price per share in 2017 is nothing crazy, if the company confirms revenues and cost controlling. That would also justify the recent 30% stock appreciation. Obviously the first stop would be $5-$6, but then we could head to $10 by Q4. I invite everyone to check with their brokerage on Groupon performance under the current CEO. He has always beat on earnings and revenues...so a pretty good record.

By being a marketplace for local experiences, Groupon thinks that it will be able to reinvent itself and return to profitability after years of sales decline.

Does GRPN's CEO have the same panache as Zuckerberg, Dorsey, Spiegel etal? Not even close. Williams is confident yet reclusive, focused yet obscure and most of all he is bland. As a marketer the messages his company delivers are benign and confusing. His approach to new products and partnerships has been reluctance and overly cautious. The BOD is made up of some highly influential executives that can open doors and promote a new for GRPN. I believe this is lacking. As a former executive with Amazon, Williams has yet to bring the same disruptive approach to GRPN. I expected more as he learned the business during his stint as COO and as a CEO he continues to act as an operator versus a visionary. His strategy is sound but limited. It offers a slow plodding growth opportunity that can and will be disrupted if new products and partnerships are not introduced. I am not attacking Williams per se, just disappointed based on the expectations I had with the company's direction. I believe the company missed a huge opportunity by not touting a broader relationship with BABA. What has Angelakis and the Comcast venture capital relationship done for the growth of GRPN? This is the most disturbing thing with Williams management style. His inability to make noise in the marketplace with the tools he has at his disposal.I will be in through earnings. My expectations are low. In fact it wouldn't surprise me if they miss and restate their strategy is on course.

The stock trades at 7.0x 2019 AEBITDA vs. comps at 14.0x and the aforementioned concern lacks appreciation for the business model shift from agency to broker (first- to third-party) and economics tied to Groupon+. As Groupon+ grows (we estimate 4% of 2Q transactions), transaction tracking services will not capture the data accurately.

The cancellation policy is 4 days in advance, fine.My friend arrived from Georgia, visiting Colorado for the first time in years and the altitude immediately made him sick. We didn't go up the mountain for fear of his altitude sickness getting worse. I called the hotel at Beaver Run and they said that it was up to Groupon to administer any refund and that I needed to talk to someone at Groupon, because no one at the hotel would be able to help me. So I called your customer service line and got a Very Helpful response from Timeka. She said that she couldn't process the refund but she would escalate it to a supervisor and that I should see a refund in my account in 3 to 5 business days. I thanked her for her help and the phone conversation was a quick one, because Timeka was able to ""resolve"" my issue so quickly.In the future, please be open and honest with your customers. Their time and money is just as valuable (if not more valuable when considering the business to customer relationship and what a business is without a customer) as your time and money. So don't lie to your customers just to get a problem off of your plate.Whereas a simple helpful response with honest follow through might have earned you a customer for life, your incredible failure and lack of attention in this instance has alienated a customer instead. I will be making an EFFORT not to use your services in the future. Moreover, I will be letting all of my friends and family know that Groupon is not an honest company and that their hard earned money is best put to use with other service providers. Your service rep was misleading and dis-honest and it looks bad on your organization.I am sorry for the lengthy post, but I was very upset by this process and the manner in which the blame for my request denial was pawned off to a third party. This is a micro-cosmic view of the state of our country nowadays. All we do is push blame on someone else. Own it and bring some integrity back to this nation.

My suggestion would be that Groupon make each customer that has not placed an order in, say, the last 6-8 months AN OFFER THEY CAN’T REFUSE , even if there is 0 gross profit for Groupon for that transaction.

3596,"Groupon clearly is a pandemic loser as indicated by operating losses that grew five-fold in Q1 2020 YoY over Q1 2019. Since they derive a large chunk of revenues from small businesses, the restart narrative may initially appear to benefit the Company. However, small businesses that have been shut down during isolation mandates would think twice about further discounting products and services as loss leaders through Groupon to get the limited foot traffic in the doors as mandated by regional jurisdictions. While stay-at-home mandates get lifted, social distancing policies will continue to remain in effect for the foreseeable future which results in capacity limitations of up to 50% for stores and restaurants. Groupon’s model is flawed as numerous businesses have identified customers that only engage when Groupon coupons are available. They are conditioned only to pay a discounted price and shun paying full price, which is the opposite outcome that businesses originally anticipated to get new customers in the door to stay. It’s comical how Groupon attempts to give the façade of sophisticated restructuring which is mostly layoffs and furloughs. It’s typical smoke and mirrors attempt to improve the perception of a bulk discounting business model with tremendous competition and few barriers to entry. Reverse splits are usually a sign of desperation and a nail in the coffin for shareholders. From local mailers to Yelp (NASDAQ: YELP) , the competition is endless. Groupon investors may want to unwind their positions while shares are still trading on hubris and savvy experienced traders may consider playing the downward spiral.",0.7729

Those 20% NASDAQ drops will be great chances to accumulate.3) Small caps (like GRPN) will do great. As an AVERAGE the sector will DOUBLE in the next 2 years.

With a 50 multiplier we are still talking of $90 a share...In other words if Groupon continues executing as in the second quarter a valuation over $150 a share is what is coming for GRPN, AUTOPILOT!Now if EBITDA goes to $250M as estimated, we might finally reach a decent market cap of $10B, something that analysts had estimated following the big recession (2011-12). $10B would translate into a projected $300-$400 price per share.

Groupon has been desperately pivoting strategies ineffectively, displaying poor management capability, which we saw with the goods business.Groupon has illustrated an inability to retain users with the number of active users dropping every quarter for the past 7 consecutive quarters. This is a dying business, and you can see this when going on the app. I live in Chicago and had once been an avid Groupon user, but frankly, the quality of deals the platform offers has gone downhill over the last two years.Some may wonder how much further this stock can fall, considering it lost 95% of its value since its IPO in 2011. This company has proven its inability to compete in this saturated space, and management’s attempts to revive Groupon’s top has only caused more damage for the company.

After trying to get in touch with the Chinese Merchant through a link on Groupon's order site, they tell me it'll arrive by June 5th. Still no product so I try to get in touch with Groupon itself since THEY are who I purchased the product from. Low and behold, Groupon's Customer service is a chat line with India. All she kept typing was you have to gin touch with the Chinese Vendor. So here it is June 14th and I still do not have my anti-virus program and Groupon is uncontactable. i told her I wanted to cancel the order since it's two weeks late and she said ""she couldn't do that"". In their fine print, Groupon claims that once you receive this order physically, it non returnable. Is THIS the type of company you want to invest your money in? I play the market too, but invest only in companies that have REAL customer service lines and are reputable. Maybe, just MAYBE, one of the Groupon execs sees this and a light bulb gets turned on. I am now contacting my credit card company to dispute the Groupon charge. Oh yeah, I'm cancelling my Groupon Account since I have found how they ""really do business""......

Its no secret that grpn is out of cash, have no strategic business model for survival, fired its last ceo very recently. Its looking for a golden parachute to get a bailout or its going to crash hard. The reverse split was a sign and a very strong message about its short term future. It is signaling that this star has lost all of its fuel and is about to die soon. A reverse split is what struggling companies often do as a last ditch effort to stay afloat before it collapses within itself. Its a legal tatic for the insiders to sell off secretly by using money from new investors or the ones that still hold on to their positions, before the company eventually goes into bankruptcy. All the while the pumpers will fill this board with false messages of hope and false pipe dreams on how this stock will rocket one day, they get paid to this dirty work to prevent existing investors from selling their positions and lure unsuspecting new buyers. Ofcourse the unknowing investors will fail to see these warning signs due to tremendous confusion driven by the pumpers on this board. There will be lot of attacks and downticks on this type of message also.

4667,Exciting times for Groupon. I can't believe so many still on the sidelines. Throw out all of the #$%$ about why they can't succeed and look at the improvements and vision of a company here to stay. GO GRPN!,0.6182
4668,buy buy buy,0.3739
4669,The last 3 days GRPN is down 5.21% and the Nasdaq is only down .87% things will even out eventually. I imagine the shorts thought GRPN was going to miss earnings and/ or revenue (or why would they be short?) The analysts all though they would break even. The bulls thought they would make .01-.03 cents so they pretty much beat everyone’s expectations and raised guidance. I’m not sure what else they need to do for the stock to go up. Hopefully more upgrades in the way.,0.8794

4673,"GRPN has executed well on profitability. However, for the stock to take off, it needs a way to generate sone excitement. Groupon+ may ultimately do the job, but I was thinking more that the company should work to develop some original content, both on the Goods and Local sides. Netflix would not be where it was if it had not started to develop its own shows. It’s been Netflix’s originals what has generated excitement for them. If Groupon could develop products exclusive to them, the impact might be substantial.",0.9596
4674,slow and steady,0.3661
4675,Groupon has no consideration towards their investors ... turning down a 6 billion dollar offer and basically watching this company dwindle to less than half the value is a disgrace. What effort are they actually putting in to build this back up to where it should be ?,0.0111
