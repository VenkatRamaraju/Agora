Last night it was the idea of reopening combined with some good news about the Gilead drug which I still can't pronounce or spell. But, I'd think ""reopening"" would actually INCREASE the demand for Clorox disinfectants. Businesses have to disinfect too going forward. Also, how many know that Clorox owns Brita, the water pitcher/filter company? I've turned to Brita to ease up on my use of bottled water.",0.9431

They had many varieties there, and some with 20 billion cultures, some for older people, etc etc. So I find one I think will work, and its in a box 2 1/2 inches square, and 4 1/2 inches high. It looked like there would be a 90 day or 120 day supply. So I get home, open the bottle, and walah, there are only 30 capsules. A 30 day supply. The bottle was mostly empty, except for the lower quarter inch. These 30 capsules would fit in a pack of gum. But they put it in an oversized box. I'm just glad they didn't say ""contents may settle due to shipping."" But come on. The packaging used is definitely misleading. It would be akin to putting a pint of cough syrup in a gallon jug.

We believe habits around disinfecting are changing for the long term, and that Clorox's sales may NOT decline in the high-single digits in the second half of fiscal 2021 (when prior-year comps get hard) as the consensus is projecting.""The firm assigns a price target of $256 on Clorox vs. the average sell-side PT of $194.19.",0.8907

You cant even find baby wipes because people are buying it to clean, so what do you think is left for clorox wipes.Clorox had just expanded their production capacity, check their latest report. They basically got new production plants and machinery, so this crisis hit when they were ready to go.In supply chain, when demand increases and factories work 24/7, the profit margin increases too. They probably are paying people overtime and its not making a dent.Revenue up, profits up, cash on hand up, less debt. People that are saying this should be sold because its expensive are insane.

Here's my thinking on how Clorox is in a win-win: If the shutdown is extended then the demand is there for people to buy the disinfectants, which you can't find on the shelves, so that's is the win that everyone is focused on. But, what I feel that everyone else is overlooking is that as the re-opening starts, there will be more demand for their products. An example of this was that I recently went to a clothing store to finally buy some needed shirts. At the counter, the cashier would spray disinfectant spray after each sale on the counter. Whether you think that is overkill or not (I think it was because she was wiping down an area that was not touched by the customer nor was it breathed on because of the plastic shield on the counter and the mask worn by the customer) it shows that this is what companies will have to do in order to keep customers coming in and not be afraid of catching the virus. Now imagine a fully opened economy and the lingering fear of getting sick and every cashier wiping down every counter after every sale. And this extends past the department store and into all other businesses (think restaurants, bars, anything for that matter). That has to be an even better situation for Clorox than what we have now. I guess the only down side to this would be if they could keep up with the extra demand.",0.7174

728,"Hi. I would like to have a real discussion and i am curious as to thoughts on the following. I wrote this on Seeking Alpha to a bearish author (Chris Lau) who didn't respond:1. You indicate that Wipes etc are being hoarded and there will be a demand crash. Except: people are using Clorox wipes and sprays every single day and there are very few homes that aren’t almost out. People are trying right now to buy more and can’t and therefore they actually have unfulfilled demand, not stockpiles2. The best epidemiologists are saying that without total lockdown we will be passing back and forth the virus for many months. Therefore people will need to maintain a high level disinfection going forward correct?3. People point to China - however China is operating today in a much more locked down mode. They are continuously disinfecting, wear masks, limiting travel etc. therefore- even in places that are “under control” they are using a high level of cleaners/disinfectants correct?4. The entire supply chain has zero Clorox products for retail. I believe it is all being diverted to our hospitals and first responders (who deserve and need it! Thank you to all of them for their heroic efforts). I just checked every major retailer and all have zero. How long will it take for Clorox to both fill all this unfulfilled retail demand And rebuild supply chain inventory?5. Traumatic situations like this often change consumer behavior for years. How long do you think people’s behavior for using Clorox products will be changed?6. Clorox is a big fixed cost production platform. Big industrial plants are much more profitable when they can be operated 24*7. Shouldn’t we expected improved margins for quarters if not years to come?7. Before this mess, Clorox has to advertise and discount to sell. For the foreseeable future they now have the best brand recognition in the US right? Shouldn’t we expect higher free cash flow with less discounting and less advertising?8. I am not 100% sure on the impact of lower oil prices so while i have heard it will help Clorox i really don’t have any analysis to identify what it might be. Any thoughts?9. One of my best friends father just passed from coronavirus 2 days ago. He was treated with 3 different experimental drugs and tragically none helped. Sadly i don’t see any perfect treatment, hopefully we will at least get some help for high risk patients. Do you see a super impactful treatment option in the shorter term?Would love to understand your bearish stance vs these points.Full disclosure i am long Clorox in my personal account but value thoughtful input and discourse",0.9926

Cat litter might have more than usual sales as well since people will be at home more and pay attention to their cats.Only charcoals sales are down.Then of course have cleaning products with a demand that goes beyond their production 24/7. Two months of products flying off the shelves.Currently Clorox has 33 products that are confirmed by the FDA to kill the coronavirus. These are sold out from March to December, easily.

The first characteristic is: Does the company own an enduring product or service with a strategic position within their industry? And for Clorox, over 80% of their sales are generated from brands that have a number-one or number-two market share position. Clorox’s ability to consistently deliver strong results over the years is based on its strategy of focusing on categories and markets where it has an advantage and where larger companies have mostly chosen to refrain from operating.""",0.9793

1063,"Heads up: The dollar index DX-Y.NYB has been going down since April and is getting to the lowest point since it bottomed out and headed up in early 2018. Right about this time, there was a significant sell off of the Dow. The reason this is important to we CLX holders is that CLX is such a great dividend stock that it can be thought of as a bond substitute when interest rates are very low, like they've been since the Covid-19 pandemic started. But when the dollar went way down in early 2018, Treasury bond yields took off because, I assume, Treasuries sold off in response to the declining dollar. If that happens again, the gap between the risk free rate of return (Treasuries) and the return on dividend paying stocks gets narrower, potentially making dividend stocks less attractive for those seeking mainly income. In other words, there's a chance that CLX might have some turbulence ahead which has nothing directly to do with CLX. I will be watching the dollar, Treasuries, and what our Fed and government may try to do, if anything to halt the slide of the dollar.

1070,CLX has put up one bad quarter after another for the past year (you can read my posts after each quarter). But the stock has not been penalized as management keeps spinning the bad results and/or putting out totally unrealistic guidance. Now they had to take back that unrealistic guidance but maybe they hit some target which now allows them to get fatter bonuses or maybe they sold lots of their own stock. I don't know if this is the case but it wouldn't surprise me one but. What is the incentive to lie to shareholders if you know you cannot meet the targets in the long run? So for those asking why the stock went down so much of a slight miss? It is because the stock was and is massive over valued.
