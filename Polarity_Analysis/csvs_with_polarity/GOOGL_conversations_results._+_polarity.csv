The company benefited from ""strong"" e-commerce trends through much of the holiday shopping season and there is improving visibility for digital advertising in 2021, Sebastian tells investors in a research note, citing positive end-of-year channel checks. Alphabet also faces easier year-over-year comparisons next year, and should benefit from an expected recovery in travel, recreation and automotive ads, says the analyst. He sees a ""favorable outlook for 2021."" Further, Sebastian does not expect ""game changing"" penalties to be put on the company from regulation.

GOOGL division Google finalized the purchase of New York-based Chelsea Market from Jamestown LP, an Atlanta-based real estate and asset management company, for $2.4 billion.The deal, announced in early February 2018, is likely to strengthen Google’s footprint in New York and will expand its business. The deal provides the company with the ownership rights of a huge office building. Reportedly, it is the second most expensive purchase of a single building in the history of New York.Chelsea Market, formerly known as Nabisco Cookie factory, is a 1.19-million square foot complex adjacent to the Google’s New York headquarter. The building has a shopping mall and a food court which is the center of attraction for most of the local visitors and tourists.The food hall will continue to operate and will be managed by Jamestown.Coming to the share price movement, the shares of Google have returned 28.9% over a year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 17.7%.",0.9914

44,"I am a GOOG long for 10+ years. I sold my options and I have to take the tax impact. I am concerned about the valuation. The earnings growth is 15-16%. GOOG can no longer claim a PE of 25. At the PE of 20, GOOG needs to earn 50 dollars this year to justify this 1150 type of value. I do not see that. Even if GOOG earns 50 dollars next year, the earnings growth may slow down even more. I do not see the stock go up much unless there is a way GOOG can squeeze the margin. GOOG grew from 800 to 1150 in a year. But the earnings growth slowed down 25 to 20 to 15.

112,"India opens antitrust case against Google over its payments appIndia’s antitrust watchdog has opened an investigation into Google for allegedly abusing the dominant position of its app store to promote its payments service in the world’s second largest internet market.In its Monday announcement (PDF) about opening an antitrust case against Google, Indian watchdog Competition Commission of India (CCI) said it would review claims of whether the Android maker prominently promotes Google Pay during the setup of an Android smartphone (and whether phone vendors have a choice to avoid this); and if Play Store’s billing system is designed “to the disadvantage of both i.e. apps facilitating payment through UPI, as well as users.”The informant, who has not been identified, alleged that in addition to Google Play Store’s billing system favoring Google Pay app, in-app purchases for apps downloaded through Play Store are also mandated to support Google Pay service “if they want to be listed on the Play Store” and they are required to pay a “high commission” for that.The informant also alleged that Google “unfairly” skews the search results on the Play Store in favor of Google Pay app over others — though CCI is not investigating this claim citing not enough evidence to support them. Google “rigs its feature app lists such as ‘Editor’s Choice Apps’, ‘User Choice Apps’ and ‘Top Free apps’ … demonstrating clear bias in favor of its own app; by manipulating the search advertisements algorithm on the Play Store in favour of Google Pay.”“The informant pointed out similarities between the conducts of Apple in Europe and Google in India i.e. like Apple (as set out in the Press Release of EC), as a mandatory requirement for listing on the Play Store, Google requires the app developers to exclusively use Google Play Store’s payment system and Google Play In-App Billing for charging users who purchase apps on the Play Store or buy goods/services from inside an app (i.e. IAP), and further like Apple, Google charges app developers a 30% commission for allowing them to use the Play Store’s payment system and Google Play In-App Billing,” the Indian watchdog said, which has directed its director general to complete the investigation within 60 days.",0.9946

Google exhausted all appeals and in 30 days approximately the USPTO will issue the new patent upholding all 78 claims.

If it’s not trying to poach buyers of cloud computing services from Amazon, then it’s trying to dent Amazon’s e-commerce dominance.With the support of Google, traditional retailers such as Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) are making more online sales, with their online sales having grown 33% and 28% year-over-year, respectively, in the latest quarter.￼Google’s threat to Amazon’s e-commerce business is growing. According to the latest research reports by Canalys and Strategy Analytics, Google’s star is rising rapidly in the smart speaker market.Google overtook Amazon in the smart speaker marketEstimates by Strategy Analytics show that Google shipped 2.4 million smart speakers and more than doubled its share of the global smart speaker market to 26.5% in the first quarter. In contrast, Amazon doubled its smart speaker shipments, but its share of the market nearly halved to 43.6% from 81.8% a year earlier.On its part, Canalys estimates that Google beat Amazon to become the world’s top smart speaker company in the first quarter, as we can see in the chart above. Google’s rise can partly be attributed to retailers prioritizing its speakers over Amazon’s because retailers view Amazon as a competitor.",0.9783

176,"Inside the Google-Facebook Ad Deal at the Heart of a Price-Fixing LawsuitLawmakers have called for an investigation into the tech giants’ contract, dubbed ‘Jedi Blue,’ which allegedly allowed for auction riggingGoogle allegedly gave Facebook special terms and access to its ad server, a lawsuit brought by 10 Republican state attorneys general saysState attorneys general said in a lawsuit earlier this month that a 2018 business agreement between two digital advertising giants, Facebook Inc. and Google, was an illegal price-fixing deal. Lawmakers are calling for further investigation. The companies say it was above board.The Wall Street Journal viewed part of a recent unredacted draft version of the lawsuit, which elaborates on allegations in the redacted complaint filed in a Texas federal district court.Ten Republican attorneys general, led by Texas’ Ken Paxton, say Google gave Facebook special terms and access to its ad server, a ubiquitous tool for allocating advertising space across the web. This and other conduct by Google, they allege in the final lawsuit, harms competition and deprives “advertisers, publishers and consumers of improved quality, greater transparency, increased output and/or lower prices.”Crucial to the backdrop of the Google-Facebook deal was the advertising industry’s movement toward an ad-sales method called header bidding.Header bidding helped website publishers circumvent Google’s exchanges for buying and selling ads across the web. The exchange auctions ad space to the highest bidder during the split second it takes a webpage to load.Header bidding allowed the publishers to directly solicit bids from multiple ad exchanges at once, leading to more favorable prices for publishers. Google worried a big rival might embrace header bidding, such as the Facebook Audience Network ad service, or FAN, cracking Google’s profitable monopoly over ad tools, the states allege. “Need to fight off the existential threat posed by header bidding and FAN,” Google advertising executive Chris LaSala wrote in an internal document outlining 2017 priorities, according to the draft complaint.In March 2017, Facebook publicly endorsed header bidding. Google approached Facebook and in September 2018 reached the digital advertising agreement, the states allege. The draft lawsuit says Google code-named it “Jedi Blue.” In December 2018, Facebook announced it was joining an advertising program, “Open Bidding,” that Google offers as an alternative to header bidding.TERMS OF THE ‘JEDI BLUE’ CONTRACTThese are some of the alleged stipulations in the Google-Facebook contract, according to a recent, unredacted draft of the states’ lawsuit viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Google says it is common to match users through trackers known as cookies, and it publicly offers that service to other buyers. • Facebook pays Google a 5% to 10% transaction fee. (Google says this fee is standard.) • Google helps Facebook recognize mobile and web users. • Facebook bids to show ads to 90% of users it recognizes. • Facebook has 300 millisecond “timeout” to recognize user and bid. Some other participants have shorter, 160 millisecond timeout. • Facebook is locked into spending $500 million annually starting in the fourth year.In return, the states allege in the final suit, Google gave Facebook special treatment. Among other things, it allowed Facebook to send bids directly into Google’s widely used software, known as an ad server, the draft lawsuit says.Typically, bidders go through an exchange, which sends the winner on to Google’s server. By circumventing the middleman, Facebook could face less competition and save money. Google barred Facebook from discussing pricing terms publicly, the draft says.Google also told Facebook which ad opportunities were likely produced by bots rather than by consumers, and it didn’t charge Facebook for those impressions, according to the draft suit. Other auction participants asked Google for the same information but were denied it, the final lawsuit says, redacting the information in question.Any bidder without that information would be at a disadvantage, said Adam Heimlich, CEO of ad technology company Chalice Custom Algorithms LLC. “It’s like saying CarMax has the ability to tell when they have a junky used car, and they don’t tell you,” he said. Mr. Heimlich accused Google of harming competition at a Senate hearing this year.Unlike other types of antitrust cases, which can require complex market analysis and the sussing out of business motivations, agreements to fix prices or rig auctions are inherently illegal, said Harry First, a New York University antitrust law professor who was once the head of New York state’s antitrust enforcement bureau.“The only defense that a court will hear is, ‘We didn’t do it,’ ” he said.",0.9834

It should copy it instead,” Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a blog post Thursday.Microsoft waded into the dispute down under earlier this month, when Google threatened to block its search engine in Australia over the proposed law, or “news media bargaining code,” as it’s called. Smith said at the time that Microsoft would never make such a threat.Facebook has also warned that it would consider blocking Australians from sharing news on its platform if the law passes.Smith used the occasion in his post to dive deeper on threats to democracy and journalism and the erosion of traditional news sources at the hands of the internet and social media. Microsoft also touted its MSN licensing agreements with 1,200 publishers worldwide, generating $1 billion in revenue for those publishers since 2014.“The legislation will redress the economic imbalance between technology and journalism by mandating negotiations between these tech gatekeepers and independent news organizations,” Smith said. “The goal is to provide the news organizations with compensation for the benefit derived by tech gatekeepers from the inclusion of news content on their platforms.”",0.9732

356,"Australia rebukes Google for blocking local contentThe Australian government has urged Google to focus on paying for Australian content instead of blocking it.After media reports said Australian news websites were not showing up in searches, Google confirmed it was blocking the sites for a small number of users.The search engine said it was conducting experiments to determine the value of its service to Australian news outlets.Google, Facebook and other tech companies are fighting the Australian government over plans to make them pay for news content.Google said the tests affect about 1% of Australian users, and will be finished by February.“The digital giants should focus on paying for original content, not blocking it. That’s my message to those digital giants,” said Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg.The big tech firms have been resisting legislation which will force them to negotiate with Australian news outlets over payment for the content which appears on their platforms.If the parties are unable to reach an agreement, a government-appointed arbitrator will decide for them.The law is currently being debated by Australia’s Senate, and is expected to be voted on early this year.Google and Facebook have called the rules unfair and suggested they would force them to limit their offerings in the country.The bill also covers Australia's two public broadcasters ABC and SBS, and requires Google and Facebook to share user data of news stories with their publishers.“That is a world-leading scheme that we are putting in place. It has been acknowledged not just by regulatory agencies but by other governments around the world,” said Mr Frydenberg.Google argues that its search services would be worse under the change.It has rolled out an extensive advertising campaign in Australia, arguing the laws would be damaging.Australia’s media proprietors see things differently. Australian print media has seen a 75% decline in advertising revenue since 2005, the government said.Many Australian news outlets have shut down or cut jobs in recent years as a result.",-0.4803

394,"What Biden means for Big Tech—and Google in particularTechnology policy is not a priority for the president-elect, but the government's lawsuit against Google will continue.Throughout his campaign to win the White House, president-elect Joe Biden has been relatively quiet about the technology industry. In a revealing January 2020 interview with The New York Times editorial board, Biden said that he wanted to revoke Section 230; suggested that he disagreed with how friendly the Obama administration became with Silicon Valley; and referred to tech executives as “little creeps” who displayed an “overwhelming arrogance.” But internet companies have also been one of his campaign’s top 10 donors, technology industry insiders joined his campaign, and incoming vice president Kamala Harris has long-standing ties to Silicon Valley as the former district attorney in San Francisco. Aside from expanding Broadband access, and its role in climate change and the coronavirus response, however, technology may not be high on Biden’s list of priorities, says Gigi Sohn, who served as counselor to Federal Communications Commission chairman Tom Wheeler during the Obama Administration.Biden suggested that he disagreed with how friendly the Obama administration became with Silicon Valley… but internet companies have been one of his campaign’s top donors.She says he’s going to inherit other major issues that will—and should—take up his administration’s early focus. “We could talk about the evils of the internet, but you still need it,” she says. “I think making sure that every American has access to affordable broadband is more important [than regulating the Internet], because they need that to live right now...to work...to learn...and to see a doctor.”On Sunday morning, less than 24 hours after the first network called the presidential election for Joe Biden, the president-elect had published a transition website detailing his administration’s agenda. It had four priority areas: covid-19, economic recovery, racial equity, and climate change. Technology was mentioned briefly, but with a focus on expanding broadband internet, rather than regulation of Big Tech companies. So what will tech regulation look like under a Biden presidency? It’s not clear, but there are several areas worth paying attention to. The Google lawsuit will continueIn late October, the Department of Justice filed its long-awaited antitrust lawsuit against Google. While experts are divided on the strength of the lawsuit itself, they agree that it will continue under a Biden presidency. If anything, some argue that it will likely be strengthened, especially with several states including New York expected to file their own lawsuit, which may be combined with the DoJ’s effort.Additionally, the Biden administration has “the ability to amend that complaint,” says Charlotte Slaiman, the director of competition policy at the advocacy organization Public Knowledge. “There are actually more competition concerns around Google that could be included in a broader complaint,” she says, including potential anti-competitive practices in display advertising. Meanwhile, Andrew Sullivan, the President & CEO of the Internet Society, says that he is “hopeful” that a Biden presidency would mean “fewer attempts to interfere in the direct operation of the internet.” This did not mean a repudiation of antitrust regulation, he added. “There are many Democrats who would like those companies to be broken up too, so we might not see a big change in policy.” Refocusing the debate on Section 230 Biden has spoken out about the need to revoke Section 230, the section of the Communications Decency Act which shields internet companies from liability for the content that they host.",0.9987

415,"U.S. states prepare second antitrust lawsuit against Google for DecemberWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. states plans to file an antitrust lawsuit against Google as early as next month, according to two people briefed on the matter, potentially beating a more widely anticipated lawsuit from a different group of states led by Texas.The pending legal actions follow an antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Justice Department against Alphabet’s Google in October.The bipartisan group -- made up of Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah -- is sometimes referred to as the Colorado/Nebraska group and has said it planned to combine its case with the federal government’s.Google has broadly denied wrongdoing in response to the government’s lawsuit and other probes, and the company said that its search engine and other products are dominant because consumers prefer them.Two people briefed on the matter said the Colorado/Nebraska group planned to file their lawsuit around mid-December, with one of the people saying a filing was expected in federal district court.Texas led a group of attorneys general from 50 states and territories which announced a probe of Google in September 2019. Fast forward a year, and Texas is leading a group focused on online advertising technology while the Colorado/Nebraska group has a broader probe under way.The Texas effort may be slowed by turmoil in the state attorney general’s office.One source pointed to disruptions after recent media reports said the FBI was investigating accusations that Attorney General Ken Paxton abused his office to help a political donor. Several of Paxton’s aides, who had become whistleblowers, resigned or were fired, including people who were key to the Google investigation.Texas has been aiming to find replacements, and it has promoted Shawn Cowles to be the deputy attorney general for civil litigation. But the turnover has led to delays.The Texas attorney general’s office could not be reached for comment.The Colorado/Nebraska group states’ broader inquiry contrasts with the Justice Department’s relatively narrow lawsuit, which focused on Google’s efforts to build and retain its dominance in search and its search advertising business.",0.987

And the company has discussed plans to eventually list publicly, spinning out from its parent Alphabet Inc., according to people familiar with the plans.But Waymo must first quell concerns about a recent string of departures that have raised questions about its strategy and the size of its lead in the field.Since February, Waymo has lost six key executives in rapid succession, including its chief executive officer, chief financial officer and several key lieutenants. John Krafcik, the outgoing CEO, had telegraphed his departure to some although it surprised many at Waymo and others at Alphabet, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks were private. Waymo appointed two executives as co-CEOs and is recruiting a new CFO.These management shuffles come as Alphabet is tightening spending for costlier projects outside of Google. Waymo, born as a moonshot inside the search giant over a decade ago, has long been considered the standard bearer in autonomous driving and last year launched a ride-sharing service with driverless cars in Phoenix. Yet critics have pointed out the company hasn’t delivered on pledges to bring that service to more cities and settled on a commercial model.“Waymo is stumbling and bumbling,” said Raj Rajkumar, professor of robotics at Carnegie Mellon University. “Right now it looks like it’s moving toward nothing.”",0.9119

607,"WHY SENS WILL DOMINATE CGM MARKET IN 5 YEARS. DXCOM and ABBOTT External CGMs will become obsolete. The reason I am investing in Sens from a CPA and a husband of a T1D.The market: according to the ADA 1 in 3 Americans will be diagnosed with some type of diabetes by 2050. Not all diabetics will require a CGM but the T1Ds and insulin dependent type 2s will.The competition: the two main competitors are Dexcom G6 and Freestyle Libre. I intentionally left out the Medtronic guardian because in my opinion it is not of the same quality. Dexcom and Libre are basically competing with the same or similar product. A 10-15 day exterior sensor. SENS is differentiated from the competition in that it is the only implantable long-term CGM. Even if it doesn’t dethrone the competition there are going to be diabetics that want something different.The Company: Sens just signed a deal with Asensia which owns the contour next. A glucometer that diabetics use. In my opinion they saw the writing on the wall with CGM technology and needed to get aboard or they would drown. SENS was struggling and they found this. This deal offers Sens a superior distribution and commercialization channel. To get product to the people.The pipeline: CEO Goodnow said the 180 day sensor will be approved in the US at the End of Q2 due to delays at the FDA. They also said the 180 day trial went so well they were able to continue the 360 day trial to be approved later in 2021.The problems: the challenges we face are getting doctors trained to do the insertion and getting diabetics in the office. The sensor requires calibration, and it requires a charging.The benefits: the Eversense is the only long term CGM what doesn’t require changing every 10-15 days. If you are a Dexcom user you also know the sensor fails quite often not getting to the full days. This will not happen with Sens. The product also comes with an adhesive patch that can be removed any time the person wants to. Dexcom cannot be removed unless you want to waste a costly sensor.If Senseonics ever gets to the point where they have a 360 day product, with reduced or no calibrations and no exterior patch, with pump loop capabilities, it will dethrone the competition.I always like to say, diabetes is the best investment because any advances help the quality of my wife’s life, and if there is a cure and my investment goes to zero. Well it will be the best day of our lives.I have so much more to say but thought I would share.",0.9982

Arab News reports that Turkey’s Competition Board has given Google six months to change its ad strategy after determining that the company abused its internet dominance. Its text ads supposedly skewed results by pushing some companies out of the results unless they made ad money for Google.The online giant is also facing a fine equivalent to $25.6 million as part of the ruling. It has 60 days to appeal the decision, although it wasn’t initially clear if that would happen. We’ve asked Google for comment.This comes two years after Turkey fined Google roughly $12.7 million for supposedly favoring some advertisers over others.The financial penalty is trivial for Google when it makes billions in profit every quarter. However, the six-month deadline is another matter. If the ruling holds, Google faces the prospect of either changing its ad strategy or risking a ban in a country well known for its tight grip on internet services, including Google’s.

She even declared under penalty of perjury in 2015 that she had “directed that all my emails on clintonemail.com in my custody that were or are potentially federal records be provided to the Department of State, and on information and belief, this has been done.” It wasn’t, of course. Two years later, in 2017, the FBI uncovered 72,000 pages of documents Clinton attempted to delete or did not otherwise disclose. Until the court intervened, the State Department had been slow-walking the release of those documents at a rate that would have required that we and the American people wait until at least 2020 to see it all. We have now received 756 pages of newly uncovered emails that were among the materials Clinton tried to delete or destroy, several of which were classified and were transmitted over her unsecure, non-“state.gov” email system. The production of documents in this case is now concluded with the FBI being only able to recover or find approximately 5,000 of the 33,000 government emails Hillary Clinton took and tried to destroy.",-0.6031

719,"A new Android spyware masquerades as a 'system update'Security researchers say a powerful new Android malware masquerading as a critical system update can take complete control of a victim's device and steal their data.The malware was found bundled in an app called ""System Update"" that had to be installed outside of Google Play, the app store for Android devices. Once installed by the user, the app hides and stealthily exfiltrates data from the victim's device to the operator's servers.Researchers at mobile security firm Zimperium, which discovered the malicious app, said once the victim installs the malicious app, the malware communicates with the operator's Firebase server, used to remotely control the device.The spyware can steal messages, contacts, device details, browser bookmarks and search history, record calls and ambient sound from the microphone, and take photos using the phone's cameras. The malware also tracks the victim's location, searches for document files and grabs copied data from the device's clipboard.The malware hides from the victim and tries to evade capture by reducing how much network data it consumes by uploading thumbnails to the attacker's servers rather than the full image. The malware also captures the most up-to-date data, including location and photos.Zimperium CEO Shridhar Mittal said the malware was likely part of a targeted attack.""It's easily the most sophisticated we've seen,"" said Mittal. ""I think a lot of time and effort was spent on creating this app. We believe that there are other apps out there like this, and we are trying our very best to find them as soon as possible.""",0.977

Apparently, Google then went on to create Chromecast audio, and later it’s extremely popular Google Home as a result – both of which went to market and may have severely undercut the audio experts.Now, a court ruling has handed Google a preliminary injunction which states that it can no longer sell its speakers or Chromecast devices in Germany, and may also no longer be able to provide Youtube Music to users living there either. Sonos states that Google violated one of its patents by “blatantly infringing” on its intellectual property. According to the original lawsuit from January of last year, which covered five patents on the Sonos wireless speaker design, Google sold its own products at a cheaper price and used them to gain more user data.“We’re grateful the court has acknowledged Google’s blatant infringement of Sonos’ IP,” said Sonos Chief Legal Officer Eddie Lazarus in an emailed statement. “This decision marks a promising milestone in our ongoing effort to defend our innovations and stand up to the unfair practices of Big Tech.”",0.9847

It is a perfect time for Google to take over SiriusXM and leverage their relationships with the auto OEMs and take automobile technology and entertainment to the next level. Live media through an entertainment platform will always be the primary source of entertainment in a car and NOBODY has properly capitalized on this opportunity yet. SiriusXM cannot do it on their own and Google can do it almost overnight. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon will realize their miss right after it happens! Google, Apple, or Amazon needs to acquire SiriusXM to become the dominant leader in automobile media entertainment & technology. Whichever big tech company realizes this first, will become the defacto source for on-demand and live audio streaming on mobile and in the home. Everyone thinks that mobile device options will integrate into the car and will take over the automobile. It's the other way around, the standard platform tied to the auto will become the defacto source for mobile (and the home).

They also don't have an underlying OS that can take over the technology of the automobile like Google or Apple.

878,"Google staff demand exec step aside after ethicist's firing - document(Reuters) - Staff on Google’s Ethical AI research team on Wednesday demanded the company sideline a vice president and commit to greater academic freedom, escalating a confrontation with management following this month’s termination of scientist Timnit Gebru.The personnel called on Vice President Megan Kacholia to be removed from the team’s management chain after she allegedly excluded Gebru’s boss from the decision to fire her, according to an internal document seen by Reuters.Gebru had questioned Google’s demand for her to retract a paper describing harms from Google-like technology, and the company answered by saying it accepted her resignation.The document also demanded an explanation of the dismissal, transparency into reviews of staff papers, and an investigation into how Google handles employee complaints about working conditions, like those Gebru raised while at the company.Separately, U.S. Representative Yvette Clarke, Senator Elizabeth Warren and seven other members of Congress wrote a public letter on Wednesday to Google-parent Alphabet Inc Chief Executive Sundar Pichai asking about plans to review Gebru’s firing and policies for publishing research.The demands represent the latest in a series of standoffs between Google and its critics since 20,000 of its workers walked off the job globally to protest how the search giant dealt with sexual harassment claims. The company changed policies thereafter.Gebru gained prominence as co-founder of the nonprofit Black in AI and as co-author of a landmark paper on bias in facial analysis technology. She was co-lead of the internet company’s Ethical AI team, which the employee document said was essential for informing the public on the impacts of AI systems even when that meant constructive criticism of Google.Google and Kacholia did not immediately return a request for comment. It was unclear how many people authored the demands, which followed a prior petition for academic freedom that garnered signatures from more than 2,600 people at the company.",0.9534

1029,"Google Must Face Suit Over Snooping on ‘Incognito’ Browsing(Bloomberg) -- Google failed to kill a lawsuit alleging that it secretly scoops up troves of internet data even if users browse in “Incognito” mode to keep their search activity private.The consumers who filed the case as a class action alleged that even when even they turn off data collection in Chrome, other Google tools used by websites end up amassing their personal information. A federal judge on Friday denied the Alphabet Inc. unit’s initial request to throw out the case.“The court concludes that Google did not notify users that Google engages in the alleged data collection while the user is in private browsing mode,” U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, wrote in her ruling.The ruling comes as Google and facebook face intense scrutiny by lawmakers over their data gathering practices.Three Google users filed a complaint in June claiming the company carries on a “pervasive data tracking business.” Google collects browsing history and other web activity data even after users employ safeguards to protect their data such as using “Incognito” private browsing mode, according to the complaint.“Google knows who your friends are, what your hobbies are, what you like to eat, what movies you watch, where and when you like to shop, what your favorite vacation destinations are, what your favorite color is, and even the most intimate and potentially embarrassing things you browse on the internet -- regardless of whether you follow Google’s advice to keep your activities ‘private,’” according to the complaint.",0.9481

1203,"California just passed a major privacy law that will make it harder for Facebook and Google to track people and gather dataAaron HolmesWed, November 4, 2020, 10:34 AM PST • California voters just passed Proposition 24, a ballot measure that expands the state's existing privacy laws and scales back the amount of data that big tech companies are allowed to collect on people. • The law will make it harder for Facebook and Google to track people's activity through third parties, which could make much of the tech giants' advertising business models obsolete, experts told Business Insider. • While Prop 24 is active only in California, it will effectively apply to all of the US because of the state's huge influence on the tech industry.A new law passed by California voters in the November election will set an unprecedented standard for digital privacy in the US, making it harder for big tech companies like Facebook and Google to track people's data.The Consumer Privacy Rights Act, also known as Proposition 24, was on track to pass in California as of Wednesday morning, with 56% of voters supporting the measure and over three-quarters of ballots counted.The law will strengthen existing privacy measures in California, allowing consumers to stop businesses from selling or sharing their personal information, including race, religion, genetic details, geographic location, and sexual orientation.It will also set tighter restrictions on how websites track your data to sell that information to advertising partners. Google and Facebook — two of the largest players in online advertising — both gather personal data collected by third-party websites to strengthen their advertising products, which make up the bulk of their revenue.Prop 24 could effectively block companies like Facebook and Google from continuing to collect that data, which could change their business models and cut into their existing revenue streams, privacy-compliance experts told Business Insider.""The third-party adtech industry will need to evolve ... otherwise, their business models risk becoming obsolete,"" said Heather Federman, the vice president of privacy and policy at BigID, a data-privacy compliance firm.A Facebook spokesperson did not provide comment when reached by Business Insider. A Google spokesperson did not immediately respond to Business Insider's requests for comment. Neither company has publicly taken a stance on Prop 24.The law comes as online-ad giants' business models are facing other new threats. Apple is planning an iPhone software update that will let users opt out of ad trackers, which Facebook has vehemently protested. Web browsers including Chrome, Safari, and Firefox are rolling out similar tools to let users opt out of tracking, which could cut into advertisers' revenue.Prop 24 will become enforceable in 2023. Before that happens, California regulators are expected to provide more details about how it will be enforced, which could shape its influence on major tech companies.Despite its potential to hurt the ad revenue of major tech companies, Prop 24 gained support from several tech business leaders who advocate privacy, including former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who said the law was necessary to give people more control over their data.Raju Vegesna, the chief evangelist at the global software firm Zoho, said he expected both private companies and governments to continue to crack down on third-party ad trackers because of growing privacy concerns from consumers. Vegesna added that Zoho removed third party trackers from its sites in July.""That means we leave money on the table, but just because it's there doesn't mean you have to take it,"" Vegesna said in an email to Business Insider. ""The privacy tipping point for most countries will come when they realize just how much data big tech companies such as Google have collected on their citizens and that as a government, there is nothing they can do about it."" Some privacy advocates have said the law doesn't go far enough, calling instead for Congress to pass privacy legislation that sets a single standard nationwide.",0.9747

(Reuters) - At least nine popular YouTube channels were promoting on Thursday debunked accusations about voting fraud in the U.S. presidential race, conspiratorial content that could jeopardize advertising and memberships revenue they get from the video service.Reuters found the channels, ranging from ones with 1,000 followers to more than 629,000, endorsing claims that fact-checking units of the Associated Press, Reuters and other organizations have deemed false or inaccurate.YouTube, owned by Alphabet Inc's Google , has rules that forbid channels using its revenue-generation tools from making ""claims that are demonstrably false and could significantly undermine participation or trust in an electoral or democratic process.""Google said it was reviewing videos from the nine channels as well as others and may suspend ads and membership sales, a penalty commonly known as ""demonetization,"" if violations are found.Claiming voter fraud is widespread or that mail-in ballots cannot be trusted would be in violation, but highlighting people who say they experienced voter fraud or making hyperbolic statements about a political party ""stealing"" the election would not, Google said.With ballot tallying ongoing in a few states whose results will decide the hotly contested race between Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden, Trump has made unsubstantiated accusations about the Democratic party stealing the election. Trump's supporters have rallied behind the misinformation on social media and in protests outside vote-counting sites.Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc and others have struggled to guard against the misinformation as millions of posts arrive each day.Researchers who track misinformation say it is fueled by content creators who see an opportunity to profit from it. Over the last few years, they have pressured YouTube and its advertisers to tighten scrutiny.Some YouTube advertisers now avoid sponsoring political content. But the membership feature, under which fans pay a few dollars monthly for exclusive content and promotional merchandise, has helped offset lost ad sales.One of the channels seen by Reuters, John Talks, shared two videos on Thursday about alleged voter fraud in Michigan - a key battleground state in the election that Biden has won - generating more than 90,000 views in eight hours.Among the claims cited was that wagons, suitcases and coolers were used to smuggle ballots into a counting center. At least three news outlets investigated the claim and determined the items carried food for election workers and camera equipment for a local TV station.John Talks did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.The liberal online watchdog group Media Matters for America said in a report on Thursday that it found videos making dubious claims post-election have garnered more than 1 million views collectively.YouTube's policy on ""demonstrably false"" election information drew attention on Wednesday when CNBC reported that One American News Network was generating ad revenue from its YouTube video prematurely declaring Trump the winner. YouTube said it would not remove the video, but stopped running ads on it.Trump's talk of fraud has created opportunity for his critics, too. Some popular YouTube channels, which run ads and sell memberships, have generated hundreds of thousands of views on videos rebutting Trump supporters' claims of voter fraud.",-0.8783

We should all heed his warnings about AI-""The least scary future I can think of is one where we have at least democratized AI because if one company or small group of people manages to develop godlike digital superintelligence, they could take over the world,"" Musk said.""At least when there's an evil dictator, that human is going to die. But for an AI, there would be no death. It would live forever. And then you'd have an immortal dictator from which we can never escape.""AI IS HIGHLY LIKELY TO DESTROY HUMANS, ELON MUSK WARNS'Should that be controlled by a few people at Google with no oversight?'In Mr Musk’s opinion, there’s a very small chance that humans will be safe from such systems. “Maybe there's a five to 10 percent chance of success [of making AI safe],” he told Neuralink staff after showing them a documentary on AI, reports Rolling Stone.He also told them that he invested in DeepMind in order to keep an eye on Google’s development of AI.Mr Musk has called for the companies working on AI to slow down to ensure they don’t unintentionally build something unsafe.“I keep sounding the alarm bell but until people see robots going down the street killing people, they don’t know how to react because it seems so ethereal.""“Between Facebook, Google and Amazon – and arguably Apple, but they seem to care about privacy – they have more information about you than you can remember,” he told Rolling Stone. “There's a lot of risk in concentration of power.

The measure is expected to generate as much as $250 million in its first year.The Maryland tax specifically applies to digital ads that are displayed within the state. It's also levied based on the ad sales that a company generates. Companies that make at least $100 million to $1 billion a year will be taxed at a 2.5% rate. Companies that make more than $15 billion — which includes Facebook and google — will face a 10% tax on digital ad revenue.Legislators in Connecticut and Indiana have already introduced similar measures to tax social media giants.The tax legislation is just part of a growing debate about the dominance and power of technology giants. In the U.S., companies like Facebook and Google are facing multiple antitrust lawsuits. Antitrust legislation introduced at the federal level could target those companies. The measures in the U.S. also follow in the footsteps of governments in Europe, which have introduced both new restrictions targeting Facebook and Google.",0.8837

Much the way the Treasury Secretary's were all from Goldman Sachs.I just don't know why GOOG can't produce an ecosystem the way Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alibaba and even facebook have done. Besides their miniscule line of products, they're somehow limited to selling ads for most of their revenue like facebook! If Bezoz were running Google, he'd charge every company for every click-through (organic or not). He'd then target the most popular sites and create entire clone businesses. You wouldn't even need google to find anything b/c Google would be everything! Somehow GOOG just can't pull it all together.

1385,"Google illegally tracking Android users, according to new complaintAustrian privacy activist Max Schrems has filed a complaint against Google in France alleging that the US tech giant is illegally tracking users on Android phones without their consent.Android phones generate unique advertising codes, similar to Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), that allow Google and third parties to track users’ browsing behavior in order to better target them with advertising.In a complaint filed on Wednesday, Schrems’ campaign group Noyb (None of your business) argued that in creating and storing these codes without first obtaining explicit permission from users, Google was engaging in “illegal operations” that violate EU privacy laws.Noyb urged France’s data privacy regulator to launch a probe into Google’s tracking practices and to force the company to comply with privacy rules. It argued that fines should be imposed on the tech giant if the watchdog finds evidence of wrongdoing.“Through these hidden identifiers on your phone, Google and third parties can track users without their consent,” said Stefano Rossetti, privacy lawyer at Noyb. “It is like having powder on your hands and feet, leaving a trace of everything you do on your phone—from whether you swiped right or left to the song you downloaded.”Google, which has roughly 300 million Android users in Europe, is facing a separate complaint from Noyb to the Austrian data protection authority, which argues specifically that users cannot delete the identifier from their Android devices.According to people familiar with the latest complaint, Noyb chose to approach the French data watchdog because its legal system is well suited to handling complaints under the European ePrivacy directive.Noyb also had concerns over the effectiveness of the Irish data protection authority—the de facto leader in European data privacy regulation—after a number of member states including Germany accused it of sluggish enforcement.Last year, Schrems won a landmark case at Europe’s highest court that ruled a transatlantic agreement on transferring data between the bloc and the US used by thousands of corporations did not protect EU citizens’ privacy.",-0.6955

According to the blog, FLoC is targeted at forming a group based on people’s interests and demographics that are easily fetched from browsing history. This allows the company to profile and target unwanted, creepy advertising along with content without third-party cookies.To help Chrome users get out of this tracking scheme, DuckDuckGo suggested people to not use Google Chrome. It said as of now, only Google Chrome has enabled FLoC and thus, it is not present in any other browser vendor. Other vendors have not even expressed an intention or interest for implementing such trackers. Since many browsers are free to download, the blog urged people to get some Google alternatives.

1546,"Google sued by Texas and 9 other states accusing it of 'antitrust evils'Google (GOOG, GOOGL) was hit with a lawsuit from Texas and 9 other states Wednesday accusing it of anticompetitive behaviors related to its ad tech business, which has faced scrutiny due to its unrivaled size and volume.The suit claims that internal documents show that Google tried to crush competition with exclusionary tactics, including by striking a deal with Facebook (FB) — its biggest competitor — to manipulate advertising auctions.“The Supreme Court has warned that there are such things as antitrust evils. This litigation will establish that Google is guilty of such antitrust evils, and it seeks to ensure that Google won’t be evil anymore,” the 130-page lawsuit stated.The suit comes less than two months after the Department of Justice and 11 U.S. states, including Texas, filed an antitrust lawsuit accusing Google of engaging in anticompetitive behavior in its search and search advertising businesses. Texas is leading the latest suit focusing on the ad tech business, joined by Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Utah.As with the Texas-led suit, the DOJ’s lawsuit included mention of an agreement between Google an another Big Tech firm. In that instance it was Apple (AAPL), which the DOJ alleges joined with Google to make the company’s search engine the default for its various products including Siri, its Safari browser, and its Spotlight search.“Google repeatedly used its monopolistic power to control pricing, engage in market collusion to rig auctions, in a tremendous violation of justice,” Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a video posted on Twitter. “...If the free market were a baseball game, Google positioned itself as the batter, the pitcher, and the umpire.”On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Texas had hired prominent lawyers to work on its case against Google, including the Lanier Law Firm, home to Kenneth Star, who famously led the Whitewater investigation into Bill Clinton.Google’s digital advertising business has faced scrutiny due to its unrivaled size and volume. The company controls some of the most important pieces of the online advertising marketplace, its Google Marketing Platform, formerly DoubleClick, is a premier tool for online publishers, helping them create, manage, and track online marketing campaigns.‘Hallmarks of a highly competitive industry’Critics of Google’s dominance of the online ad industry point to the fact that their web traffic would take a severe hit if they left the company’s platform as proof that it is too powerful.In the suit filed Wednesday, the states alleged Google lie to publishers using its ad server to favor Google’s ad exchange and that the company entered into an illegal agreement with Facebook that benefited both companies by flattening competition in so-called “header bidding,” a method of ad bidding that was developed to circumvent Google’s grip on advertisement exchange markets.What’s more, the suit claims that Google violated users’ privacy by signing a 2015 agreement with Facebook that gave Google access to millions of Americans’ end-to-end encrypted WhatsApp messages, photos, videos, and audio files.The October suit filed by the Justice Department and 11 states targets deals that Google has with device makers like Apple (AAPL), browser developers, and wireless carriers like Yahoo Finance parent Verizon (VZ) to make Google the default search engine. Those agreements effectively shut out competition for search, the suit alleges.On Thursday, Google is expected to face a third antitrust lawsuit, this one spearheaded by a bipartisan coalition of states led by the attorneys general of Colorado and Nebraska, Politico reported Tuesday. That lawsuit will reportedly allege that Google designs its search engine to disadvantage rivals.",0.994

If the company that capitalizes on this opportunity also has a streaming video product, the potential service consolidations and packages will open up so many opportunities to accumulate subscribers and cross sell other services all related to how people are entertained (video and audio).Please see below and consider the power of the label ""Apple Radio"" or ""Google Radio"" replacing SiriusXM radio in every car. It is a perfect time for Apple or Google to take over SiriusXM and leverage SiriusXM's existing relationships with the auto OEMs and take automobile technology and entertainment to the next level. Live media through an entertainment platform will always be the primary source of entertainment in a car and NOBODY has properly capitalized on this opportunity yet. SiriusXM cannot do it on their own and Apple or Google can do it almost overnight. Microsoft and Amazon will realize their miss right after it happens! Just like mobile phones, every dashboard should have a standardized open api Apple or Google OS behind it, and taking over SiriusXM is the open door to that start down the path of vehicle entertainment, connected vehicle, vehicle technology, and vehicle OS standardization. Google or Apple will own the car like Microsoft once owned the PC.Google, Apple, or maybe Amazon can shortcut becoming the dominant leader in automobile media entertainment & technology by just acquiring SiriusXM. Whichever big tech company realizes this first, will become the defacto source for on-demand and live audio streaming not only in the car, but on mobile and in the home. Everyone thinks that mobile device options will integrate into the car and will take over the automobile. It's the other way around, the standard platform tied to the auto will become the consumer defacto source for mobile (and the home). SiriusXM has a great position but they don't have the resources and reputation like Google, Apple, or maybe Amazon to make it happen. They also don't have an underlying OS that can take over the technology of the automobile like Google or Apple. When held hostage behind the wheel of your car everyday, ""Siri"", ""Alexa"", or ""Google Assistant"" should be the permanent passenger with you as there is no place you need them more than your car! ""Siri turn on my bright lights"", ""Siri turn on Pearl Jam Radio"", ""Siri read my text from Helene"", ""Siri navigate to my house"", ""Siri find a Jimmy Johns along my route home"", etc... When will one of these companies realize the value of SiriusXM's current position being so far down the path with no competition, great content, and all the auto OEM relationships / understanding? Taking what SiriusXM has and changing the name to Apple Radio or Google Radio would catapult the respective company right into the driver's seat! (no pun intended)",0.9996

Let's dive into the financial ratios....gross margin 54 percent, EBITDA margin 30 percent, operating margin 22.5 percent, net margin a whopping 22.1 percent, leverage nonexistent. Let's move into growth rates....current quarter revenue growth rate 24.7 percent, earnings growth rate over the next 5 years 16.95 percent, market implied 5 year compound annual growth rate 21 percent as of yesterday. inventory turnover more than 3 times the industry median, the list goes on and on. Netlist longs will get pocket change assuming this lawsuit actually is victorious which is very questionable, people like me that have been long since 2013 will barely feel a pinch from the decline, as will GOOGL.

The jury was about meet to declare damages on Google. Google then challenged the validity of NLST 912 patent Netlist and google agreed to a stay of the damages until the patent was fully vetted by the USPTO. That has been completed and USPTO found in favor of NLST. So stay can be lifted and the judge can assemble a jury to determine a just award to NLST. Or Google can come up with a figure on their own settle and avoid court.Also be aware this has been a 10 year plus legal battle in addition Google engineers lied to the judge saying they had removed all offending modules.

The Google parent company reported $3.2 billion in net income for the quarter, which works out to $4.54 a share, down from $5.01 a share a year ago, when the company also dealt with a big antitrust fine out of the EU Without the fine, Alphabet would have reported earnings of $11.75 a share, the company said, well higher than analysts' average estimate of $9.64 a share, according to FactSet. Alphabet reported revenue after accounting for traffic-acquisition costs of $26.24 billion, up from $20.91 billion in the second quarter of 2017 and higher than the average analyst estimate of $25.58 billion. Alphabet shares jumped nearly 5% in after-hours trading Monday to prices higher than its intraday record of $1,221.59, following a 1.1% gain in regular trading to $1,211. The company's class A shares have gained 15% so far this year, as the S&P 500 index has increased 4.8%.",0.9902

They accuse Google of abusing its power in online advertising to crush competition.They said the company’s anti-competitive conduct even included a deal with rival Facebook to “manipulate” ad sales.The alleged deal, which was seemingly codenamed “Jedi Blue”, states that the companies will “cooperate and assist each other in responding to any Antitrust Action” and “promptly and fully inform the Other Party of any Governmental Communication Related to the Agreement,"" according to an unredacted draft of the lawsuit seen by the Wall Street Journal.In the lead up to the deal, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was reportedly told that the company had to “invest hundreds more engineers” and spend billions to compete with Google, or make a deal with the search giant – details which do not appear in the final lawsuit.Facebook’s Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg reportedly signed the deal with Google, according to the draft, telling Mr Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives that it was “a big deal strategically.”The draft states that in the fourth year of the deal, Facebook had to spend at least $500 million on Google’s ad auctions.“Facebook is to win a fixed per cent of those auctions,” the draft version says. The final lawsuit only reveals the first three words; the rest of the sentence is redacted.This deal is said to be “relatively cheap” according to internal Facebook documents described in the draft lawsuit, compared to competing directly in the ad auction.If Google could not “avoid competing with” Facebook, it would “build a moat” in order to protect the companies, according to a Google presentation mentioned in the draft lawsuit. The direct quotes are not included in the finalised lawsuit.Another internal Google presentation from October 2016 states that the company was concerned about competition from Facebook and that it needed to “to stop these guys from doing HB [header bidding]” – a process by which Facebook could programmatically purchase advertising.“We probably need to consider something more aggressive,” the draft states. A subsequent communication from Google in 2017 reportedly said the company’s aim was to “collaborate when necessary to maintain status quo.”",0.9933

The Division remains committed to conducting this review as thoroughly, efficiently, and expeditiously as possible”.Such confusion comes as Fitbit users who had deleted their account ahead of the prospective merger nevertheless received emails from Fitbit to private addresses.“In 2019 I made a HUGE deal about having you permanently delete my data before Google bought you, and your helpdesk said you erased me. Yet I just received an email from you at my private email address. How did this happen?”, wrote software engineer and author Tanya Janca.“I do not want google having my personal data that I kept in your systems. You promised me (check your DMs to me) that I was erased, BEFORE the merger”, she continued.Chris Garaffa, author of the technology newsletter “Tech for the People”, said they had experienced the same occurrence.Neither Google nor Fitbit responded to a request for comment from The Independent before publication.Google paid $2.1 billion for the acquisition of fitness-gadget maker Fitbit, although news of the merger raised alarms from privacy critics.Google makes most of its money by selling ads based on information it collects about its billions of users' interests and whereabouts.

Google, alongside Facebook, dominates the digital ad market and in the fourth quarter of 2020 pulled in $32 billion in revenue primarily from search.Fishkin previously published research in 2019 that suggested just over 50% of Google queries ended without a click. He warned that it was tough to compare the 2019 and 2020 research because he used different data sources as the basis for analysis but, he wrote, the trend was one of ""increasing click cannibalization by Google.""Of major concern to Google critics will be the idea that the search giant is finding ways to keep people on its own properties, potentially at the expense of third-party sites and publishers.For example, a Google search for ""COVID-19 deaths"" offers the below, with information pulled from the likes of the New York Times, Wikipedia, and the World Health Organization placed at the top of the page, ahead of clickable links to their sources.Google is under pressure over the way it presents results in the US and EU, specifically its ""OneBoxes"", the prominent squares of text or images that pop up when you search, for example, holiday destinations or the weather in a particular city.A host of job and travel companies have accused the tech titan of using its dominance in search to expand into specialist search services, like Google Flights or Google Travel, at the expense of competitors.In a letter signed by the likes of TripAdvisor, Expedia, and Trivago, more than 130 accommodation, travel, and job vacancy firms from around the world said claim Google has ""[leveraged] its unassailable dominance in general Internet search ... to gain a competitive head start.""",0.9937

1850,"Google. I love the company. So Great. But I’ve had no desire to be invested in it since not long after Facebook’s IPO. Google, for awhile, WAS “the internet”. Facebook has been taking that mantel from Google gradually over the last few years. I just found out that in the philippines, Facebook actually is the internet.Google’s shares fell and dragged Facebook’s down with them. But their spending increase was largely due to investments in “future growth” that Facebook does not have to make and probably is not making. For some reason, the market thought that Google’s spending relates for Facebook’s. Facebook is hiring 20k new Indian workers at perhaps $5k/year each. That’s $100m. A rounding error on their *increase* in earnings this quarter. There is no comparison.Sad as it is to admit, $GOOGL is the new Microsoft - a one trick pony resting on its laurels that might finally grow after its myopic founders get out of its way.FB on the other hand is not even close to peak earnings, and it has at least 2 years before a Democrat president could spearhead any significant antitrust or other regulation.In a year, FB should be $250+. Heck, it should be there tomorrow. Let’s see.",0.9788
1851,"Airbnb Says Google's Competing Travel Sites Push Its Listings Down in Search Results • Airbnb, in its S-1 filing, wrote that it believes its search results have been adversely affected by the launch of Google Travel and Google Vacation Rental Ads. • The company's public comments follow several other travel executives' who allege Google favors its own products in its Search results. • Google faces a lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice, which alleges it uses its search monopoly unfairly to suppress competition.Airbnb says Google's search business has prevented the home-sharing company from reaping internet traffic, according to documents the company filed as it prepares to sell shares to the public. Airbnb allows users to book short-term rentals and experiences while traveling. Under the ""Risk Factors"" in Airbnb's S-1 filing, the company said Google has favored its own products over the company's, resulting in fewer online visitors to its website. In the last year, the Alphabet company has added more search features akin to travel websites, including for vacation rentals.""We believe that our SEO results have been adversely affected by the launch of Google Travel and Google Vacation Rental Ads, which reduce the prominence of our platform in organic search results for travel-related terms and placement on Google,"" the prospectus states.Airbnb explains SEO, or search engine optimization, as the practice of tailoring content to appear more prominently in search results without paying for placement.We focus on unpaid channels such as SEO,"" the prospectus states. ""SEO involves developing our platform in a way that enables a search engine to rank our platform prominently for search queries for which our platform's content may be relevant. Changes to search engine algorithms or similar actions are not within our control, and could adversely affect our search-engine rankings and traffic to our platform.""The company warns that continued problems with search rankings could force it to spend more on marketing.""To the extent that our brand and platform are listed less prominently or fail to appear in search results for any reason, we would need to increase our paid marketing spend which would increase our overall customer acquisition costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.""The Justice Department filed its long-expected antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet last month, alleging the company has unlawfully maintained a monopoly in search by cutting off rivals from key distribution channels. Alphabet rebutted the argument, saying it has plenty of competitors and that its services help consumers.Airbnb and Alphabet have one mutual board member, Ann Mather.Airbnb's statements follow other travel executives who have criticized Google's effect on the travel industry. TripAdvisor CEO Stephen Kaufer, a longtime critic of Google, told CNBC last month that he welcomes the DOJ's antitrust lawsuit against the Alphabet search unit, saying the company uses ""its dominance in internet gatekeeping at the expense of other businesses.""Expedia CEO Peter Kern also recently said, ""We have no axe to grind against Google, except that we don't think the marketplace is equitable.""",0.9835

""I have been able to send them the best possible signals that should give them a great encouragement to engage with the process and conclude the arrangements we'd like to see them conclude with the various news media organisations in Australia.""And that is the best way to enable that matter to be settled.""Google, alongside Facebook, has been engaged in a stoush with the ACCC since August over the code making its way to law in Australia. Morrison said he and Sundar Pichai discussed some of the specifics of the elements contained within the code.“They raised those matters, I think, very respectfully,"" he said. ""But I think we have been able to get that into a much more positive space about the ability to continue to provide services here in Australia.""But at the end of the day, they understand that Australia sets the rules for how these things operate. And I was very clear about how I saw this playing out.""Morrison and his army of ministers have this week touted Microsoft's Bing as the answer to the Google-sized hole that would be left if it did, in fact, pull the plug.Appearing at the National Press Club on Monday, Morrison said he was confident Australians would be left with sufficient alternatives if Google moved ahead with its threat, pointing to a meeting he had with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.Shortly after, Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts Paul Fletcher also rallied behind Bing, saying that in the event Google left, he expected to see investment from other players in the local market.Microsoft president Brad Smith on Wednesday threw his support behind the code, saying also his company is committed to Australia and its news publishers. And on Thursday morning, Nadella said it was important that technology companies engage and support the press, as they are an important part of democracy.

In my view, the tax cut is not yet priced in. 1245 was an easy target before the earnings ""miss"". Now maybe we are shooting for 1200. Either way, it doesn't matter. That gap will fill.

1990,"Sen. Amy Klobuchar Introduces Competition & Antitrust Bill; Turns Up Heat On Facebook, GoogleU.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) has formally introduced legislation to strengthen antitrust laws and restore competition to American markets. The Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act “will give federal enforcers the resources they need to do their jobs, strengthen prohibitions on anticompetitive conduct and mergers, and make additional reforms to improve enforcement,” her office said Thursday.Former Democratic presidential contender Klobuchar is the lead Dem on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights. The move, which had been anticipated, turns up the heat on big social media and tech companies like Facebook and Google. Late last year, the FTC and 48 attorneys general filed antitrust suits against Facebook, alleging the company quashes competition, including by buying up smaller rivals like Instagram and WhatsApp. Google is the target of three suits by a combination of state attorneys general and the DOJ for its dominance in search.“Competition and effective antitrust enforcement are critical to protecting workers and consumers, spurring innovation, and promoting economic equity. While the United States once had some of the most effective antitrust laws in the world, our economy today faces a massive competition problem. We can no longer sweep this issue under the rug and hope our existing laws are adequate,” said Senator Klobuchar. She called the legislation the first step to overhauling and modernizing our laws so we can effectively promote competition and protect American consumers.”The bill is cosponsored by Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust and Commerce Committee members Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Ed Markey (D-MA), and Brian Schatz (D-HI). It calls for increased enforcement resources, strengthening prohibitions against anticompetitive mergers and putting the burden of proof on companies, updating legal standards for mergers and cracking down on “harmful dominant-firm conduct.”Since 2008, the bill says, U.S. firms “have engaged in over $10,000,000,000,000 in mergers and acquisitions. The acquisition of nascent or potential rivals by dominant firms can present significant long term threats to competition and innovation; the acquisition, by one of its competitors, of a maverick firm that plays a disruptive role in the market–by using an innovative business model or technology, offering lower prices or new, different products or services products, or by other means that benefit consumers—can present a threat to competition.”",0.9914

But the issue was not included in the federal complaint against Google.Google objected to the document demand, and others, as ""overly broad"" and potentially privileged but said it was willing to discuss the matter.The documents are requested as part of a pre-trial process for a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit, filed in October, focused on Google's search and search advertising, and a broader state case, which was filed in December. Google has denied wrongdoing in each.Other documents requested by the government included internal Google communications regarding the government investigation and lawsuit; documents dating back to 2000 regarding Google's search engine and how it compares to competitors and documents going back to 2005 regarding the Chrome browser. Google objected to at least portions of each of those document requests.Other of the more than 60 document demands, which Google objected to at least partially, included documents discussing Google's funding of think tanks, or specific academic projects, documents related to the removal of an app from the Play Store and its later restoration.",0.9858

Perhaps the Trump administration will decide to prosecute Google for partnering with a foreign firm for the purpose of fending off competition from a domestic one, which may endanger national security somehow.

2061,"Drugs for Sale Plague Social Media PlatformsWASHINGTON, March 15, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Social media platforms continue to have difficulty removing illegal offers of opioids, steroids and COVID-19 ""vaccines."" Even after they have been alerted of specific posts and long past when they have made public pledges to do a better job of making their services safe for U.S. consumers, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Telegram are not backing their words with action, new research from the Digital Citizens Alliance (Digital Citizens) and the Coalition for a Safer Web (CSW) shows.The Digital Weeds 2021 report revisited past research conducted by Digital Citizens and CSW to determine if social media platforms have truly addressed illicit activity that was brought to their attention. Researchers searched for old posts and previous users who were attempting to conduct illegal activity. In some cases, the research teams found accounts and similar posts from the same users, whose posts were taken down years earlier, still up on the platforms. In some cases, the research teams found current accounts and similar posts from the same users who were identified years earlier.In addition, researchers also found that the fraudulent sale of COVID-19 vaccines, which was identified by DCA and CSW in February, remains despite calls for action by Facebook's Advisory Board to address COVID-19 vaccine misinformation and related dangers.""I find it amazing that the platforms have the ability to pinpoint a 47-year-old resident of Walla Walla, Washington who might be interested in buying retro-styled, minor league baseball caps from teams of the 1950s, but can't figure out a way to stop the posts pushing illegal and/or illicit activities on their pages,"" said Digital Citizens Alliance Executive Director Tom Galvin. ""The platforms have had a chance to correct this problem. How much more evidence do we need to present before lawmakers say, 'enough is enough' and take the action the platforms themselves have not been able to take?""Both Google and Facebook, once enormously popular, respected companies, are increasingly questioned by consumers as well as federal and state regulators for their business practices. But a lot remains the same: • Criminal activity and/or illicit activity highlighted in previous research, such as the selling of opioids, steroids, and malware, can still be found easily today. • Many videos and posts shared in prior DCA and CSW reports and/or with media contacts are still available across numerous social media platforms. • The platforms still have advertising from premium, respected brands running next to videos and/or posts for illegal and/or illicit item. • The platforms allow for communication between drug pushers and potential buyers. Whether by containing phone numbers and emails in videos and/or posts or allowing for conversations to happen in chats. • The platforms' algorithms amplify connectivity between potential buyers and sellers of illegal and/or illicit items. Researchers, acting as potential buyers looking for drugs, showed that when they look for drugs on Instagram, Instagram will in turn begin directing drug sellers back to the potential buyer. • When outed by media outlets, platforms will often take down specific videos mentioned by reporters, but not address the larger problem. This leaves consumers vulnerable to similar, or sometimes even the same scams, that inspired the news coverage in the first place.Ambassador Marc Ginsberg, President of the Coalition for a Safer Web, added: ""Our report is another abject proofpoint that so long as social media companies are unregulated and left to run wild, consumers will be exposed to the criminal web marketplace opened by extremists and terrorists hawking illicit, dangerous drugs to fund their organizations and operations. Until Congress acts, both the FDA (by issuing formal warning letters prohibiting the sale of illegal drugs) and the FTC (by prohibiting criminal operations on social media companies) must step in immediately to protect the American people?""",0.9903

(NLST) announced today an update on an inter partes reexamination of Netlist's US 7,619,912 (""912"") patent. On January 31, 2019 the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), in response to Google's rehearing request, denied rehearing of the PTAB's previous decision upholding the validity of claims in Netlist's '912 patent. The PTAB's extensive rehearing decision rejected Google's three main points involving memory modules and the specific use of rank-selecting signals for rank multiplication. Google began its petition for reexamination of the '912 patent starting in 2010. Netlist believes the teachings of the '912 patent can be found in standards now being established for server memory modules at DDR5.Netlist also noted that on January 22, 2019, patent litigation initiated by Smart Modular Technologies (""Smart Modular"") against Netlist regarding U.S. Patent No. 8,250,295 (""the '295 patent"") was dismissed with prejudice by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California.

Diversity in many ways is no better than the discrimination against blacks during the 1960s. Yet, the Neoliberal press, many of whom have benefited from the diversity dogma, have become the front men for the Neoliberal Nazis, who seek to gain advantages not based on their qualifications, but rather because they are the self proclaimed victims of discrimination that they feel is rampant in our society.

2092,"Web giants must stop cashing in on pension scam misery, say MPsMinisters must force tech giants such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft to stop the “immoral” practice of profiting from the £10bn of pension fraud committed by internet scammers, a committee of MPs has urged.Fraudsters use online advertisements, mostly on Google and Facebook to trick people out of their pension funds, according to a report published by the work and pensions select committee, but regulators are “powerless” to hold the internet firms to account.After accepting payment for the ads from criminals, the tech firms then make more money by hosting public warnings about the scams from regulators such as the Financial Conduct Authority, the MPs’ report said.“It should not require legislative solutions to deter global firms from benefiting from the proceeds of crime, but unfortunately legislation is clearly needed,” the report says.Although the government is proposing to introduce an online harms bill to parliament later this year, this will focus on child sexual abuse and terrorism, without any mention of the epidemic of internet fraud.During its inquiry, the committee heard evidence from the Pension Scams Industry Group that 40,000 people had been defrauded of £10bn since 2015, with online fraud in general costing £190bn a year.The MPs say internet firms should be covered by legislation that already forces newspapers and broadcasters to vet financial adverts or face legal liability. Stephen Timms, the committee chairman, told the Observer: “These companies should not be taking the crooks’ money and putting up on their platforms the material they provide, then also taking the regulators’ money to warn people about the crooks.”“There does need to be a duty of care in this area, as in child pornography and the other things that are intended to be in the scope of this bill,” Timms went on. “The government’s intention appears to be to exclude financial harms from this bill. I do think it’s really important that this opportunity should be taken.”Fraud accounts for a third of reported crime but less than 1% of police resources are spent on investigating it, Graeme Biggar, the director general of the National Economic Crime Centre, told the committee. Enforcement is splintered between the police and seven regulators.The MPs called for a dedicated Pension scams centre to manage an intelligence database and enforce the law.Younger fraud victims often suffer a double whammy of losing their pension funds, then facing large tax bills on the money they have lost, the report says. People who access their pension fund before the age of 55 have to pay charges that can amount to half the value of the fund. Scammers often persuade people there are loopholes, the MPs say, but this is false and HMRC is “unrelenting and uncompromising” when it pursues scam victims for the tax owed.As a result, some victims never report the crime for fear of tax penalties, the report says. The MPs called on HMRC to “show some discretion” and said the law should be changed so tax is taken at source.There was also evidence of “secondary scammers” – fraudsters who stole people’s pensions then targeted their victims again by posing as claims management companies. The bogus firms would cold call victims, offering to help bring a claim against their insurance adviser, ask for a fee up front, then disappear.",-0.9969

These ads lead to look-a-like websites that steal consumers' financial details. One victim said she paid £85 for a pair of boots, but instead received a pair of cheap sunglasses.The study, of 2,000 adults in the UK, found that while Google was worse at reacting to reported scams, victims were more likely to encounter a fraudulent ad on Facebook in the first place.Around 27% said they had come up against a scam ad on Facebook compared to 19% on Google.Adam French, a consumer rights expert at Which?, said the findings showed both Facebook and Google had left their users ""worryingly exposed to scams,"" and suggested the UK government bring in legislation to root out the problem.""Online platforms must be given a legal responsibility to identify, remove and prevent fake and fraudulent content on their sites,"" he said. ""The case for including scams in the Online Safety Bill is overwhelming and the government needs to act now.""As part of the British government's proposed Online Safety Bill, tech companies that allow users to post their own material or talk to others online could be fined up to £18 million (around $25 million) or 10% of their annual revenue, whichever is higher, for failing to remove ""harmful"" content.The Bill is expected to contain extra provisions for the biggest social media companies with ""high-risk features,"" expected to include Facebook, TikTok, Instagram and Twitter.",-0.9826

2369,"Google Fires Another Top Researcher on Its AI Ethics TeamGoogle has fired another top artificial intelligence researcher, Margaret Mitchell, in the latest escalation of internal tensions at the company following December’s controversial ouster of Timnit Gebru, a Black AI ethicist. As if the PR fire with Google’s AI ethics team didn’t have enough fuel already.Mitchell, who formerly led the team alongside Gebru, was caught using automated scripts to comb through her work emails to find evidence of discrimination and harassment to back up Gebru’s claims, Axios reports. In January, she lost access to her corporate email after Google launched an investigation into her activity. In a statement to Reuters, Google claims Mitchell’s firing followed disciplinary recommendations by investigators and a review committee. Google said she violated the company’s code of conduct and security policies and transferred electronic files outside the company.Mitchell announced her termination Friday evening in a tweet. When reached for comment by CNN regarding Google’s claims, she told the outlet, “I don’t know about those allegations actually. I mean most of that is news to me.”She joined the company in 2016 as a senior research scientist and founded Google’s AI ethics team with Gebru. In the past few months, Mitchell has been openly critical of Google’s abrupt dismissal of Gebru, one of the few Black employees at the company (just 3.7% of Google’s U.S. staff are Black according to its 2020 annual diversity report). Gebru claims she was fired after raising concerns about the company’s shoddy diversity protocols and its attempt to censor research critical of its products.Gebru’s firing “created a domino effect of trauma for me and the rest of the team, and I believe we are being increasingly punished for that trauma,” Mitchell wrote on Twitter Friday. Another leading AI researcher at the company, Alex Hanna, tweeted a screenshot that evening purportedly of an email she received from higher-ups threatening that she is next on the chopping block.Thousands of Google employees and experts in the AI community protested Google’s decision to fire Gebru, and it’s led to increased scrutiny over the company’s AI ethics research. Now it seems internal tensions have started bubbling over as Google attempts to muzzle dissenters and hurriedly turn the page on the controversy by burying it in a flood of policy changes. Earlier this week, Google announced plans to restructure its responsible AI teams to consolidate leadership under Marian Croak, Google’s VP of engineering. Hours before Mitchell’s firing, Google reportedly sent out an internal email detailing several other new research and diversity policy changes the company’s implementing in the wake of an internal investigation into Gebru’s termination.",-0.9492

Penalties would include fines, as well as partial or total limits on access to the platforms in Russia.Since April, Russian media companies have been complaining that Twitter, Facebook and YouTube were censoring their accounts, sponsors of the measure said in documents submitted with the draft law. State-backed news outlets including RT have criticized what they say is censorship by U.S. platforms, which say the measures are part of efforts to fight disinformation.“Discriminatory actions against Russian clients of these services have taken place,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on a conference call when asked about the initiative. “This must be countered.” But he stopped short of endorsing restrictions on access, saying appropriate sanctions would be determined in the legislative process.",-0.4459

The ruling came after last week's oral hearing before a three-judge panel at the Federal Circuit and pending an appeal granted by the Supreme Court of the U.S., the decision is final and binding on future cases.""For ten years Netlist has steadfastly opposed Google's misguided campaign to invalidate the ‘912 patent,"" said Netlist's CEO, C.K. Hong. ""We are very pleased that in the end the appellate court made it clear that the claims of this seminal patent are indeed valid and in so doing, further vindicate our decade-long defense of the company's strategic intellectual property. We will now move to lift the stay in the patent infringement lawsuit against Google in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of CA., in order to recover current and past damages related to the ‘912 patent.""In response to Netlist's 2009 complaint, Google first filed its petition for reexamination of the '912 patent in 2010 and was later joined in its effort by Inphi and Smart Modular. On January 31, 2019 PTAB denied Google's request for a rehearing of the PTAB's previous decision upholding the validity of the '912 patent claims. The PTAB's extensive rehearing decision adopted Netlist's positions on the claims and rejected Google's invalidity arguments involving the specific use of rank-selecting signals for rank multiplication.Netlist believes that the teachings of the '912 patent can be found in various DDR3 and DDR4 server DIMMs (Dual Inline Memory Module) as well as future products that will be produced under the DDR5 server DIMM standards currently being established by the industry.",0.9965

2407,"Google Staff Launch Union, Escalating Tension With Leaders(Bloomberg) -- Employees of Google and parent company Alphabet Inc. announced the creation of a union on Monday, escalating years of confrontation between workers and management of the internet giant.The Alphabet Workers Union will collect dues, pay organizing staff and have an elected board of directors. It will be open to all employees and contractors in North America, regardless of their role or classification, and plans to take on issues including compensation and ethical concerns such as the kinds of work Google engages in. More than 200 workers have signed up to join so far, the group said.“A lot of us employees are feeling disempowered, like we don’t have a say in the direction the company is taking anymore,” said Google software engineer Kimberly Wilber, an activist with the new group. “A union is of our way of building power so executives can’t ignore us.”Google has clashed with some employees in recent years over contracts with the military, a plan for a censored search engine in China, the different treatment of contract workers and a rich exit package for an executive ousted for alleged sexual harassment.“We’ve always worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace,” Kara Silverstein, director of people operations at Google, said in a statement. “Of course our employees have protected labor rights that we support. But as we’ve always done, we’ll continue engaging directly with all our employees.”The new union drew support Monday from U.S. lawmakers including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts who wrote, “I’m in this fight with you all the way.”The effort, a rare campaign within a major U.S. technology company, is supported by the Communications Workers of America, which has been pursuing tech-focused organizing through an initiative known as CODE-CWA. Googlers who join the Alphabet Workers Union will also be members of CWA Local 1400. Members will pay 1% of their total compensation in union dues, which will help fund organizing staff.CWA said the new organization isn’t currently focused on securing formal recognition by Alphabet or collective bargaining with the company, a process that has been aggressively resisted by U.S. corporations.“We might need to see some substantial changes in labor law before that’s a realistic goal,” CWA communications director Beth Allen said. If the union can eventually sign up a majority of Alphabet’s workforce, that would be a “powerful statement,” but the group could effect change even without it, she added. CWA’s membership includes some workers, such as public university employees in Tennessee, who engage in collective action while lacking legal collective bargaining rights.U.S. law grants unionization rights to employees but not to independent contractors, and also makes it more difficult for sub-contracted workers employed by staffing agencies to gain the ability to negotiate directly with a company like Alphabet. Such “temps, vendors and contractors,” known as TVCs, outnumbered Alphabet’s direct employees in 2018 for the first time, Bloomberg reported.Union leaders said on Monday it was crucial that these TVC workers be part of the union as well. “We’re not going to make our growth and collective action dependent on labor law,” said Google software engineer Chewy Shaw, who was recently elected vice chair of the new union.Workers involved in the new union said they saw it as an extension of such efforts, one that could provide a more permanent structure to keep pressure on management, hold the company accountable for promised changes and respond to retaliation against activists. The organization plans to deploy a mix of protests and legislative, regulatory and legal tactics, and to weigh in on issues like antitrust scrutiny of Google. CWA in 2018 joined a coalition urging the Federal Trade Commission to break up Facebook.CWA has been working with Google activists since late 2019, and filed a complaint then with the National Labor Relations Board alleging workers were fired for taking collective action. In December, the agency’s general counsel took up some of those allegations, accusing Google of illegally firing, interrogating and surveilling activist employees. Google has denied wrongdoing, saying it supports workers’ rights and that the employees in question were punished for “serious violation of our policies and an unacceptable breach of a trusted responsibility.”",0.9689

When they contacted Google’s human resources department, each was encouraged to take mental health leave, even when their complaints were unrelated to mental health concerns, according to NBC.The report follows the December firing of Google AI ethics researcher Timnit Gebru, who refused a manager’s request to retract a paper that described the dangers of language models like the ones Google relies on to power its search engine. Gebru wrote an email to the Brain Women and Allies listserv describing her frustration over the paper, and mentioned her doubtsabout Google’s commitments to diversity and inclusion. She says Google told her the email was “inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.” Google’s head of AI claimed Gebru resigned, which she has vehemently disputed.And April Christina Curley, a Black woman who worked as a diversity recruiter for Google, said she was fired in September after being denied promotions and having her pay cut, despite her strong work performance and her successful recruitment of hundreds of students from historically Black colleges and universities to Google’s engineering department.

Baker added, ""We cannot say we believe in diversity, and then ignore the conspicuous absence of many voices from within our walls.""Software engineer Vinesh Kannan said Wednesday on Twitter that he had left the company on Tuesday because Google mistreated Gebru and April Christina Curley, a recruiter who has said she was wrongly fired last year. Both Gebru and Curley identify as Black.""They were wronged,"" Kannan said.Google declined to comment, but pointed to previous statements that it is looking to restore employees' trust after Gebru's departure and that it disputes Curley's accusation.The resignations come as workers have demanded commitments to academic freedom and management change in Google's research organization. More than 800 people joined a union announced last month to advance workplace protections, and more than 2,600 of its 135,000 employees signed a December letter supporting Gebru.Baker, whose resignation letter was shared with an internal affinity group for Black employees, told Reuters he stood by his remarks.Kannan did not have an immediate comment.Gebru, who co-led a team on AI ethics, says she pushed back on orders to pull research that speech technology like Google's could disadvantage marginalized groups.

Anyone there?BY MarketWatch— 10:50 AM ET 07/20/2019Alphabet executives avoided discussing growth slowdown in last earnings report, and numbers don't tell much of a story eitherAlphabet Inc.'s (GOOG) growth is slowing, and analysts don't have a clue as to why because executives aren't talking.As Google's (GOOG) parent company (GOOGL) (GOOGL) nears its fiscal second-quarter results on July 25, the chorus of disapproval about its evasive financial-reporting practices has increased on Wall Street. After releasing disappointing first-quarter results in late April (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/alphabet-stock-drops-after-earnings-show- disappointing-google-sales-growth-2019-04-29), executives were vague, if not outright unresponsive, about slowing growth.For more: Google (GOOG) sales growth is slowing, and it sure would be nice to know why (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ google-sales-growth-is-slowing-and-it-sure-would-be-nice-to-know-why-2019-04-29)""We delivered robust growth led by mobile search, YouTube (GOOG), and Cloud with Alphabet revenues of $36.3 billion, up 17% versus last year, or 19% on a constant currency basis,"" Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in a statement at the time. ""We remain focused on, and excited by, the significant growth opportunities across our businesses.""Deciphering where the revenue fell short was complicated by the way Alphabet structures its segments. There are three major businesses listed on the earnings report: Advertising (which includes search and YouTube (GOOG)); ""Other revenues"" (a mix of hardware, Google Cloud, and its app store); and ""Other Bets"" (a collection of upstart ventures that lose money). That's the extent of the disclosure, which leaves investors in the dark on performance of specific properties like YouTube (GOOG) and Google Cloud.For more: The YouTube (GOOG) and Instagram secret that Google (GOOG) and Facebook don't want you to know (http:// www.marketwatch.com/story/the-youtube-and-instagram-secret-that-google-and-facebook-dont-want-you-to-know-2018-01-26)That wasn't good enough for analysts or investors, who were staring at the slowest sales growth (http:// www.marketwatch.com/story/google-sales-growth-is-slowing-and-it-sure-would-be-nice-to-know-why-2019-04-29) for the online-advertising giant since the fourth quarter of 2015.""A concern for us is the lack of clear communication from management into the cause of the faster-than-expected top- line deceleration,"" SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Youssef Squali wrote in a note, while reducing his price target on Alphabet stock to $1,325 from $1,350. ""The lack of visibility or a clear explanation into the revenue deceleration has left us more cautious than before.""Added Jefferies analyst Brent Thill: ""The continued lack of transparency was troubling to investors."" He maintains a buy rating and price target of $1,450.YouTube (GOOG) might be a culprit, even though Google (GOOG) does not break out revenue for the division despite a suggestion from the Securities and Exchange Commission that it do so.See also:How Google fought the SEC on YouTube (GOOG) revenue disclosure (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-sec-wants-to- know-why-google-doesnt-report-youtube-revenue-2018-02-26)Ironically, the long-shot possibility of the Justice Department seeking a breakup of the company -- Big Tech, also including Apple Inc.

Google Maps, for example, could rake in nearly $10 billion by fiscal 2023, according to UBS analyst Eric Sheridan. Sheridan believes Alphabet is the best-positioned company to grab a slice of the $650 billion global ad market that caters to local merchants as they skew toward digital services for customers with mobile devices.""Given its family of mobile computing utility and media consumption apps (mobile search, Maps, YouTube (GOOG)), we see Alphabet's competitive position and investments as driving out-sized returns as these secular themes move to the forefront of local ad budget planning,"" Sheridan said in a note in early May.What to expect(https://asset.wsj.net/dynamic-insets/charts/cdc_736dfa7c5d2affd9850acc11_embed.html)Earnings: On average, the 39 analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Alphabet to post earnings of $11.10 a share, down from the $11.33 a share expected at the beginning of the quarter (March 31).

(Reuters) - The National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint on Wednesday accusing Alphabet Inc's Google of unlawfully monitoring and questioning several workers who were then fired for protesting against company policies and trying to organize a union.The U.S. labor regulator found Google unlawfully placed employees on administrative leave and terminated them for accessing documents related to how the company polices internal forums, according to the complaint. The agency also found unlawful Google policies for accessing documents and meetings rooms as well as its tactics for investigating employees because all of the efforts were aimed at deterring workplace organizing, the complaint said.At least five people fired after leading efforts to rally colleagues partnered with the Communications Workers of America union to petition the NLRB to challenge Google.One of the fired workers, Laurence Berland, described Wednesday's complaint as significant ""at a time when we're seeing the power of a handful of tech billionaires consolidate control over our lives and our society.""",-0.9837

FLoC has been been widely criticised by privacy advocates, even though it is an improvement to third-party cookies. The Electronic Frontiers Foundation (EFF) calls it a ""terrible idea"" because now Chrome shares a summary of each user's recent browsing activity with marketers.""A browser with FLoC enabled would collect information about its user's browsing habits, then use that information to assign its user to a ""cohort"" or group,"" writes Bennett Cyphers, an EFF technologist. ""Users with similar browsing habits -- for some definition of ""similar"" -- would be grouped into the same cohort. Each user's browser will share a cohort ID, indicating which group they belong to, with websites and advertisers.""Brave, a privacy-focused browser headed up by Mozilla co-founder and key JavaScript designer, Brendan Eich, says it has removed FLoC from the Nightly version of Brave for the desktop and Android. Brave notes the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) and Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as signs that consumers are demanding privacy on the web.""In the face of these trends, it is disappointing to see Google, instead of taking the present opportunity to help design and build a user-first, privacy-first Web, proposing and immediately shipping in Chrome a set of smaller, ad-tech-conserving changes, which explicitly prioritize maintaining the structure of the Web advertising ecosystem as Google sees it,"" Brave says in a blogpost. Brave argues that because the feature does impact user privacy, it should be something that users need to opt-in to. ""Given that FLoC can be harmful for site operators too, we recommend that all sites disable FLoC. In general, any new privacy-risking features on the web should be opt-in,"" Brave says. ""This is a common-sense principle to respect Web users by default. One might wonder why Google isn't making FLoC opt-in. We suspect that Google has made FLoC opt-out (for sites and users) because Google knows that an opt-in, privacy harming system would likely never reach the scale needed to induce advertisers to use it.""",0.9951

A lot of analysts concern about the profit margin will be lower because of TAC cost, which I think it is non-sense issue, As long as the earnings growth rate is over 20% and revenue is over 25%, I am happy. GOOG's PE now stands at around 22 for 2018, which is really low for the still-growth stock like GOOG. If FB can bring in the attractive ads revenue, GOOG is even better, plus GOOG does not have the privacy issue much like FB. GOOG just calms down the government attack by GOING TO WASHINGTON, and soothe all the politicians which has NO CLUE about the MOBILE ADS ADVERTISING.

They are either:* Too risky* An outright scam* Based on faulty logic like stock picking.Firstly I will recommend COINGROWTH Cryptocurrency Investment Platform COINGROWTH.ORG the largest cryptocurrency Investment Platform there is right now (total volume over 4 billion dollars) where you get double of your invested cryptocurrency after 7 days. Supports variety of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. I find that it has a really nice UI and support.You have to remember something. Information is available freely and easily these days.So no matter how much research you do, there are millions of others looking at the same data.So it is highly unlikely you have found an untapped niche. For example, buying a house for $50,000 in a developing market sounds cheap and is cheap. It probably isn't a scam either.There again, why is the house only 50k? It is that price because the market, including loads of institutional investors, have decided it is a fair price given the risk involved.The only get rich quick ideas I have seen work are:a) Illegal.b). Based on luck. If so, most people don't realize it is down to luck, so end up losing it down the road.c). Based on years of hard work. In the case of businesses, I have seen several people work for 5–15 years in a domain (like recruiting, property, law, finance or whatever), who then start their own business. As they don't really need to build up the business assuming their clients trust them and will follow them, it is fairly easy to make revenue quickly.Simple example. A wealth manger has 10million assets under management. Fees are 1%. So 100k. Split 50%-50%, so 50k each. Plus 20k from insurance, so an extra 10k. So 120k total revenue, but 60k in the pocket.If that advisor starts his or her own firm, it is pretty easy for him or her to make 100–120k in year 1, because they could work from their office at home. It depends obviously on any NDA agreements, local laws on insurance and so on. It also depends on the country. Some highly regulated countries are strict on taking clients with you.",0.9968

2879,"Judge in Google Case Disturbed That Even ‘Incognito’ Users Are Tracked(Bloomberg) -- When Google users browse in “Incognito” mode, just how hidden is their activity?The Alphabet Inc. unit says activating the stealth mode in Chrome, or “private browsing” in other browsers, means the company won’t “remember your activity.” But a judge with a history of taking Silicon Valley giants to task about their data collection raised doubts Thursday about whether Google is being as forthright as it needs to be about the personal information it’s collecting from users.At a hearing Thursday in San Jose, California, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh said she’s “disturbed” by Google’s data collection practices in a class-action lawsuit that describes the company’s private browsing promises as a “ruse” and seeks $5,000 in damages for each of the millions of people whose privacy has been compromised since June of 2016.Weighing Google’s attempt to get the suit dismissed, Koh said she finds it “unusual” that the company would make the “extra effort” of data collection if it doesn’t use the information to build user profiles or targeted advertising.Google has become a target antitrust complaints in the last year filed by state and federal officials -- as well as businesses -- accusing it of abusing its dominance in digital advertising and online search. Koh has a deeper history with the company as a vocal critic of its privacy policies. She forced Google in one notable case to disclose its scanning of emails to build profiles and target advertising.In this case, Google is accused of relying on pieces of its code within websites that use its analytics and advertising services to scrape users’ supposedly private browsing history and send copies of it to Google’s servers. Google makes it seem like private browsing mode gives users more control of their data, Amanda Bonn, a lawyer representing users, told Koh. In reality, “Google is saying there’s basically very little you can do to prevent us from collecting your data, and that’s what you should assume we’re doing,” Bonn said.Andrew Schapiro, a lawyer for Google, argued the company’s privacy policy “expressly discloses” its practices. “The data collection at issue is disclosed,” he said.Another lawyer for Google, Stephen Broome, said website owners who contract with the company to use its analytics or other services are well aware of the data collection described in the suit.Broome’s attempt to downplay the privacy concerns by pointing out that the federal court system’s own website uses Google services ended up backfiring.The judge demanded an explanation “about what exactly Google does,” while voicing concern that visitors to the court’s website are unwittingly disclosing information to the company.“I want a declaration from Google on what information they’re collecting on users to the court’s website, and what that’s used for,” Koh told the company’s lawyers.",0.9909
2880,"Google (Alphabet) is an amazing stock to buy, in my opinion, for these reasons:1. Strong revenue growth with an expected growth of 23.9% for 20212. Low forward P/E ratio of 26, considering it continues to have double digit revenue growth3. The market for Google search, YouTube and Google Cloud will continue to have strong growth, in my opinion, as Google search seems to be essential in almost every aspect of life. YouTube also continues to produce top quality content for every niche category you can think of and will help eliminate cable in conjunction with Netflix, in my opinion.4. Alphabet’s financial statements are incredible with strong revenue growth 12.77% in 2020 even when it was in a worst-case scenario with lockdowns and reduced advertising budgets. Google’s paid clicks for advertising was up 19% in and impressions were up 15% in 2020. 5. The company is highly profitable and has an incredible balance sheet with $136.7 billion of cash and marketable securities.6. Alphabet stock seems like such a safe investment, in my opinion, compared to many other high flying tech stocks trading at 50+ forward P/E ratios. I sleep very well at night holding Alphabet in my stock portfolio.As with every company, Google stock also has some risks. There is a risk of government intervention on how Google collects and uses its customers data and there is a risk the government may try to break up the company which I believe is unlikely to happen.

Last July, Google responded to criticism by introducing a 21-day verification process for businesses promoting financial products.If advertisers fail to prove their legitimacy within this window, they will be given a seven-day notice period before the ad is paused.Firms cannot restart their ads until verification is complete. Google updated this policy in December, allowing it to pause suspicious ads during the verification window.But the City watchdog and campaigners including Which? have called on Google to verify all ads before they go live, because scammers can run riot within weeks.Even though Google paused our fake advert after five days, following a warning from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), our results show thousands of victims could have been scammed during that time.Gareth Shaw, head of money at Which?, says: 'People should be able to trust that the adverts they see online are legitimate, especially from a reputable company like Google.

The ruling came after last week's oral hearing before a three-judge panel at the Federal Circuit and pending an appeal granted by the Supreme Court of the U.S., the decision is final and binding on future cases.""For ten years Netlist has steadfastly opposed Google's misguided campaign to invalidate the ‘912 patent,"" said Netlist's CEO, C.K. Hong. ""We are very pleased that in the end the appellate court made it clear that the claims of this seminal patent are indeed valid and in so doing, further vindicate our decade-long defense of the company's strategic intellectual property. We will now move to lift the stay in the patent infringement lawsuit against Google in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of CA., in order to recover current and past damages related to the ‘912 patent.""In response to Netlist's 2009 complaint, Google first filed its petition for reexamination of the '912 patent in 2010 and was later joined in its effort by Inphi and Smart Modular. On January 31, 2019 PTAB denied Google's request for a rehearing of the PTAB's previous decision upholding the validity of the '912 patent claims. The PTAB's extensive rehearing decision adopted Netlist's positions on the claims and rejected Google's invalidity arguments involving the specific use of rank-selecting signals for rank multiplication.Netlist believes that the teachings of the '912 patent can be found in various DDR3 and DDR4 server DIMMs (Dual Inline Memory Module) as well as future products that will be produced under the DDR5 server DIMM standards currently being established by the industry.",0.9949

(https://bit.ly/3ge5RjX)A setting to control web and application activity, when turned on, also enabled Google to collect, store and use the data and was turned on by default on the devices.Users were not informed that turning off location history but leaving the ""Web & App Activity"" setting on would allow Google to continue to collect data, the court found.The court will need to decide what it considers a breach and how many occurred but the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC) quoted the ACCC chairman Rod Simms as saying that the regulator would seek a penalty in the ""many millions"".A Google spokesman said the company was reviewing its options.",0.958

3071,"DOJ likely to file Google antitrust suit with no Democratic supportThe suit, the first major monopolization case in decades, comes as both Republican and Democratic politicians have been berating Google and other massive tech companies like Facebook and Apple about their outsize influence over the U.S. economy and their treatment of competitors.The Justice Department has been negotiating for months with a group of attorneys general from 48 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia about whether they can combine their separate investigations into a unified complaint against Google over its search engine. A strong backing from Democratic AGs could have helped the case make the transition to a Joe Biden administration if the former vice president wins the White House next month.While some Republican attorneys general have signed onto the Justice Department complaint, others have joined Democratic AGs in a group that is moving ahead with a separate complaint against Google, the people said, speaking anonymously to discuss the ongoing investigations.That bipartisan group of states expects to file an antitrust complaint challenging Google’s search practices at a later date, the people said. That group, led by Democratic attorneys general in Colorado and Iowa along with Nebraska’s Republican attorney general, has expressed concern about what they view as the Justice Department’s narrow approach to the case, the people said. Filing a separate suit would allow more leverage if the DOJ negotiates a settlement with Google they don’t like, they said.The Trump DOJ had hoped to entice Democratic-led states to sign on to the complaint in the hopes of avoiding claims that politics played a part in the suit's filing. Up to now, the Google investigations have proceeded on a bipartisan basis with prosecutors from the Justice Department and nearly every U.S. state.A third antitrust complaint, headed by Texas, that focuses on Google’s power in the advertising technology market is likely to be filed in the coming weeks. That suit has been complicated by bribery and improper influence allegations against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. The Justice Department is separately investigating Google’s control in the ad tech industry and could file its own case or join in Texas’s suit.Spokespeople for Google and the Justice Department both declined to comment.The number of states that will sign on to the Justice Department’s search complaint next week is unknown, as are its exact contents. Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, a Republican leader of the Google probe, however, has said he plans to join the DOJ suit and criticized state leaders who don’t plan to sign on. Landry and attorneys general for eight other Republican-led states met with Attorney General William Barr to discuss the suit last month and are viewed as the most likely candidates to join the DOJ complaint, the people said.The complaint is likely to include allegations that Google has used.",0.9982

Therefore we can conclude that GOOGL even at these levels trades at a significant discount to fair value. Overall this name is very attractive from both a growth and valuation standpoint.

3213,"Google sued for exposing COVID-19 contact tracing data to third partiesA lawsuit has been filed against Google by individuals who used California’s public health COVID-19 contact tracing app, claiming it exposed their data and violated privacy laws.Two individuals who used California’s state public health COVID-19 contact tracing app have filed a lawsuit against its developer, Google, claiming the tool exposes user data and violated their privacy, among other allegations.At the time of the announcement in April 2020, Google provided a detailed plan of its privacy policies that included a requirement of explicit user consent, along with a list of frequently asked questions to reiterate the companies’ privacy policies.Those policies included ensuring the generation of tracking keys linked to the user’s device were randomized, instead of mathematically pulling the data from the user’s private key. The tech companies also pledged to disable the service once the pandemic had been contained.The announcement was met with a host of concerns from a range of privacy stakeholders, particularly around user consent and the heavy reliance on APIs. The National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) stressed that the apps may not sufficiently protect the personal information of consumers.The lawsuit, filed in the US District Court of Northern California in San Jose, alleges the app confirmed those concerns.“Because Google’s implementation of GAEN allows this sensitive contact tracing data to be placed on a device’s system logs and provides dozens or even hundreds of third parties access to these system logs, Google has exposed GAEN participants’ private personal and medical information associated with contact tracing, including notifications to Android device users of their potential exposure to COVID-19,” according to the lawsuit.Specifically, the lawsuit alleges that the app’s use of “rolling proximity identifiers” on devices’ Bluetooth radio is recorded by Google’s GMS records, which “unwittingly expose[d] not only their information to numerous third parties, but also information from unsuspecting GAEN users on other devices (including non-Android devices, such as iPhones) who come within range of them.”Further, the identifiers are maintained along other device identifiers and stored to mobile device system logs, it’s then available to third parties that have access to those logs. And as the exposed information is personally identifiable, the information can be used to trace the identifier back to user identities, locations, and other identifiers.“For those who have reported testing positive, it enables third parties to link that diagnosis back to the particular patient, defeating the purported anonymity Google claims for its service,” the lawsuit claims.",0.9477

3283,"It's not just a social media problem – how search engines spread misinformationSearch engines are one of society’s primary gateways to information and people, but they are also conduits for misinformation. Similar to problematic social media algorithms, search engines learn to serve you what you and others have clicked on before. Because people are drawn to the sensational, this dance between algorithms and human nature can foster the spread of misinformation.Search engine companies, like most online services, make money not only by selling ads, but also by tracking users and selling their data through real-time bidding on it. People are often led to misinformation by their desire for sensational and entertaining news as well as information that is either controversial or confirms their views. One study found that more popular YouTube videos about diabetes are less likely to have medically valid information than less popular videos on the subject, for instance.Ad-driven search engines, like social media platforms, are designed to reward clicking on enticing links because it helps the search companies boost their business metrics. As a researcher who studies the search and recommendation systems, I and my colleagues show that this dangerous combination of corporate profit motive and individual susceptibility makes the problem difficult to fix.Famous but fake spidersIn 2018, searches for “new deadly spider” spiked on Google following a Facebook post that claimed a new deadly spider killed several people in multiple states. My colleagues and I analyzed the top 100 results from Google search for “new deadly spider” during the first week of this trending query.It turned out this story was fake, but people searching for it were largely exposed to misinformation related to the original fake post. As people continued clicking and sharing that misinformation, Google continued serving those pages at the top of the search results.This pattern of thrilling and unverified stories emerging and people clicking on them continues, with people apparently either being unconcerned with the truth or believing that if a trusted service such as Google Search is showing these stories to them then the stories must be true. More recently, a disproven report claiming China let the coronavirus leak from a lab gained traction on search engines because of this vicious cycle.Questions of Big Tech regulation and self-regulation aside, it’s important for people to understand how these systems work and how they make money. Otherwise market economies and people’s natural inclination to be attracted to eye-catching links will keep the vicious cycle going.",0.9971

Google is in a very dominant position on the Internet and some underestimate its potential. If its leadership does it right, it can blow Shopify and compete aggressively with Amazon. Amazon has few huge warehouse. Google can take advantage of the numerous and closer to clients stores to make a more attractive offer to Amazon. Should Google buy Shopify? I thought so before, but now I think that they would be better developing their own merchant tools instead of paying for the overvalued Shopify stock. Imagine shopping on Google and putting all the items in the same cart, paying once, and Google sends the specific item orders to every store involved, and delivered buy the store employees or Uber (eventually Waymo)!

The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) and the Center for Digital Democracy (CDD) said they plan to file a complaint with the FTC Wednesday asking regulators to investigate how the Google Play Store promotes apps for kids.The groups say three recent studies, including one conducted by the American Medical Association last year, found that more than two-thirds of apps – 67% – used by kids age 5 and under were transmitting information to third-party advertisers.""If you’re under 13, your data is not supposed to be shared with advertisers, but that’s happening routinely, and at scale on the apps on Google Play,"" Josh Golin, the CCFC's executive director, told USA TODAY. Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, a Democrat who authored the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, known as COPPA, said in a statement that while he's both ""disturbed, but not surprised"" that it remains a problem.""Children are spending an unprecedented amount of time on their devices right now, and they shouldn’t be tracked at every turn,"" Markey said. ""That has to stop. It’s time for Big Tech to be held accountable for prioritizing profits over privacy, particularly when it comes to our children.”Parents have become increasingly concerned about how to keep kids safe on the internet during the pandemic when screens are in such heavy use. In 2019, Google's YouTube agreed to provide new protections for children and paid a $170 million fine to settle a year-long investigation by the FTC and the New York state attorney general into complaints from consumer groups that it illegally collected data from children under the age of 13 children to target advertising.The new complaint comes amid increased government scrutiny of the tech giants. Google faces antitrust lawsuits from the Justice Department and separate coalitions of states.

3520,"US privacy, consumer, competition and civil rights groups urge ban on ‘surveillance advertising’A coalition of organizations across the privacy, antitrust, consumer protection and civil rights spaces has called for a ban on “surveillance advertising”, further amplifying the argument that “big tech’s toxic business model is undermining democracy”.The close to 40-strong coalition behind this latest call to ban “creepy ads” which rely on the mass tracking and profiling of web users in order to target them with behavioral ads. “As leaders across a broad range of issues and industries, we are united in our concern for the safety of our communities and the health of democracy,” they write in the open letter. “Social media giants are eroding our consensus reality and threatening public safety in service of a toxic, extractive business model. That’s why we’re joining forces in an effort to ban surveillance advertising.”The coalition is keen to point out that less toxic non-tracking alternatives (like contextual ads) exist, while arguing that greater transparency and oversight of adtech infrastructure could help clean up a range of linked problems, from junk content and rising conspiracism to ad fraud and denuded digital innovation.“There is no silver bullet to remedy this crisis — and the members of this coalition will continue to pursue a range of different policy approaches, from comprehensive privacy legislation to reforming our antitrust laws and liability standards,” they write. “But here’s one thing we all agree on: It’s time to ban surveillance advertising.”“Big Tech platforms amplify hate, illegal activities, and conspiracism — and feed users increasingly extreme content — because that’s what generates the most engagement and profit,” they warn.“Their own algorithmic tools have boosted everything from white supremacist groups and Holocaust denialism to COVID-19 hoaxes, counterfeit opioids and fake cancer cures. Echo chambers, radicalization, and viral lies are features of these platforms, not bugs — central to the business model.”The coalition also warns over surveillance advertising’s impact on the traditional news business, noting that shrinking revenues for professional journalism is raining more harm down upon the (genuine) information ecosystem democracies need to thrive.“Facebook and Google’s monopoly power and data harvesting practices have given them an unfair advantage, allowing them to dominate the digital advertising market, siphoning up revenue that once kept local newspapers afloat. So while Big Tech CEOs get richer, journalists get laid off,” the coalition warns, adding: “Big Tech will continue to stoke discrimination, division, and delusion — even if it fuels targeted violence or lays the groundwork for an insurrection — so long as it’s in their financial interest.”Among a laundry list of harms the coalition is linking to the dominant ad-based online business models of tech giants Facebook and Google is the funding of what they describe as “insidious misinformation sites that promote medical hoaxes, conspiracy theories, extremist content, and foreign propaganda”.“Banning surveillance advertising would restore transparency and accountability to digital ad placements, and substantially defund junk sites that serve as critical infrastructure in the disinformation pipeline,” they argue, adding: “These sites produce an endless drumbeat of made-to-go-viral conspiracy theories that are then boosted by bad-faith social media influencers and the platforms’ engagement-hungry algorithms — a toxic feedback loop fueled and financed by surveillance advertising.”Other harms they point to are the risks posed to public health by platforms’ amplification of junk/bogus content such as COVID-19 conspiracy theories and vaccine misinformation; the risk of discrimination through unfairly selective and/or biased ad targeting, such as job ads that illegally exclude women or ethnic minorities; and the perverse economic incentives for ad platforms to amplify extremist/outrageous content in order to boost user engagement with content and ads, thereby fuelling societal division and driving partisanship as a byproduct of the fact platforms benefit financially from more content being spread.The coalition also argues that the surveillance advertising system is “rigging the game against small businesses” because it embeds platform monopolies — which is a neat counterpoint to tech giants’ defensive claim that creepy ads somehow level the playing field for SMEs versus larger brands.“While Facebook and Google portray themselves as lifelines for small businesses, the truth is they’re simply charging monopoly rents for access to the digital economy,” they write, arguing that the duopoly’s “surveillance-driven stranglehold over the ad market leaves the little guys with no leverage or choice” — opening them up to exploitation by big tech.",-0.9923

Other are not. Something that fan club love.2.> Big player know it's way inflated. They love it. They pushing trend follower to these two and other such stocks. While reduce them from quality companies.

But my prediction this will happen. AMZN and GOOGL right now have $425 difference. I think in year or so this likely <$200, Could be negative.Same with NFLX, it likely trade lower than $NVDA (Also might $FB) in year out.

3647,"Google antitrust lawsuit amended to target Chrome’s Privacy SandboxAn antitrust lawsuit against Google has been amended to take into account changes to ad tracking in Chrome. Texas attorney general Ken Paxton announced the multi-state suit, which focuses on Google's advertising tech, in December. Meanwhile, five more attorneys general (from Alaska, Florida, Montana, Nevada and Puerto Rico) have joined the lawsuit, for a total of 15.The AGs claim that Google harnessed its dominant market positions in search, video and other areas to kill off smaller ad networks and effectively require advertisers to use its platform. The updated suit includes a section about Google's Privacy Sandbox, which is partly about using anonymized data to deliver relevant ads to large groups. Google plans to block third-party tracking cookies in Chrome by 2022.The lawsuit accuses Google of hiding ""its true intentions behind a pretext of privacy"" and suggests that the changes put ""Google’s Chrome browser at the center of tracking and targeting. ""It notes Google's plans to ""disable the primary cookie-tracking technology almost all non-Google publishers currently use to track users and target ads"" and argues that the move would force ""pressure advertisers to shift to Google money otherwise spent on smaller publishers,"" such as local newspapers.""Attorney General Paxton’s latest claims mischaracterize many aspects of our business, including the steps we are taking with the Privacy Sandbox initiative to protect people’s privacy as they browse the web,"" Google told Engadget in a statement. ""These efforts have been welcomed by privacy advocates, advertisers and our own rivals as a step forward in preserving user privacy and protecting free content.

3872,"Good infoNetlist - High stakes patent litigationNetlist is taking on giants Google and SK Hynix and finds itself with the upper hand. Agni Research15 hr ago 3 1 THESISNote: This is outside our normal focus on biotech stocks. A member of another forum we are part of brought this stock to our attention. We got interested in the stock for its strong risk-reward profile. Netlist (OTC: NLST) is suing several large manufacturers of server memory products for infringement of its patents. Most notably, Google, SK Hynix, and Inphi.RESEARCHThis is straight from the investor portion of Netlist’s website describing the company’s mission: Netlist provides high-performance SSDs and modular memory subsystems to enterprise customers in diverse industries. The Company's NVMe SSD portfolio provides industry-leading performance offered in multiple capacities and form factors. HybriDIMM, Netlist's next-generation storage class memory product, addresses the growing need for real-time analytics in Big Data applications, in-memory databases, high-performance computing and advanced data storage solutions. Netlist also manufactures a line of specialty and legacy memory products to storage customers, appliance customers, system builders and cloud and datacenter customers. Netlist holds a portfolio of patents in the areas of server memory, hybrid memory, storage class memory, rank multiplication and load reduction.Netlist has been in litigation with Google since 2009 over allegations that Google infringed upon Netlist’s seminal 912 patent. It is a hardware patent for processing commands in an LRDIMM memory module using rank multiplication. Google signed an NDA to take a look at it. It passed on using the technology described in the patent. Netlist alleges that Google infringed the patent by building servers using the 912 patent technology. Netlist sued Google on December 2009 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. The judge in the case ordered a random cross section of servers to be examined which showed that Google indeed was using technology described in the 912 patent. Google then asserted that the patent was invalid. In 2010 Google requested an Inter Partes Reexamination of the 912 patent by the USPTO’s (United States Patent and Trademark Office) PTAB (Patent Trial and Appeal Board). While the reexamination was going on the Northern District Court granted a joint request made by both companies to stay the 912 patent infringement lawsuit until the USPTO made its findings. On January 2019 the PTAB upheld the validity of Netlist’s 912 patent. In April 2019 Google appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In June 2020 the US Court of Appeals upheld the PTAB’s decision on the validity of the 912 patent. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic Google was granted a 6 month extension to decide if it wanted to appeal this decision to the United States Supreme Court. Google did not choose to appeal. On February 16, 2021 Netlist moved to lift the stay in the Northern District of California so the patent infringement lawsuit could continue. The Court granted the request and ordered that both Netlist and Google shall appear for a telephone Case Management Conference on March 11, 2021. At least 7 calendar days prior to the conference, the parties shall meet and confer and file a Joint Case Management Conference Settlement that sets forth the status of the case and proposes a schedule.So why is the 912 patent a big deal? It is a seminal patent. A seminal patent is defined as a patent that describes an invention so impactful that it creates or shifts the technology space. Netlist believes that the teachings of the 912 patent can be found in various DDR3 and DDR4 server DIMMs (Dual Inline Memory Module) as well as future products that will be produced under the DDR5 server DIMM standards currently being established by the industry. Furthermore, Netlist asserts that the 912 patent enabled Google to build servers with high capacity and rapid memory that allowed said servers to store an entire Oracle database in memory which allowed lightning fast search results. The 912 patent played a large part in Google’s dominance in search. Right now, it is not a question whether Google infringed the 912 patent. That has already been established. Now, Google is at the stage where it can settle with Netlist or go to a jury trial to determine damages. As for the damages, Netlist will most likely use a hedonic pricing model to determine the damages. Hedonic pricing looks at both the product itself (internal factors) and the environment (external factors) in determining pricing. In this case Netlist will argue that the 912 patent established Google’s dominance in search, which allowed monopolist profits that funded Google’s entire ecosystem. While at the same time, Google’s infringement of the patent prevented Netlist from establishing itself in the server memory marketplace.",0.9996

They could announce a special 1-time or recurring (or both) dividend. * They could announce they're spinning off Waymo, or YouTube or their quantum computing segment.There's an awful lot that Google can do to boost the stock price at anytime so it'll be interesting to see what happens on Tuesday afternoon.

3890,"Judge Denied Google Request to Move State Antitrust LawsuitU.S. District Judge Sean Jordan in Plano, Texas, on Thursday denied Google’s request to transfer the case to California, according to a court filing.The judge said Google had failed to establish that California is a more convenient venue and said that moving it could cause unnecessary delay by combining it with pending class-action lawsuits against the company.The Texas lawsuit, filed by 14 states led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, is one three government cases accusing the company of abusing monopoly power. The U.S. Justice Department and a group of states are targeting Google’s search business, while the Texas complaint focuses on digital advertising.Google had argued that the Texas case mirrors lawsuits filed against it in California, potentially leading to conflicting court decisions. It also said California is a more convenient venue for witnesses who might testify at trial.The states countered that the case should remain in Texas because there are publishers, advertisers and consumers in the state affected by Google’s advertising business. The Texas court also has a track record of moving cases to trial more quickly than the federal court in San Francisco, they said.",0.9426

CherneyGoogle cloud now a fifth the size of Amazon Web ServicesAlphabet Inc.'s earnings Thursday after the bell contained something of a surprising detail: Its Google cloud unit is banking $1 billion a quarter in sales.Though that's a small portion of the company's overall $32.32 billion in revenue, it's a fast-growing chunk. And it's the first time in years executives have broken out cloud specifically. Usually, cloud is grouped into ""Google Other"" with the company's hardware and Play Store sales, which logged sales of $4.69 billion in the fourth quarter -- including the cloud unit -- an increase from $3.4 billion in the year-earlier period.During the company's third-quarter conference call, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said she listed the Google Other business segments in order from greatest to least contributor.

4059,"The Creepy Way Facebook, Google And Amazon Profit Off Our Private DataOur lives and habits are being tracked. Every time we tap in a Google search, every time we click “Like” on Facebook and every time we make an Amazon purchase, we are giving away information about ourselves: our thoughts, our preferences, our behaviors.We are providing data that can be packaged up and sold to companies, which then use that data to try to modify our behavior and steer us toward buying products or using their services.Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff calls it the commodification of human data. In the information era we live in, she explains in her new book, “The Age Of Surveillance Capitalism,” we are the marketable product. It’s a terrifying idea.So, what is surveillance capitalism?It’s important to know that in many ways, surveillance capitalism differs dramatically from other forms of capitalism over the last couple of centuries. Capitalism is claiming things that live outside the marketplace, bringing them into the market and turning them into what people call “commodities,” things that can be sold and purchased.Industrial capitalism, which dominated the late 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, famously claimed nature. The trees and the forests and the rivers — these are entities that have a life of their own. Industrial capitalism brought nature into the market dynamic, and nature was reborn. It was called “land,” and it was called “real estate.” That allowed it to be sold and purchased and become the source of profit.Surveillance capitalism proceeds according to this pattern, but with a dark and unexpected twist. So unexpected, in fact, that it’s taken us quite a while to catch on to what they’ve actually done. Surveillance capitalism claims private human experience for the market dynamic.It says that private human experience is now a source of free, raw material — just like harvesting wheat or collecting ore from a mountain side. [We are] a source of free, raw material that can be processed into data, and those data can be computed and sold and purchased and owned.That sequence has created the largest, wealthiest and most powerful companies — like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon — that the world has ever known. All of that begins with the unilateral declaration that private human experience is ours for the taking.Ultimately, what surveillance capitalists are trying to do is sell predictions. It’s not only to know our behavior, but it’s to predict our behavior. That’s how they make their money.Those predictions are not to improve our lives, but rather they’re sold to business customers who have a business interest in knowing what we will do next — because that raises the certainty that they have about how to successfully get us to behave in a way that serves their bottom line.",0.9948

The weight of this first-hand testimony, along with supporting government documentation and other evidence, established without any doubt the reality of these phenomena. These individuals offered to give sworn testimony to Congress about their encounters, but Congress has refused to hear them.

It’s proposing that the sharing of information be done only with its in-house counsel. It also wants advance notice if the information is used in other matters, according to a Justice Department filing in Washington federal court Friday.“Adopting Google’s proposal would undermine third parties’ confidence in the treatment of their confidential information, chill third-party cooperation in current and future government investigations, and unfairly advantage Google in the marketplace if third-party confidential information is disclosed or used,” the U.S. said in the filing.The judge in the case has given companies including Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp., Amazon Inc., AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp. until Nov. 20 to stake out a position on restricting their information that may shared by the government with Google during the litigation. The companies called it a “serious concern” in a joint filing, saying they have produced some of their “most sensitive internal business materials.”",0.9736

4290,"The Chromium-based Vivaldi browser banned Google’s FLoCGoogle’s new tracking method FLoC continues to see opposition grow, as Vivaldi labels the new tracking system as 'privacy-invasive' and 'nasty'. The Chromium-based Vivaldi browser has removed FLoC, Google's controversial alternative identifier to third-party cookies for tracking users across websites.FLoC, or Federated Learning of Cohorts, has just been released by Google for Chrome as its answer to improving privacy while still delivering targeted ads.But Vivaldi has called it a ""dangerous step that harms user privacy"".""Google's new data harvesting venture is nasty,"" it declared in a blog post that begins with the header ""FLoC off! Vivaldi does not support FLoC"".""At Vivaldi, we stand up for the privacy rights of our users. We do not approve tracking and profiling, in any disguise. We certainly would not allow our products to build up local tracking profiles.""It presents FLoC as part of a set of so-called 'privacy' technologies, but let's remove the pretence here; FLoC is a privacy-invasive tracking technology.""Vivaldi is based on Chromium. But while it relies on the Chromium engine to render pages correctly, it said this is where Vivaldi's similarities with Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers end.It said the FLoC experiment does not work in Vivaldi as it relies on some hidden settings that are not enabled in Vivaldi.The FLoC component in Chrome needs to call Google's servers to check if it can function since Google is only enabling it in parts of the world that are not covered by Europe's GDPR. As the blog explained, Vivaldi does not allow such a call to be made to Google.""We will not support the FLoC API and plan to disable it, no matter how it is implemented. It does not protect privacy and it certainly is not beneficial to users, to unwittingly give away their privacy for the financial gain of Google,"" it said. FLoC has been widely criticised by privacy advocates, even though it is an improvement to third-party cookies. The Electronic Frontiers Foundation (EFF) called it a ""terrible idea"" because now Chrome shares a summary of each user's recent browsing activity with marketers. As Vivaldi explained, an ad company could previously only see the aspects of a user's personality relating to the websites where its ads were used. An ad provider that was only used for 1,000 websites might only have seen each visitor on one or two of their sites, so they could not build up much tracking data about a user.""FLoC changes this completely. Its core design involves sharing new information with advertisers,"" it continued. ""Now every website will get to see an ID that was generated from your behaviour on every other website.""You might visit a website that relates to a highly personal subject that may or may not use FLoC ads, and now every other site that you visit gets told your FLoC ID, which shows that you have visited that specific kind of site.""FLoC, Vivaldi said, has very serious implications for people who live in an environment where aspects of their personality are persecuted, such as their sexuality, political viewpoint, or religion.""All can become a part of your FLoC ID,"" it said.""This is no longer about privacy but goes beyond. It crosses the line into personal safety.""We reject FLoC. You should too.""",0.9979

During the last days of the 2016 Presidential campaign, Trump ran an add in California about returning the government to the people. It briefly displayed a photo of David Rockefeller. What are their plans? See the comments below by two of their leaders: Zbigniew Brzezinski and David Rockefeller. These comments should scare anyone!For those who downplay or mock concerns about the power, dealings, pervasiveness or agenda of the shadow government, consider the following.If the recent Sixty Minutes revelation that the deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, and the assistant attorney general of the United States, Rod Rosenstein, conspired to recruit cabinet members to impeach Trump shortly after his election as well as comments by 3 FBI officials disclosing in private emails that they had a plan to deal with Trump didn't bother you, then consider these comments by two leading members of the Trilateral Commission, especially the last one by David Rockefeller citing collusion by the national Press to keep the shadow government from the public:“The technotronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite, unrestrained by traditional values. Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files containing even the most personal information about the citizen. These files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities""-Zbigniew Brzezinski, Between Two Ages: America's Role in the Technetronic Era""This regionalization is in keeping with the Tri-Lateral Plan which calls for a gradual convergence of East and West, ultimately leading toward the goal of one world government”-Zbigniew Brzezinski""Shortly, the public will be unable to reason or think for themselves. They'll only be able to parrot the information they've been given on the previous night's news""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""People, governments and economies of all nations must serve the needs of multinational banks and corporations""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""The society will be dominated by an elite of persons free from traditional values who will have no doubt in fulfilling their objectives by means of purged techniques with which they will influence the behavior of people and will control and watch the society in all details. It will become possible to exert a practically permanent watch on each citizen of the world""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""The nation state as a fundamental unit of man's organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force: International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation-state""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure - one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.""-David Rockefeller""We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a World Government.The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past centuries""-David RockefellerIMHO-The elites want Trump impeached, because unlike Jimmy Carter, George Bush I, the Clintons, etc., they cannot control him and he is a threat to their plans.We have met the primary enemy and they is us!",0.9933

It alleges Google quietly teams with its closest online advertising competitor, Facebook Inc, and that it uses the excuse of protecting users' privacy to act unfairly.

More than a dozen progressive groups published an open letter to President-elect Joe Biden on Tuesday, urging him not to appoint people with ""close ties to Google,"" including the tech giant's former CEO Eric Schmidt, to senior roles in his administration.The 14 progressive groups — including The Revolving Door Project, a group which scrutinizes the appointments of executives in office — urged Biden to take a ""hard line against the influence of individuals with close ties to Google.""The groups wrote that they ""want to ensure that the internet isn't dominated by a handful of corporations and remains free and open.""The Financial Times reported November 8 that Schmidt was being discussed as a possible lead for a new technology industry task force in the White House, without describing its sources.Biden has not publicly discussed a role for Schmidt, and Silicon Valley sources close to the Biden team told Recode Tuesday they weren't aware of any plans to appoint Schmidt. One source familiar with the matter also said the Biden transition team had not discussed a planned role for Schmidt.A spokesperson for Schmidt declined to comment to Business Insider.The letter, also signed by the Open Markets Institute, the Communications Workers of America, the Action Center on Race & the Economy, and others, said an appointment for Schmidt would alienate ""an overwhelming majority of the electorate ... who want to see the economic power of major corporations reined in.""""In reviewing your transition's disclosure of its agency review teams, we were struck and concerned by the apparent widespread influence of people with close professional ties to Google generally and more specifically Eric Schmidt, a former CEO of Google with a current multi-billion dollar stake in the company,"" the groups said. The groups referenced the antitrust lawsuit filed against Google by the Department of Justice on October 20. The case argues that Google disadvantaged competitors through a network of exclusionary business deals, and is the tech giant's largest legal challenge yet.Having Schmidt in a senior US government position ""could have a chilling effect on US antimonopoly policy moving forward,"" they said.The letter said appointing Schmidt would risk ""fracturing a Democratic coalition"" and ""alienating an overwhelming majority of the electorate.""The groups also pointed to the news that Schmidt was reportedly obtaining citizenship in the European island, Cyprus, per Recode, allowing him to travel to the European Union and possibly reap tax benefits. Schmidt declined to comment to Recode at the time.In light of this news, appointing Schmidt would send a ""dangerous message"" during a time of ""historic wealth inequality,"" the groups said.Schmidt has a net worth of about $15 billion and is one of the wealthiest people on the planet.The groups also referenced a survey by the organization Demand Progress, in which more than half of people agreed Biden should refuse to appoint any individuals with ties to Big Tech companies that are being sued by the Department of Justice.""The American people are divided on many things, but not on what they view as fundamental issues of legal and economic justice like this one,"" they said.",0.9856

Now, as a competitor I would much more prefer to pay to have ALSO my company's (another company offering same/similar products) to pop up on that persons screen, wouldn't I.In essence, companies are paying Google for ads that have ALREADY been seen and checked out!Google needs to fix to give more value to advertisers!",0.862

The stock has underperformed the market when compared to the S&P 500 over the last 50 trading days. The MACD-LT is confirming that the intermediate-term trend is bearish. GOOGL's chart formation indicates the stock is in a strong downward trend. Over the last 50 trading sessions, there has been more volume on down days than on up days indicating that GOOGL is under distribution, which is a bearish condition. The stock is trading below a falling 50-day moving average which confirms the weak technical condition of GOOGL.""",-0.9047

5201,"Consumer Watchdog and Privacy Rights Clearinghouse filed a complaint Thursday regarding the alterations Google made to its privacy policy in June. The complaint, which was made public Monday, requested that the Federal Trade Commission review the matter. The privacy groups said the changes violate deceptive-practices law and a previous FTC order. The complaint involves Google’s June request for users to opt-in to new privacy settings that enable Google to combine browsing histories with search histories. The alteration reversed a 10-year-old policy at Google keep user data separate between its search and its DoubleClick business, the latter which aids advertisers in placing ads on third-party websites. “This announcement intentionally misled users, who had no way to discern from the wording that Google was breaking from a nearly decade-old practice and asking them if it could link their personal information to data reflecting their behavior on as many as 80 percent of the internet’s leading websites,” the complaint stated.The complaint continued, “A reasonable user would have been left with precisely the impression Google was seeking to leave: that the 2016 change was to their benefit and posed no risk to their privacy. In reality, the policy change marked the consummation of a deceptive path that Google had methodically charted since it first sought to acquire DoubleClick in 2007.”Google responded in a statement obtained by the Wall Street Journal on Monday. The company said that it changed the policy “to match the way people use Google today: across many different devices,” and that “it is 100 percent optional — if users do not opt-in to these changes, their Google experience will remain unchanged.”The FTC has received the complaint and is “closely reviewing it,” per the Journal report. Google was harshly criticized when it acquired DoubleClick for $3.1 billion in 2007. Privacy activists were concerned that the company would combine data from users’ search histories with browsing history to create “super profiles” of consumers. At the time of the deal, Google said it would keep DoubleClick data separate from data it collected through search, maps and Gmail.“Google is a serial privacy violator,” John M. Simpson, Consumer Watchdog’s Privacy Project Director, said in Monday’s press release. “For the last decade they pretended to care about your privacy, but amassed ever growing amounts of data about you. Remember, you’re not their customer. You are Google’s product.”",0.6634

5395,"An anonymous product manager filed a lawsuit Tuesday accusing Google of having an internal “spying program.”The lawsuit, filed in the San Francisco Superior Court, claims the Mountain View-based company violates California Labor Laws by maintaining strict confidentiality policies, according to a report out from The Information. The suit said that Google encourages employees to report fellow workers who leak information.The plaintiff also said the company threatens to fire anyone who leaks information and does not permit internal workplace discussion about wages or legal violations. Google goes so far as to prohibit employees from writing a novel about working at a tech company in Silicon Valley without the company’s permission, per the complaint.So what’s considered confidential material at Google? According to the lawsuit, confidential information is classified as ""everything at Google."" The policy allegedly prevents employees from talking about workplace conditions with the ""press, members of the investment community, partners, or anyone else outside of Google,"" per The Information.Google defended itself against accusations Monday.""We will defend this suit vigorously because it’s baseless,” a company spokesperson wrote in an email to Mashable. “We're very committed to an open internal culture, which means we frequently share with employees details of product launches and confidential business information. Transparency is a huge part of our culture.""The spokesperson continued, ""Our employee confidentiality requirements are designed to protect proprietary business information, while not preventing employees from disclosing information about terms and conditions of employment, or workplace concerns.""The ""John Doe"" who brought the suit is represented by the San Francisco employment law attorney Chris Baker, per court records. If found guilty of the 12 alleged violations of California's labor laws, Google could pay as much as $3.8 billion, with 75 percent of the penalty collected by the state and the rest distributed to Google's 65,000 employees, per The Verge. That would average to $14,600 per employee.",0.9254

So, Google’s search imbalance comes directly from the lack of ideological diversity in US media. Solution: Google could adjust it’s search engines to account for the heavy liberal overweighting.But, will Google do this? ..I doubt it.. Management at Google admit leaning strongly to the left, and have already demonstrated resistance, and a desire to algorithmically suppress conservative search.But what about conservative and libertarian demands for an unregulated and free market place?
