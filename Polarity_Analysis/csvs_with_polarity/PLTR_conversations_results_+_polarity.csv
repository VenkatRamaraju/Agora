190,"Motley Fool article on why Palantir is a buy:“I've been cautiously watching Palantir from the sidelines since its IPO, and I missed the big jump last year when shares went from sub-$10 to briefly over $40. Since then, the stock has been reduced to a much more modest valuation and the price is down some 40% from its peak. And after seeing the Q4 update -- the first for Palantir as a public company -- I'm ready to start (still very cautiously) dipping a toe in the water. My caution stems from the well-documented fact that the bulk of Palantir's business is derived from government contracts. There's also a lot of new stock being doled out as employee compensation that could throttle growth of a stake in the company. But Palantir expects its sales to grow an average of 30% a year through 2025 as data analytics demand picks up steam. Palantir has also made changes to speed up the rollout of its software for commercial companies, and it's posted some early successes on this front. Plus, Palantir is highly profitable (on an adjusted basis that backs out non-cash items like employee stock-based compensation, operating profit margin was 32% in Q4). The company also has loads of cash: $2.01 billion at the end of 2020, offset by debt of only $198 million. For a high-growth software technologist in a fast-growing industry, that kind of liquidity paired with a profitable operation is powerful. Granted, even after the recent taming of the stock price, Palantir trades for 32 times expected 2021 revenue (assuming the company grows sales by ""only"" 30%, although management said to expect ""30% or more"" growth). It's still a costly price tag, but not terribly unreasonable if the company does in fact deliver on its five-year plan. Thus, I'm ready to start nibbling a little here.“",0.9635

But why buy it if it will forever be in a hole. Are the expenses one timers or forever on the books? The institutions are 6 months ahead in their views so 6 months from now were still in the 20’s. The pop to 30 was irrational unfortunately. Or the love of the stock to the likes or kathi wood could just propel this company but that’s a paper tissue narrative. It’s a tough call. What it her motive for buying. Will earnings be positive in a year ? A billion with of deals won’t be signed.

So if you were waiting for a pull back in order to get in, today was that opportunity. Last thought, I would not fear the lock up expiration. If earnings are not as expected and we see lowest or high 20's after earnings do you think people will unload their shares when they see that it hit $45. Also I think Thiel and Karp have a ton of money to buy those shares on Fri the 19th if they beat earnings and get a pop to reward not only their employees but to drive out the shorts and reward us longs for our loyalty!! I want to wish you all good luck. In 25 years of investing and being in on some very good trades early in aapl, goog, Tesla. I can tell you PLTR is 100 stock in 18-24 months.

Distribute your money with diversification. You’re much better off investing about 25% of your portfolio in 3-4 ETFs (spread across 3-4 different sectors) + the remaining 75% into a variety of companies you believe in, preferably around 8-12, spread amongst multiple sectors of the economy.Gives you exposure to many different areas of growth but also minimizes, not eliminates, the odds of you waking up one day with half your money gone in the toilet.3. You only lose when you sell impatiently. Avoid emotional highs (where the market is doing great so you keep buying up everything) & emotional lows (omg it’s red= let me sell and cut my losses). 4.

Why don’t you disrupt your own industry? It’s broken. Why do you disrupt it with some of these new technologies? Why don’t you harness social media? Why don’t you invite people in—even your competitors—to brainstorm about these new ideas, to help spread the word?” And so I did that, and it’s been amazing.

If that is true they have probably been planning their dream house in the Denver area for a while now or perhaps buying a few acres in CO to build a second home or dream house.

Currently trading at a 45% discount from all time highs, you have the chance to get into a SaaS leader in a big time AI data space that isn't going to be regulated but is actually contractually partnered with allied governments. Logically speaking, in the future of business across all sectors, you either operate using AI or you get wiped out by competitors that do. So companies have the option of creating their own ai budget, hiring, training, implementing which takes TIME which is equal to dollars lost. Or, they install a software that is the leader and most advanced in the space they require to not only thrive but survive vs competition. The fact that people don't seem to understand base level logic is mind blowing. When multi billion dollar companies are up against it penny pinching as interest rates rise down the road and the economy becomes even more competitive, there's no longer two options there's only one. Take from this what you will but for those who understand business forget the numbers and media for a minute and just use you brain, simply, make a choice.",0.9867

People are reading tea leaves due to Facebook job postings and there have been MANY more large Enterprises that have Palantir experience in the job descriptions.I believe a relationship with Facebook is imminent. The threat for child exploitation, child trafficking, etc is real on FB and Palantir helps in this regard already with orgs specifically addressing this real threat in a growing virtual world.I also believe the relationship of Thiel with Facebook (Series A and Series C investor) helps the relationship come together. I expect THE SAME from the likes of Tesla (to take autonomous driving, robo taxis, etc) to the next level and continue to help Tesla outpace Chinese brands like Nio, Xpeng, etc. because after all, Palantir doesn’t get down with China.I also expect the same with SpaceX as flying people around will require extensive data analysis and predictive outcomes..I expect the same with PayPal as PayPal has gone heavy on Bitcoin and the managing/security of the dark web on Crypto will require policing and that’s right up the Palantir playbook. So sit tight my friends. But don’t get restless waiting for a Facebook announcement. Not all commercial contracts are public.

1329,"Forwarded as received from one Reddit memberAll of Palantir?s (weekly) blockbuster deals/contracts/partnership are being downplayed by financial media.Disclaimer: This isn?t DD nor is it financial advice. This post is for educational purposes only. My views are my own. Let?s talk about Japan, a notoriously a difficult market to enter for a slew of reasons. Successfully entering the Japanese market in any capacity is a big deal, especially for a western company. This has been completely buried by the financial media as we continue to see minimal positive coverage of Palantir. Once the Japanese market starts bearing fruit for Palantir the implications are huge. Rio Tinto, a mining giant recently signed a ?significant? multiyear agreement to license its Foundry analytics platform for mining. Again, the trend we?re seeing in the financial media is to downplay these big deals. Mining is extremely competitive, if one company adopts a tech that can save money or affect the bottom line others will have no choice but to line up. In a [press release](https://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-license-deal-mining-gian-rio-tinto-51611847014) Rio Tinto said that the deal ?is an important step in our digital transformation; enabling fast-paced, forward-looking decision making across our operations leading to improved results in safety, cost and production.?A giant, in the mining industry is using Palantir to digitally transform their business. The language is important. We?ve been hearing about digital transformation for years but all that?s meant for most is switching retail sales to online sales. Palantir is truly transforming the digital world. By taking data (which company?s usually have in droves and do almost nothing with) and turning it into a tool to increase productivity, efficiency and safety has major implications, not just for mining but for every company. Palantir seems to have found the new gold rush and they?re the only game in town. The latest partnership with IBM is yet another blockbuster announcement that?s been totally downplayed IBM is [fortune 50 company](https://fortune.com/fortune500/2020/search/), ranked 38th. For some perspective Disney is 49th and Facebook is 46th. But we?re not talking about IBMs achievements I?m getting at IBM?s gigantic customer base. IBM?s customer base include governments all around the world and even more impressively, the entire Fortune 500. As a partner Palantir now has a direct line to companies like Walmart, Amazon, Exxon, Apple etc etc. To say the implications here are massive may be an understatement. Just a quick factoid, Apple had to partner with IBM to fuel its enterprise growth, and their partnership did just that. What I believe is the most downplayed of all of this is the fact that Palantir is a downright monopoly. Right now we?re hearing that the market doesn?t know exactly what Palantir does or how to price it. This is typical #$%$ from Wall Street. Don?t these guys make billions of dollars from assimilating information like this before anyone else? If demo day showed us anything it?s that no company can currently do what Palantir does. In Theils own words Palantir is truly a 0 to 1 company, not a 1+. When I see Palantir through an objective lens and not Wall Street?s I can safely assume that Palantir, a monopoly, can achieve a 1 trillion dollar ($500 SP) market cap and above. With the explosive deals coming in weekly that would seem sooner rather than later. A couple of months ago I thought a 10 year timeline may have brought Palantir close to that number but I wasn?t factoring in some key statistics. The main one that I don?t exactly know how quickly a monopoly can grow. And that monopolies that were around back in the day didn?t have such a big market. I don?t think industries were as big as they are now with completely new sectors that have emerged since then. $1T MC was just an idea in the 80?s and 90?s. Now we have a handful of companies with trillion dollar market caps. Apple?s is 2.2 trillion while Microsoft is closing in on 2 trillion. With Palantir being a monopoly, inflation, and world trade opened to its fullest capacity I think Palantir achieving a $1 trillion market cap could be sooner than I initially thought.",0.9995

1388,"From 2012: SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Facebook Inc jumped nearly 13 percent on Wednesday, as investors breathed a sigh of relief that expiring trading restrictions on a huge block of shares failed to trigger an immediate wave of insider selling.“While the lockup is expiring, there is nothing requiring anybody to sell,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. “Given the low price, these long-term holders are deciding to hold the stock, and that is lifting it here as the fear of the expiration subsides.”Roughly 800 million Facebook shares were eligible for sale on Wednesday after restrictions on insider selling were lifted on the biggest block since Facebook’s May initial public offering.The lockup expiration greatly expands the 921-million-share “float” available for trading on the market until now.“We’ve seen this before with other lockups. People sell them leading up to the lockup period expiring, and then they have a bit of a relief rally,” said Ryan Jacob, chief executive of the Jacob Funds, which does not own Facebook shares.In August, shares of the online reviews website Yelp Inc surged by more than 20 percent on the day that insider trading restrictions expired.

It's not simply ""coincidence"" that there is a strong support level for this stock at 22.50, which is exactly 50% from the high of 45.00. This is where large institutions and fund managers will step in and either start or add to existing positions. Of course the price can go lower than 22.50, as seen on 3/5 when it went down to the low 20's, but the panic selling that day was bought up quickly. Follow the money.This is precisely why Ark and other companies kept adding shares around the $23 level (and lower) as it was getting closer to 22.50. Ask yourself, at what level do institutions wait to buy, 50% from the highs, 60%, 70%? They won't ""wait"" for 60% or 70%... Could PLTR go lower than $20, of course anything is possible, especially in this rate environment, but it's highly unlikely at this point. All of the angry posters on here saying the stock will go to $10 have zero experience.Bottom line, no doubt this will be a rocky road near term, but the market has already shown us the pressure points on this stock. Plus, the market has already shown how quickly the stock bounced from $20 on 3/5 low to $27 on 3/15, less than two weeks. So relax, use the dips to buy and you will be rewarded, not only long term, but within weeks. Leave emotion at the door and use logic.

People seem to forget that Tesla since it’s conception operated at a loss for many of the same reasons. Tesla just this year became profitable but it’s stock was always seen as an overvaluation by those who couldn’t see the long game. Palantir is long, no short term profits here.

(NASDAQ: PLTR) shares were advancing Thursday after the data analytics software company announced a strategic partnership.What Happened: Palantir said it has entered into a six-year strategic partnership with French automotive supplier Faurecia to help the latter accelerate its digital transformation and move toward carbon neutrality.The French company will use Palantir's Foundry software to obtain better insights on data from manufacturing to purchasing, and from engineering to finances.The software will help reduce Faurecia's material consumption, improve R&D competitiveness, secure purchasing excellence and track and measure overall CO2 neutrality efforts, according to Palantir.""The range of uses for Foundry across Faurecia shows the breadth of practical applications for our software in the manufacturing and automotive sectors,"" said Palantir COO Shyam Sankar.Why It's Important: Palantir's revenue guidance for fiscal year 2021 suggests a slowdown in growth to 30%-plus compared to 40% growth in the fourth quarter of 2021.The commercial segment's revenue growth slowed in the fourth quarter.Partnerships such as the one with Faurecia are likely to accelerate revenue momentum, eventually helping the company to outperform expectations.",0.9791

From initial design to production and assembly, through marketing and sales, and eventually in use on the road, this data can provide valuable insight into quality, safety, and performance.

With PLTR, since it was bearish by 20%, and I’m not saying that it’s 100% that it would go up, the chances for it to go further down is less than the short covering, the buy backs after the long weekend. The market is so counter intuitive. But my understanding tells me that these traders were ahead of smaller long term retail investors, so they sold way before the lock up, plus the pressure of not wanting to hold the shares over the long weekend as they have to pay interests, they over sold the stock.

So you have oversold conditions at a longer term moving average and a candle showing bearish sentiment is slowing down and being overcome by bullish sentiment. No promises, I'm not a financial advisor, make your own decisions, but IMHO I think it is more likely the share price has a several dollar increase on Monday than a decrease.

Finally, AWS offers ANALYTICS services as well7. Since Palantir deals with data analytics, it makes sense to team up with AWS to use the many AWS services and help generate REVENUE using the millions of companies who are also using AWS services 8. Imagine if Palantir SERVICE is sold as another ""standard service"" by the existing AWS service framework.9. Maybe some of the Palantir services require massive computers and databases and storage.

To me, everything he says resonates deeply and I would follow the guy off a cliff. Of course there are obvious drawbacks - if not constantly fact-checked, these guys end up chasing chemtrails and blaming the govt for 9/11, and the only way to really tell the difference is to look at their history - are they delivering on their grand visions? Well, with PLTR, the answer is a resounding ""yes"", they are frigging changing the world to the better already (finding Bin Laden??). The only thing you can know is that what happened ten years ago, Karp figured out 20 years ago.

Today I took profits on some puts and repositioned myself with new calls and puts at even better strikes and expiries. I haven't bought any new shares today, but I might do so soon. I currently own 2,000 shares, and I'd like to double or triple that amount this year.

3462,"My fellow Palantir comrades,Hold on to your PLTR stock because:1. PLTR has virtually no competition2. PLTR worked on its software for 17 years3. Think of 17 years = Gathering specific requirements from the government, DESIGN, CODING, TESTING, DOCUMENTATION, etc...4. Any competitor has to deal with a LOT of time to try to catch up with PLTR5. Google is SCARED of the fact that team (AWS + IBM + Palantir) are now working together to Bring down the Google house of cards (DATA is what Google collects from all of us)6. There is a possibility that Amazon or IBM may ACQUIRE Palantir for 100's of BILLIONS of dollars7. Many people don't know what Palantir software does. Here are some examples:...a. Many businesses have millions of customers' DATA located in many files, databases, and profiles. ...b. Palantir will gather this historic data, analyze it, and actually tell your sales team that this customer will be ready to buy a $25K car because his/her current car is old and historically this person NEVER spends more than 30K to buy any car....c. Palantir will tell your sales team that this person prefers to fly United Airlines and goes to a Beach vacation during the month of July. So, your sales team will be presented with a nice offer to fly to Virginia Beach, with United Airline, Hotel, and free museum tickets to Virginia Beach any week during this coming July....d. Obviously, Palantir works with the government/military and many of the services that Palantir offers to the government/military are NOT available to the public... BUT, Palantir can leverage that experience to create Commercial software because of these government/military contracts8. Now you know why Google who COLLECTS and ANALYZES data from your email, search, Google Drive, etc... is SCARED of team (Palantir + IBM + AWS)9. Fair enough?Peace!",0.9855

I did not buy Palantir to get fixated on a few days of trading, particularly on something that we have expected since October. I bought Palantir because of its products, management, future growth and that it has a monopoly. Peter Thiel and Founders fund own nearly 14%.

These same ""Cheer Leaders"" said the same thing when PLTR traded at $30, $35, $40, and $45... Then: BOOM, the price is back to reality and trading at $23 to $25 AGAIN5. Conclusion: If you bought at $23, SELL when it goes to $27 and buy again when it goes back to reality around $23 to $256. Today's stock market is not setup for LONG TERM anymore...7.

No. Will it be the correct move much more often than not? Absolutely.These big hedge funds can manipulate prices any given second, a little PR here & there, and boom: price is manipulated. They count on your weak hands to get in where they see fit.If doing well in the stock market was as simple as: buy the stock that’s been green for 3 months, everybody would be rich. If you believe in this position and/or others: STAY PATIENT. It’s been proven time and time again: the turtles win this race more often than not.I saw the same panic in PLTR when it was climbing from the 10s to 20s.

4249,"Palantir Gotham is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the United States Intelligence Community and United States Department of Defense, fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, and cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor (responsible for the GhostNet and the Shadow Network investigation).Other clients as of 2013 included DHS, NSA, FBI, CDC, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Special Operations Command, West Point, the Joint IED Defeat Organization and Allies. However, at the time the United States Army continued to use its own data analysis tool.[36] Also, according to TechCrunch, ""The U.S. spy agencies also employed Palantir to connect databases across departments. Before this, most of the databases used by the CIA and FBI were siloed, forcing users to search each database individually. Now everything is linked together using Palantir.""[36]U.S. military intelligence used the Palantir product to improve their ability to predict locations of improvised explosive devices in its war in Afghanistan. A small number of practitioners reported it to be more useful than the United States Army's program of record, the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS-A). California Congressman Duncan D. Hunter complained of United States Department of Defense obstacles to its wider use in 2012.[68]Palantir has also been reported to be working with various U.S. police departments, for example accepting a contract in 2013 to help the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center build a controversial license plates database for California.[69] In 2012 New Orleans Police Department partnered with Palantir to create a predictive policing program.[70]In 2014, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) awarded Palantir a $41 million contract to build and maintain a new intelligence system called Investigative Case Management (ICM) to track personal and criminal records of legal and illegal immigrants. This application has originally been conceived by ICE's office of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), allowing its users access to intelligence platforms maintained by other federal and private law enforcement entities. The system reached its ""final operation capacity"" under the Trump administration in September 2017.[71]Palantir took over the Pentagon's Project Maven contract in 2019 after Google decided not to continue developing AI unmanned drones used for bombings and intelligence.[72]International Atomic Energy Agency EditPalantir was used by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify if Iran is in compliance with the 2015 agreement.[40]",0.9959

4273,"How much do investors really want to keep punishing this stock? Corporate insiders sell shares all the time. Over at Facebook, COO Sheryl Sandberg sells shares pretty much every month like clockwork. It's not as though the insiders at PLTR have sold off all of their shares: they sold a portion and kept a portion. And I'm sure they have share options as part of their compensation package and will be obtaining and selling more shares in the weeks, months, and years to come. But again: How much do we really want to keep punishing this stock? Do investors really believe that this is a $10 or $20 stock? If so, it never should have gone to $45, as it did in January, and it never should have run for 16 straight trading days from late January to mid February with closing prices above $30. Yesterday, for two minutes, investors thought PLTR was a $30 stock. Today, for 15 minutes, investors thought it was a $20 stock. Obviously, it can't be both, and it's unlikely to be either. PLTR is going to become a $50 stock, then an $80 stock, and then a $100 stock. Then, over time, it will become a $200 stock, a $300 stock, and so on. Basically, all it will take to become a solidly $50 stock is news of one or two new major clients, such as an Apple or a Facebook or a foreign government, and a Q1 earnings report that reflects net-positive earnings per share. All the signs are there that from now to the next earnings report, such developments are likely to materialize. By May, if not before, we should see PLTR trading solidly in the $40s and heading into the $50s.",0.9903

That steal won't be recognized for some time it seems. The earnings report was strong but this stock based compensation negative and the subsequent sales that are being promoted by Yahoo like a feature film while contracts with 3M and others are hardly a blip is putting pressure on the stock. Lastly - I'm of the belief that this is where the stock market saying of money moving from the inpatient to the patient is reality. While our options traders and short term swing traders get burnt and move on, the institutions use that as an opportunity to grab shares without having to move the needle. We may have weeks more of this BS but I do believe that over the next 2-3 earnings calls we'll finally reverse this back to the upside and for the long haul. Gluck everyone!",0.9913

With software companies, they recognize a portion of the revenue during the quarter the contract is signed and the rest as incurred.

4812,"How does a company continually make no profits and proceed to stay in business? It seems counterintuitive at best. However, companies can become successful even without turning profits for extended periods of time – and can even simultaneously continue to attract investors.There are three basic ways big companies survive without profits.Purposeful Reinvestment – Earnings are significant and large, but the company chooses to put most of its revenues back into the business to keep propelling growth. Amazon is the king of purposeful reinvestment, infrequently reporting a profit in its more than twenty years of existence and following an overt strategy focused on continued growth over profits. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has the revenue and base to allow profits, but it argues that without constant investment in its business, the company would be overtaken by competitors in different fields.Hopeful Expansion – Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) is a good example of this category. With recent acquisitions such as Vine, Periscope and MoPub, Twitter is trying to carve out a larger social media presence but is dealing with considerable expenses, including almost 45 percent of revenue paid out in compensation as stock options. As opposed to Amazon, the intent is to reach and sustain profitability.Initial Growth – The company shows incredible growth and promise in its early stages and secures venture capital...",0.9975

(NYSE:PLTR) today announced a multi-million dollar expansion of its relationship with 3M. 3M has chosen to expand its use of Palantir's Foundry platform to support its digital transformation, assisting in the build out of a dynamic supply chain that enables the global manufacturer to respond nimbly to changes in demand across tens of thousands of products.“In an increasingly complex world, the success of our business depends on our ability to respond quickly to changing facts on the ground,” said Brig Knott, 3M’s Vice President, End to End Service, Operations & Lean Six Sigma. “In the midst of a global pandemic and significant changes to our demand across products, the Foundry platform enabled us to react quickly and effectively. We’re excited to expand this work across the 3M enterprise.”“3M has been at the forefront of digital transformation, and we’re excited to deepen our relationship with this innovative and global company,” said Alex Karp, co-founder and CEO of Palantir.This expanded relationship builds on the work Palantir already supports across 3M’s efforts in supply chain alerting, demand forecasting and business planning. “Palantir has played an important role for our Enterprise Operations digital migration strategy; we’re eager to keep pushing the boundaries to ensure a continued focus on our customers,” noted Shaun Braun, 3M’s VP of Digital Transformation.",0.9905

The fact that this is holding up at this price despite what's happening in the market at the exact same time of the lockup expiration is not only a miracle but a show of strength. You have funds ADDING regularly while the many of you complain of stagnation. For starters, this is up 150% since DPO only 5 months ago. The earnings report was a thing of BEAUTY outside of the stock based compensation (which means very little in it's infancy as a public company). The insider sales have happened at EVERY SINGLE company regardless of vertical. Facebook, Google, Appl, AMZN take your pick people. The village nit wits that want you to believe this is some malpractice by PLTR leadership are a joke and only attempting to scare you.This is primed and pumped to be a CASH COW...The upside to this pandemic has been many more people are at home and investing out of boredom. No boss or anyone else to look over your shoulder while you frequent message boards or your holdings account. That downside is every Tom, Dianna and Harry wants to be a day trader, looking for immediate returns. Invest in this long term and be graced with profits that you've only previously dreamt about. How many times has someone said ""wish I bought TSLA"", ""wish i bought Appl"" ""wish I bought Msft"" etc etc. This is your opportunity to buy a future MEGA cap company. Enjoy the price stagnation by loading up. I was able to increase my position by 4x since my initial entry at $10...I continue to buy because I've done my RESEARCH...It's a beautiful thing to educate yourself and have a vision for the direction of our planet..If you can do both you sleep like a baby owning this stock...If rely on others, you're subject to manipulation from the best of them.#notallthatisgoldglitters - Yes thats PLTR password for the demo, same PLTR that issued 30%+ growth guidance through 2025 but certainly feel free to disregard and listen to a message board bear on why this is worth $10.",0.9987

You don’t realize how this opens up an entirely new addressable market that was not even included in the investor day presentation.Palantir made a shift from having companies need to buy Gotham or Foundry in full. To deciding to offer Foundry up in modular form. Meaning they give organizations who didn’t have the budget, approval or foresight to its full capabilities org wide. The option to bite off components of Foundry and in smaller deployments.That modularity was a genius move as many medium/large business may not be able to justify massive enterprise wide deployment. However, by letting these companies dabble with aspects of Foundry they know it will lead to more wide spread adoption across other functions of those business and allow organic growth of Foundry within those accounts.Now bring in AWS partnership and you have your Trojan horse into those many medium/large businesses that were not a part of your TAM as the TAM was entirely Enterprise customer focused. Which is where the small PLTR sales team and IBM reps will pitch PLTR.AWS enterprise agreements require customers to spend x amount of money per year but that money can be spent across their platform products as well (which now includes Foundry)That’s right if you have an AWS Enterprise Agreement you are obligated to maintain a certain amount of spend across their platform products in order to maintain your EA and it’s negotiated discounts.Customers will literally be using Foundry, making palantir money simply out of necessity which will lead to further adoptionLastly - My tech sales counterparts who work for Amazon (AWS) are incentivized handsomely for selling adoption into partner solutions.

You don’t realize how this opens up an entirely new addressable market that was not even included in the investor day presentation.Palantir made a shift from having companies need to buy Gotham or Foundry in full. To deciding to offer Foundry up in modular form. Meaning they give organizations who didn’t have the budget, approval or foresight to its full capabilities org wide. The option to bite off components of Foundry and in smaller deployments.That modularity was a genius move as many medium/large business may not be able to justify massive enterprise wide deployment. However, by letting these companies dabble with aspects of Foundry they know it will lead to more wide spread adoption across other functions of those business and allow organic growth of Foundry within those accounts.Now bring in AWS partnership and you have your Trojan horse into those many medium/large businesses that were not a part of your TAM as the TAM was entirely Enterprise customer focused.

It is often difficult to take in all that is said during a live ""Earnings"" call, but in the quiet of your own time, you can spend the time digesting and understanding what was communicated. Not only have I taken the time to read the transcript, but I have also complete follow-up research on key points I want to understand better. For example, there is so much chatter about the US government being a single point of failure because so much of Palantir's business is with them. For this reason, they must diversify their customer base to grow and thrive. Although this would most certainly be beneficial, it belays the fact that the US government alone spends 4.4Trillion per year - 12% for Defense, 23% for Healthcare, and 25% other (as an example). Palantir only did 610Million in business with the US government (in 2020) because in the prior models they focused on the IT sector within the government. However, with the investments in the end-to-end workflows (Apollo and Foundry), they can now focus on nearly 250Billion worth of business with the US government. The deal with IBM was made possible because the investments made to improve the cradle to grave process (or as they say mud to space) delivered 84% gross margin - do you know what that means? They can now bring on channel partners because there is enough compensation there for everyone to be paid accordingly. Furthermore, this means that they can now extend this offering to other channel partners. Another note-worthy nugget was the fact that they already have 2.8B in the sales pipeline with an average contract duration of 3.8years. Do you understand what that means - customer stickiness! And the final point I will draw attention to was their projection for sales of 30% compounded annually for the next 5years (2025). A question was asked by one of the shareholders - can Palantir sustain such growth? Shyam’s response was thorough and he ended with this line....""And these are examples of why we're confident in our long-term growth of being greater than 4 billion in 2025"". For these and many more reasons I will be a long-term holder of this stock.",0.9978

5678,"So many overreactions from “longs” and trolls during every green or red day .It’s always either:1.PLTR is going to the moon by next weekOr2.PLTR is trash and is a bag holder’s worst nightmare.The reality: a little red day/week/month or Green Day/week/month is irrelevant in 2-5 years of growth.- PLTR is not a 10 bagger overnight (at least by the odds), it’s a 10+ bagger over the next 2-5 years.Check the comments, been consistently preaching this since DPO and I’ve done very well with it since buying at $9.45.This company cannot be evaluated based upon the traditional “fundamentals” like current profits etc. It is something unique and quite frankly, has tons of room for growth on the commercial side of things, excluding big brother who isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.“Fundamentals” sound great, doesn’t always apply as you have to adjust to the current market where anything goes and tech is overvalued as a whole, not a PLTR issue.-Citron did their damage, others have downgraded this company as well, and the lock up period is over. This stock is a few catalysts away from serious gains to the $40s and possibly $50 if it’s substantial enough.Either way, patience is key. The stock market rewards the guy who’s willing to wait it out > the guy who panics on every red day, 9/10 times.",0.9593

5684,"Zoom out to 6m chart, and look at the insane volume of shares that were traded during lockup. Consider the fact that it actually made it to the other side without dropping below 25. (Miracle? Mithril?) Now play with the idea that long institutions and insiders now own close to a majority of the shares and they won't sell anytime soon - what volume is then required to make this move quite drastically upwards? My bet is that it won't take much, as the actively traded shares are actually not that many, less than 600 million, which is basically pre-lockup levels. With a loooong list of catalysts ahead, probably including but not limited to, Apple, Facebook, this is perfectly positioned to have FOMO applied to a limited number of shares. Perfect storm conditions, but we'll have to ride out this current situation first.",0.9808
