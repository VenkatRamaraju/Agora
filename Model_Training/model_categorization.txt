NOTES:
    - Fundamental Analysis: using data from publicly available sources (balance sheets, cash flow, income statements) to perform analysis.
    - Financial Ratios to look at in the short-term:
        - Liquidity: current assets / current liabilities
            - good financial health: liquidity ratio > 1
        - ROE: net income / total common equity
            - good financial health: ROE ratio is 20%
        - ROIC: (EBIT - Tax Provision) / total invested capital
            - Good ROIC: greater than 2%
        - Price Earnings to Growth (PEG) ratio: [Forward (P/E)] / expected earnings growth rate
            - ticker.info[pegRatio]
            - pegRatio > 1 --> overvalued; pegRatio < 1 --> undervalued or fairly priced

    - we should go by quarterly reports for most short-term data
    - not all data is readily available from Yahoo Finance API; we'll have to code some of these formulas, but they're just ratios so not too bad
    - KNN Model can have the following:
        - polarities
        - liquidity ratio
        - ROE
        - ROIC
        - PEG Ratio
    - We just have to figure out how to take those properties and classify them

    - Short ratio: the number of shares of a stock that are currently shorted over the stock's average daily trading volume
        - tells investors how many days it would take short sellers to cover their positions if the price of a given stock were to increase
        - if short ratio is increasing, then investor sentiment maybe becoming negative
        - if it's decreasing, then stock price might be increasing
