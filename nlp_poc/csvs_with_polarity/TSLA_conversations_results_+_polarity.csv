Is tsla profitable without those credits? Competition & free markets... allow for choices.

14,"This stock will start coming down if the SEC bans short selling on this stock (Not that they are allowed to do). One single tweet from Musk where he said, he had an offer to go private to $420 when the stock was at $280 which had created a short squeeze and saved the company from bankcrupcy. I would say, Musk is an evil genius who took a calculated risk by tweeting fake news that caught shorts off guard and the squeeze is automated since then.

25,"I have extended my short exposure MASSIVLY.The bubble actually stops and we will see abutting never seen at WALLSTREET.Tesla to Produce 800 million cars?PE is often used as a realistic barometer of a companies value. With an auto producer that PE could be extended to cars produced. For example, Toyota produced 8.8 million cars last year to achieve earnings. Their PE is 9.21. This indicates that Toyota needs to produce 8.8 million cars times 9.21 years of earnings to meet market cap. This total is 81,480,000 vehicles.Tesla produced 500,000 cars last year. Their PE is 1,628 and this is not a fully diluted PE. Multiply the two and the total is 814 million cars. Fully diluted and this number nears 900 million. There is not enough raw material capacity to achieve this in the next 10 years. World auto production in 2019 was 91,786,861. Tesla, at their present margin ratios which would include the sale of regulatory credits, would need to sell every car in the world for 10 years to have a PE similar to Toyota. The Tesla market cap is absurd at best. Buy it now and you will pay a hefty price in the next few years.",0.9543

80,"Mi OWN theory of how could be the Tesla Fair value today. This is my POV.This is IMHO. Volkswagen sold in 2020 9,3 million cars. 220k of wich were EV vehicles. So, 220k is the 2,3% of the total sales of Volkswagen. The electric part of Volkswagen would be valued in the market in 2000 million. (87.000 M of market cap X 2,3% = 2000 million). About 9100 euros per electric car sold. Let´s supose Tesla could sell 750k cars in 2021. 750k x 9100 euros = 7.000 million. In 7000 million 2020 PE Ratio would be PE Ratio 9,722 way similar to VW Group PE Ratio. Now let´s apply an hype PE Ratio like Amazon or Apple, for example, a 100X PE ratio.Hyped the fair value could be 75.000 million with 750k cars sold in 2021. IMHOThis is only my POV",0.556

The stock is ""driven by growth afforded by valuation,"" said Murphy, who has tried to estimate what the current stock price affords to Tesla in terms of incremental plants and units and what those incremental units translate into in incremental revenue and profits. Building automotive industry capacity is expensive and often generates low returns, but ""the higher the upward spiral of Tesla's stock goes, the cheaper capital becomes to fund growth, which is then rewarded by investors with a higher stock price,"" argues Murphy.",0.9531

139,"Even with Tesla’s stratospheric valuation (as Wien hints at) built on stratospheric expectations for the future of electric and autonomous cars, the Wall Street bulls on Tesla remain well-entrenched.“Overall we are seeing a major inflection of EV demand globally with our expectations that EV vehicles ramp from ~3% of total auto sales today to 10% by 2025. We believe this demand dynamic will disproportionately benefit the clear EV category leader Tesla over the next few years especially in the key China region which we believe could represent ~40% of its EV deliveries by 2022 given the current brisk pace of sales with 150k+ deliveries in its first year out of the gates with Giga 3,” says Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives.Ives has a bull case price target of $1,000 on Tesla’s stock, or 25% above current levels.Meanwhile, the stock’s melt-up has begun to attract a legion of Tesla doubters into the bull camp. The stock has caught several upgrades this year, only serving to fuel the speculative fervor.Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy recently marked up his price target on Tesla’s stock by $400 to $800. He says the upgrade reflects a company that has proven adept at raising capital, boosting margins and managing investor expectations.Over at RBC Capital Markets, long-time Tesla bear Joseph Spak conceded this month he has been “completely wrong” on the stock.

On the 18th at 5.15 pm we also learn which stock will be taken out of index... with Tesla market cap i read that every 10 dollar swing in tesla will sway entire S and P by one point ! I m a bit confused on how the s and p funds will have to ""re balance"" and what that will do to TSLA if tesla equal 1.6 percent market cap of s and p then will those funds have to have 1.6 % of tesla in their fund that means lots of buying of tesla / or they will trim all their positions in their fund so they have to buy less amount of tesla but tesla will still be 1.6 % of their fund .... is that correct ? either way the demand for TSLA will be huge and i guess the 5 billion offering will be served up that day to help prevent huge volatility. But the offering is only 1 percent of float so it still seems to me that the DEMAND will outstrip supply and if that is the case TSLA should run ! It seems too obvious thats why i dont like it. Seen too many times stocks run on anticipation of news and then when drug or rocket launch or news stock sells off. But in this case its not going to be people's emotions, its large funds mandated to buy the stock ! Again seems to obvious.... what am i missing ? so not sure why everyone is not thinking for at least until dec 21 this thing will set new high above 700 ?now after the 21 st i think this will gradually fall back to 500 as it is way overbought, overvalued, and has come too fast too quickly. anyhow now me and my 100 shares are along for the ride > would welcome and be thankful for what and why TSLA will do on Dec 21 and the days leading up thanks in advance B3",0.9962

Stock prices are signaling that the economy is better than ever with businesses flourishing, and any idiot can look around and see that's true!2) With Janet Yellen coming in, it is 100% guaranteed the government will not let the stock market fall.3) Millenials buying houses means there will be plenty of cash left over to buy $50,000 and up electric cars...especially since their wages are rising rapidly and prices for other things like food, health care and education are getting cheaper by the day.4) There is tremendous pent up demand for autonomous robotaxis. Billions of people are just itching to hop into self driving Tesla taxis. We should see millions of Tesla robotaxis on the road real, real soon!5) Tesla owners will get discounted tickets on Hyperloop and the Mars shuttle rockets.6) Even though the stock is up sevenfold from only a year ago it is still cheap.7) The profits from Tesla's tequila and flamethrower business alone justifies $100 billion of its market cap. Just imagine what will happen if Musk expands the line of Tesla beverages to include Vodka and hard seltzers!8) Rumored Apple buyout in the works and they'll need to offer AT LEAST $1,000 a share. Which would make perfect sense because there is absolutely nothing better Apple can do with a trillion dollars in capital than buy Tesla. Think about it!9) Elon Musk said that the new roadster will have rocket thrusters as an option (Google it!) and the car should be available real, real soon.10) The Tesla semi will be available real, real soon.11) The Cybertruck will be available real, real soon.12) Elon Musk just announced a $25,000 car. It'll be available real, real soon.13) Tesla cars have the highest quality ratings of all cars. Just check Consumer Reports.14) Elon Musk's innovative idea of building cars in a tent saves tremendous overhead.15) Tesla's financials are the cleanest and most transparent of any publicly held company...even putting Berkshire Hathaway to shame!16) Elon Musk has never been in trouble with the SEC. He has a gold-plated reputation.17) Elon Musk doesn't engage in nepotism...such as putting close relatives on the board, or bailing out a close relative's failing Solar business at the expense of shareholders' equity.18) Tesla executives are the most loyal in the industry. Turnover rate for executives is near zero.19) Elon Musk never engages in childish or questionable behavior such as making snarky comments on Twitter.20) Elon Musk is too busy running the massively profitable business to worry about the criticisms made by short sellers.21) More people staying home and working remotely means gas prices will skyrocket, making $50,000 and up electric cars look like a bargain.22) And last but not least, Tesla shareholders are among the most astute investors in all stock market history. Not only are they brilliant, but also they would never dream of engaging in speculative activities like buying call options or pyramiding stock buys on margin.",0.9985

546,"Why was TSLA's guidance so vague? 50% sales growth over the next several years. So, whatever 2021 sales growth is, it can be consistent with 50% over the next several years, because there is no specific promise on 2021 sales.I am expecting 2021 sales to be up much more than 50% as TSLA's competitors are still ramping up capacity, especially in the US. It won't be until the end of 2022 there most of the competitors will be effective in the US. So, sales are likely to be good for TSLA.But the stock is so overpriced, there is a big risk of a sharp drop in stock price. The class action suit lawyers would jump in and argue that any false forecast warrants compensation to those to bought TSLA at high prices. These suits are usually without merit in my opinion, but they almost always get settled with substantial cost to corporation.So, TSLA's legal team has probably schooled management ""DON""T MAKE ANY PREDICTIONS"".Musk doesn't like following the advice and has tended to make predictions which don't come true. But, with the stock price so overpriced now, the downside risk is just too high.Just my speculation as I have no inside sources.",0.9569

What happened next?Banks continued to outperform the market for the next decade.If you invested in banks at or near the low, you made a fortune.Since March of 2020, the stock market has irrationally declared oil companies as dead. They point to the lack of demand due to COVID.The COVID demand issue removed 5 million barrels per day of demand from the market. The oil market demand is currently 96 million barrels per day. This is a demand reduction of less than 5% during the worst pandemic in a century.As as they declared banks as dead in 2009, pop culture says that COVID has made oil dead. Just as in 2009, they’re wrong.Oil inventories in the US and China continue to drop. COVID cases are dropping precipitously. Vaccines are being distributed. Demand is back.Meanwhile, world leaders are making oil drilling nearly impossible due to environmental concerns. This means supply is limited in a rising demand scenario.The result according to Goldman Sachs, is the beginning of a new secular bull market in oil. For the next 12-15 years, oil will be priced at over $100 a barrel.This means huge profits for the oil companies. These profits will be used to buy out wind & solar competitors as the world transitions to green.If you lost big in $GME or $AMC, or you gained big in $TSLA, now is the time to invest in oil companies.

The CEO states that currently there is a barrier of entry in building new cap seize ships, because in a few years the propulsion of these vessels will change (probably hydrogen -- my take). Which is very good for ship currently, less short term competition2. The company that installed the scrubber technology will get paid per agreement on the fuel savings that the vessels make. (put another way, no fuel savings = no payment) and the scrubbers will be owned by ship in a few years.

So, as you know those sellers will have to wait 30 days if they want to repurchase shares or it becomes a 'wash sale' therefore I believe share price could remain depressed at least until the last week of January Now an interesting variable in this thesis is that the more shares sold for those reasons the more shares they are likely to be repurchasing in other words the lower the drop the higher the pop, starting the last week of January. Which btw, if Tesla remains true to form Q4 and full year earnings will be announced the last Wednesday of the month on January 27th.

If you’ve made profits take some off the table and listen to Goldman Sachs!Okay, I know the popular line is oil is dead...but is it really realistic to say a product with 95 million barrels per day in global demand (and quickly rising back to 100 mm Barrels per day) is dead?Secondly, the oil companies have developed a huge business and engineering infrastructure that will help them in the transition to green energy over the couple of decades.The investment thesis is as follows:Intro- Oil production is lower than global demand as evidenced by the lower trend of US & Chinese oil stocks. Going forward oil supply will be constrained by government policies to encourage investment in green energy, however, due to global reliance on fossil fuels, oil demand is not projected to fall until 2055 - it will continue to grow at around 2% per year. Thesis-The combination of decreased production and rising demand create the catalyst for the final long term secular bull market in the oil and gas industry with prices between $100-$150 starting in 2023. Details-Diversify your recent gains into the oil & Nat gas sector while the market is undervalued. The Green energy transition is limiting oil supply through government policy. Demand is rising as Covid cases are dropping and vaccines are rolled out. See the US inventory report released every Wednesday and the China inventory report.Secondly refer to the recent Goldman Sachs report about the start of the secular bull market in oil. Expect $100-$150 oil beginning in 2023 through 2040.The cash flow generated by these prices will drive further innovation in green energy from oil companies and further result in the strategic buyout of wind and solar companies by the existing oil industry.An example of this trend is $OXY. They have developed the worlds first carbon neutral crude and the world’s most advanced carbon capture and sequestration technology. Warren Buffett owns OXY preferred. Today you can buy excellent companies or ETFs with high distributors at 1/2 price.$GEL for $6.00; $ET for $6.00; $OXY for $21 or $XLE for $41.Take some profits and invest in oil companies.

How is any EV car is going to make money selling a car with a battery can compete with a Tesla driving like a sport car for $25000? And we only talk about car. What will other companies do when they make batteries? How far can the batteries go? How low can the cost go? What keep Tesla from selling their low cost superior batteries to the market?

The S&P inclusion, has given the perfect crescendo to this run-up as retail investors believe that these funds need to keep buying and buying and buying until 12/21, but it is just as likely these institutions are pumping these gains (more likely some combination of the two). What if these whales start dumping before 12/18 with their massive YTD gains... It feels so risky and so speculative to try and guess the top of this, and get out before it drops...

1283,"Here’s what you need to do with your profits from $AMC and $GME. The market has taken on the false narrative that a virus caused the entire world’s infrastructure to change overnight to all solar and wind. This is simply a false narrative. There’s no doubt that the industrialized world will transition to green energy, but this will take a coordinated effort for the next 15 years.What do we do in the meantime? We change government policies to discourage oil and gas production. Part of this is to limit supply to drive up the price of gasoline and diesel fuel. This makes green alternative energy more tenable because it is cheap relative to oil and gas.In the US, the easy policies of the old administration actually hurt the oil and gas industry. They drilled and drilled until the US became the world leading exporter of oil and gas. Then COVID happened and world wide demand dropped by 8% - that’s right only 8%.So far in 2021, demand has recovered by 5%. As of right now, we are only using 3% less oil and gas than we were. Does that sound like a dead industry? Absolutely not.The meteoric stock price rise of solar companies and $TSLA is a bubble. The profits are not there.Now with oil at $53 and Nat Gas at $2.85 - oil companies are profitable.With oil and gas supply being limited by policy - we can expect oil to be $75 by 2022 and over $100 by 2023 - 2035. This is the last golden age of black gold. The last bull market of oil before the oil majors buyout the green energy companies with the treasure troves of cash they are going to generate over the next 15 years.So...take your profits and buy $OXY $XLE $XOM $CVX $ET & $GEL.

1430,"Why Tesla is going to $1,000 a share before the end of the year.1) With stocks at all-time historical highs, there is nowhere to go but up. Stock prices are signaling that the economy is better than ever, and any idiot can see that is true!2) With Janet Yellen coming in, it is 100% guaranteed the government will not let the stock market fall.3) Millenials buying houses means there will be plenty of cash left over to buy electric cars...especially since their wages are rising rapidly and prices for other things like food, health care and education are getting cheaper by the day.4) There is tremendous pent up demand for autonomous robotaxis. Billions of people are waiting to hop into self driving taxis. We should see millions of robotaxis on the road in a few months...tops!5) Tesla owners will get discounted tickets on Hyperloop and the Mars shuttle rockets.6) Even though the stock is up sevenfold from only a year ago it is still cheap.7) The profits from Tesla's tequila and flamethrower business alone justifies $100 billion in market cap.8) Rumored Apple buyout in the works and they'll need to offer AT LEAST $1,000 a share. Which would make perfect sense because there is absolutely nothing better Apple can do with a trillion dollars in capital than buy Tesla. Think about it!9) Elon Musk said that the new roadster would have rocket thrusters as an option (Google it!) and the car would be available real, real soon.10) The Tesla semi will be available real, real soon.11) The Cybertruck will be available real, real soon.12) Elon Musk just announced a $25,000 car. It'll be available real, real soon.13) Tesla cars have the highest quality ratings of all cars. Just check Consumer Reports.14) Elon Musks innovative idea of building cars in a tent saves tremendous overhead.15) Tesla's financial's are the cleanest and most transparent of any publicly held company...even putting Berkshire Hathaway to shame!16) Elon Musk has never been in trouble with the SEC. He has a gold-plated reputation.17) Elon Musk doesn't engage in nepotism..such as pitting close relatives on the board\ or bailing out a close relative's failing Solar business the expense of shareholders equity.18) Tesla executives are the most loyal in the industry. Turnover rate for executives is near zero.19) And last but not least, Tesla shareholders are among the most astute investors in all stock market history. Not only are they brilliant, but they would never dream of engaging in speculative activities like buying call options or pyramiding stock buys on margin.",0.998

1475,"ChargePoint ($SBE), the world’s largest EV Charging Stations Network and Equipment Provider with 70%+ EV Charging market share is going public via SPAC merge with $SBE shell, vote to go public on 2/11 next Thurs. If you are a shareholder, be sure to vote like I had already. Unlike most SPACs that do NOT generate any revenue or remain in concept or prototype stages, ChargePoint ($SBE) already generates $130 million dollars revenue annually as of now. Per my researching of the management presentation, ChargePoint’s revenue model include the following areas:(#1.) L2 Charging Stations, also known as ""regular charging"" requires relatively long charging time but was Recommended by the EV charging industry as prefer charging method for the benefit of the battery, because the available Fast-charging technology in the world currently would reduce lithium-ion battery (most expensive part of the EV)'s lifespan, if fast charging too frequently. Therefore, L2 charging stations (regular charging) were recommended for daily commuters; while fast charging stations were recommended for Long-distance drivers and big road trips. For further details please refer to ChargePoint management presentation on their website with regards to the cons of pros of regular charging vs. fast-charging and its impact to battery life.(#2.) Fast Charging Stations, ChargePoint also owns large number of Fast Charging stations recommended for road trips and long distance drivers only. In fact, ChargePoint has more fast-charging stations than most of its competitors that focus solely on Fast Charging stations. The Fast Charging method is not recommended for routine commuters (majority of the EV uses) due to its toll on the lithiumion battery lifespans. Please further research on the cons and pros of fast-charging and impact to battery life.(#3.) At-Home EV Charging equipment, ChargePoint dominates the ""AT-HOME"" market with products At-home hook up/wiring/converter that would allow 10X the charge speed and efficiency comparing to regular at home electric outlets(#4.) Software data application as a services, also known as SaaS recurring revenue, including subscription apps developed for station searching via phones and GPS, Charging efficiency management, battery analysis, etc.I personally expect once the ticker symbol changing from $SBE to ""$CHPT"" ChargePoint next week, we should see increasing and more consistent media and institutional investors coverage and attention, because ChargePoint is simply the largest, the most widely used and the most crucial part of the EV revolution and EV Econ-system (basically ChargePoint dominates the infrastructure of all EVs, similar to the way gas stations + oil refineries roles to the internal combustion engine vehicles). The #2 EV Charging provider in line is Tesla EV with over 10% of the market, and the rest $CLII $TPGY $DCFC $BLNK and others together competing over the remaining 20%. I personally would expect the massive Price Appreciation wou to continue for ChargePoint during the merge week (next week) and after merge (unlike a lot of other spacs that dropped in price after merge, because those SPACs Do Not have Any Revenue only concept prototype, but ChargePoint is the industry leader and had $130 Million dollars in revenue already).

A short squeeze can occur when there is a lack of supply and an excess of demand for the stock due to short sellers covering (liquidating) their positions.[1]Short squeezes result when short sellers of a stock move to cover their positions, purchasing large volumes of stock relative to the market volume. Since covering their positions involves buying shares, the short squeeze causes a further rise in the stock's price. This newly increased price can in-turn trigger additional margin calls and short covering, which in turn may drive up the price further still in a vicious feedback loop. Short squeezes tend to happen in stocks that have expensive borrow rates. These expensive borrow rates can increase the pressure on short sellers to cover their positions, further adding to the reflexive nature of this phenomenon.",-0.9086

To those future owners who are going to get destroyed when this stock collapses, I offer my condolences to you ahead of time. Everyone one of you knows that you can not make a rational, logical reason why Tesla should be above $300. Even $200 is stretching it. Though Tesla is the main game in town if you want an EV today, in 5 years that will not be the case. Consumers will have dozens and dozens of alternative models from Europe, Asia, and the US to choose from that fit their tastes. Even if Tesla remains the number 1 brand for EV, the odds of it taking more than even 20% of the market share is small. So ride the wave up but be careful. I admit these levels make me too scared even to entertain buying Tesla. Sure it might go up $1000 more in the next 6 months. The house could collapse in a few months down to $400.

I do keep an eye on Tesla because I think it's a bit crazy, but I have more of a holistic view of the market.Good to know that wasn't your license plate. I thought it was interesting just the same.There have been lots of interesting developments over the past couple of months. Tesla sales are doing well, but I am not convinced they will make it to 500,000 deliveries (they may claim production, but that just means they have too many cars for Q1 in theory). I have been reading a lot on the hydrogen economy. Did you catch that the Netherlands just put in place a massive plan to jump start the hydrogen storage and transfer ecosystem. Of course Korea and China are going down this path as well, and it looks like parts of the Middle East may be doing the same. Not to mention the world of flow batteries and continuing declines (commoditization) of the solar market. Of course this bodes well for BESS systems, but it won't all be Tesla. They are still a zero in the battery market. Of course there are verified reports now of the growth and success of the solid state battery as well. I would still be cautious of expectations for major growth here before 2025, but the technology looks to be coming into the fore.At the same time, the Apple talk is interesting. I am not so sure what competitors will win, but certainly apple has a habit of getting things right on a massive scale. The point remains that competition is coming, quickly and it will change the world. It is just unlikely that the expectations for Tesla will match the share price anytime soon.Another note would be the three or four competitors who have full self driving capability on the roads today. Ahead of Tesla. Of course adoption is important, not just the abilities, but it is all coming. Honda was just certified with a true level 3 autonomous vehicle. Tesla is still at level 2. I don't care who wins. I care that there will be dozens of competitors and will eliminate Tesla's premium on valuation. That is the most likely outcome.Now we can disagree, but I have to admit, I won't likely be paying much attention for at least another week and a half. I am enjoying life . . . a lot . . . right now.(BTW, my bets on base metals are paying off pretty well. A mere trifle compared to Tesla, but the valuations are still way, way below economic value, so lots of room to run there.)Guru.",0.9973

They realize the EVs threat is going to come faster than even they expected. Proof: Tesla continues expansion into China and German factory locations. But here's the biggest IMO: in April 2020, $TSLA will hold their Battery Day event and I expect Tesla to announce their accomplishments over the past year since they acquired several technologies to help improve battery range dramatically. We could see a 30% improvement in range in Tesla vehicles coming out after April and on top of that, we will see a reduction for price to drop below $100 per kilowatt hour. This will be huge. I believe TSLA pps will go from today's low of $600 drive the price up past $1000. The oil sellers realized they don't have much time left as profits will drop significantly for them within 3-5 years as the world will have a massive EV transition. 5 years is what I give all other auto manufacturers to finally have EV models that will also be successfully selling to compete with TSLA to a degree, but this will be a bigger blow to the oil industry....not kill it.....but significant pain to their profits. In the past couple of weeks, you had one of the biggest auto makers announce they are fully committed to EVs more than ever....GM. Oil saw this too and after they had their emergency meetings to deal with a crisis that will start for their industry sooner than they expected, they foolishly decided cutting oil prices will help scramble for as much profits as possible for the few years left for them to take advantage of their monopoly over the auto industry.

That represents a 67.5% yearly share price growth (compounded) over the last 10 years (2011 - 2021)AAPL share price grew from $3 to $143 = 30% yearly share price growth (compounded) over the last 15 years (2006 - 2021)If TSLA share price were to grow at the rate of AAPL's share price (growth of 30%/year compounded) …. for 15 years …...from Jan 2011 to Jan 2026….starting at $5/share in 2011…we’d see that TSLA share price would grow to $256 (by 2026!)AMZN share price grew from $22 to $3300 = 32% yearly share price growth (compounded) over the last 18 years (2003 - 2021).If TSLA share price were to grow at the rate of AMZN's share price (growth of 32%/year compounded) …. for 18 years…..from Jan 2011 to Jan 2029…..starting at $5/share in 2011…we’d see that TSLA share price would grow to $740 (by 2029!)NOTE: Share price numbers are all split adjusted for all 3 companies …….Conclusion: If you’re gonna claim that TSLA current valuation is fair given that it should be compared to the growth rates seen from AMZN and AAPL then you’ll see that TSLA is way overvalued.,0.9508

Was just excelling around with the last 30 days trading data trying to give myself a better feel on the 30 day chart, here's what I found.Using Yahoo data - over the past month, 1,122,874,238 shares traded. 1.12 BILLION! Average daily volume of about 51 million shares traded.Not sure what the public float (tradeable shares) is post split, if anyone knows that number it would be a nice one to know.Those 1.12 billion shares were bought and sold at an average price of $573.85. I didn't use the average closing price for the day to arrive at that number, for each day I averaged the day high and low, then averaged that price over the past 30 days to calculate that number.From that, I would expect there to be a sh#t ton of support at $573 should we ever need it, lol. As I type this it's about to go through $649. So.....the shorts would like you to believe the sky is about to fall. Some overpaid analyst would even like you to believe the stock price is going to about zero soon.A drop to $573 from the ATH....is 12%. Barely a haircut, and hair grows back.And we are currently trading less than 1% below the ATH price.And tomorrow and Monday, the SP500 funds need to acquire roughly 112 million shares, by my calculations. Or roughly 2x average daily volume over the past 30 days.Plus all the other good stuff coming - deliveries number (expect a beat) , Q4 numbers (expect a beat), whatever new or refreshed that's going to roll off the S and X lines after the retool, and 6 months later we have Berlin and Austin bearing fruit.Just my take - limited downside to $573 at worst on the speculated 'dip' some are talking about.

If a big piece would go down, people would go in anxiety mode, everything would depend on how much You still believe. If You don't, You would die the momment this would go down a large piece. The momment when most people will stop believing in this, this stock will crash, but if people still believe in the ""Safe, high tech, zero emission future"" It won't crash. You have to understand that years and years younger generations been exposed to climate change, food additives, air pollution, and everything else to the point where everyone worries so much about their health, that believing in a Company like Tesla, all the news that Elon say's, how he say's takes away people minds out of years and years anxiety, Corona virus is a good thing for a company likes this too. People live in their own heads most of the time, worrying about everything, this company is like miracle for them. It's a problem soliution that they had for a long time, it's a wishfull thinking. Until Musk will say everything will be allright, people will believe that, because they had to. You want to believe that too. Another thing is Youtube, more and more people are sharing Musk and his companies news, so more people are getting into this everyday, it will grow little by little. As more people are getting exposed to what Musk and Tesla is. Memes are combined to reach out young audiences, as they are more likely to join Tesla becouse of the worries and fears they already have as I wrote prior to this. World is in ""Danger"" and Musk looks like the one who could ""Save"" everyone, even if he can't it doesn't matter, kids will be already exposed to this using memes. Musk is not stupid, everything he does is pure live advertising. The momment when he smoked weed, it's all about getting more and more people into this. Smoking weed looks a cool thing to younger audiences, as well as other pot smokers, they natturaly want to be a fallower as he looks like one of them. Everything about this company is more about human psychology, and emotions, not about numbers and revenue. Numbers do affect everything, but as long as this company just down fall by messing up something very bad, it will only go up. If you don't believe me, look up to a Elon Musk hall of fame video, watch it till the end, the way he ""Cares"" and almost cries, the way he messed up at the beggining of the journey with rockets, 3 fails, he spent his own money, and so on. Watch yourself, how do you feel after watching video like this? And imagine how a kid feels when he sees something like this. It's a dream, emotions that flow, he looks like real hero. Even if he is not, that I don't know, I can only assume he is a good gay. Anyway, I hope it may help someone to just to think how belief works, and what can it do. Other companies never worked on a ""Vision"" and belief before as good as Elon does, that's why this company is worth more then it should be.",0.9989

It's based on starry-eyed believers justifying Tesla with vague rationales like:It’s a software company!They’re so advanced!They’ll save the planet!They have rockets!You just don’t understand!And if everyone just keeps buying, the price keeps going up and everyone makes money. Like any pyramid scheme, you just need to keep recruiting new investors. There are still a few grandmoms and taxi drivers who haven't bought Tesla stock.Guess what - these silly stories can't go on forever. It ends when people can't afford to buy Tesla's stock anymore. When no cash is coming in, it doesn't matter if Musk is ripping bong hits or doing goofy dances. You can't have a stock rise a multiple of 8 times during a year of economic collapse/pandemic unless the company in question somehow profited from the economic collapse/ pandemic (hint, it didn’t). And just because many people have swallowed the Tesla stories hook, line, and sinker and banter around asinine arguments doesn't mean anything other than the fact that Tesla has become cultish and thus has had its stock balloon to preposterous proportions. For there will always be the small inconsequential issues of valuation and of profitability, you know the old outdated stuff that the rest of the business world is made of. LOLWe are witnessing the largest bubble in a generation. And its deflation will have a ripple effect everywhere…Tesla can't trade at these prices forever because the mirage, the illusion, eventually dissolves and the bright cleansing light of reality will shine through.

Old manufacturers will easily catch up with this company cause there is nothing unique to make entering the key business severe or impossible. And it is the quiet similar same case with $Xpev, $li, $kndi, $fsr, $lucid ($cciv) etc.This Tulip mania based on future expections for companys which will not exist. Never exist, because there is no demand for this kind of products. These companies are especially in china LUCKY because of the Subsidies. But we are about to enter a new episode in China with less subsidies and more need to Demand created through intrinsic motivation - the normal behaviour of humans.Only $NIO works on this issue, only $NIO is creating right before our eyes a whole new industry to create the demand with intrinsic motivation through building a big intrinsic brand value, a lifestyle Brand with many products beside of the EV aspect and a lifestyle brand many services beside of the ev aspect with building battery as a service industry, an autonomic drive as a service industry, a safety as a service industry - quite similar to ADAC in Europe and and and ....what do the others? Selling trash, compared to $NIO and once the demand in china is not statecontrolled anymore, NIO will outpoint its unique position on all spheres in this run. Even old manufacturers who trying to catchup with the ev startups will have to rethink their strategy in case of NIO because all of this things NIO is doing are cumulated the reinvention of the driving expirience quite similar to how steve jobs changed the world with the smartphone revolution.

Tesla's blind spot is the sub $25,000 EV auto and I think they will be beaten to the finish line with many other competent EV manufacturers already closer to that goal. Tesla is manufacturing 4 different types Vehicles out of ----> 100-200 different vehicles types used today. <---- ... that will be needed to replace ICE vehicles. When Tesla goes down (which is personally believe 2021 will be the year) it will take the whole EV industry with it, but fast rising names will be NIO, GM, XPeng, Li, Byd and maybe even Ford.

On October 15th they cut the price of the Model S again by $3,000. Conclusion: Cutting prices by thousands of dollars per units is easy. Cutting costs by even $5 per unit is very difficult.

Despite a cult following and intense brand loyalty, Tesla has been unable to wring any profits out of the half a million cars it now sells annually.To be clear, Tesla did report a profit for 2020, under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), marking the company's first full year of profitability. But that profit did not come from the core business of manufacturing cars. Tesla booked a whopping $1.58 billion of revenue from selling regulatory credits last year, more than the previous three years combined. Tesla's net income of $721 million in 2020 turns into a substantial loss if those regulatory credit sales are backed out.""And no it's not because of capex spending on new plants. Capex is depreciated, not deducted from revenue directly.But even if were, every already profitable car maker has capex spending that makes tesla's look like chump change. They would otherwise be all the more profitable and deserving of market caps in the multi-trillions by tesla stock price standards.$F alone should be $130/shr.

There are many states in the US that can barely handle the much needed air conditioners that are needed for our hot summers and cause rolling black outs in some states.

While it generally does well, it really choked in two instances: One was road construction with cones directing you into the oncoming lane, and the flow of traffic was being directed by a police officer. We could see his signaling, but it was confusing even to us. I don't see how FSD ever gets to understanding this - which makes me think the robotaxi business is a non-starter. The second situation where it got confused and required my friend to take over was on a highway where they had redirected the lanes (1/2 lane over) to make room at roadside for what looked like sewer work behind a barrier. The lane shift had new lines and somewhat stripped / scrapped old lines. FSD couldn't understand what was going on.I went into this with an open mind. And while system is impressive in 95% of road scenarios, it utterly fails in the last 5%. And this comports with what I've read - the last few percent of autonomous diving is 95% of the work.So in conclusion, I think you can cancel your robotaxi dreams.",0.8778

2397,"To show how overvalued Tesla is (and yes they are a great company with a visionary leader) let’s compare this to the biggest company in the world, Apple (who also had a visionary leader in Steve Jobs). In 07, Apple released their first touchscreen iPhone. They climbed to a market cap of 175B, while making close to 35B in revenue. Their P/E ratio at that time was less than 40 and they were trading around 6x sales. Fast forward to 9/2012, Apple reached a market cap of 650B (after 5 whole years and before crashing down to 365B) while making 156B in revenue with a p/e of about 12. In comparison, Tesla is expected to close out this year on 31B of revenue, while it has a market cap of close to 850B, trading close to 30x sales and has a p/e close to 1700!! This makes Tesla 5x (500%) more overvalued than what the biggest company in the world was when they released their most innovative product. Then, everything else that’s going on with the economy. People losing their jobs (unemployment at historic highs), small businesses closing left and right and last week they were expecting 70k jobs to get added to payroll, but instead 120k jobs were reduced. I get the market is forward looking but it must be looking 2+ years ahead these days and for Tesla, 5+ years ahead. Yes this will likely be a 1T+ company and bigger down the road, but with 100% certainty, they are wayyyy too ahead of their time. A crash is certain (for the whole market) but who knows when. I’ll stay on the sidelines in the meanwhile. The only thing driving this crazy market (especially this stock) is fear of inflation, FOMO and stimulus (not fundamentals). Just look at all of FAANG stocks and compare historic P/E ratios to this year.

2423,"Tesla boss Elon Musk admits car quality flaws, says mass production is ""hell""In a rare interview, the electric-car entrepreneur explains why Tesla has quality ups and downs – and reveals more about the next level of autonomous technology.Tesla CEO and founder Elon Musk has admitted the production quality, panel fit, and finish of his cars has at times been hit and miss, describing vehicle mass-production as “hell”.In a rare interview – and the first with automotive industry veteran and vehicle “tear-down” expert Sandy Munro –Musk was surprisingly candid about where Tesla could make improvements and promised the company would do better as it matured and ramped up production to a more stable level.On the YouTube channel hosted by Sandy Munro – a former manufacturing expert with big name car companies who now runs a business which pulls apart cars to find out how much they cost to manufacture and how they were built – the interview with Musk starts with a nervous comment from Munro about build quality, and the backlash he received from Tesla fanatics.After Munro described an example of a Tesla Model 3 having different panel gaps on each side of the car, Musk said candidly: “I thought your criticisms were accurate”.Munro said he noticed some Tesla cars had better quality than others.Musk then continued: “It took us a while to kind of iron out the production process, especially during a production ramp up.”Musk revealed that when friends ask him when is the best time to buy a Tesla, he says “either buy it right at the beginning or when production reaches a steady state”.“But during production ramp (up),” said Musk, “it’s super hard to be in vertical climb mode and get everything right on the little details … it’s just a super-difficult thing.”Musk said Tesla improved paint quality “quite a lot towards the end of last year and even in the course of December”.“One of the things that was happening when we were ramping (up) production … the paint wasn’t necessarily drying fast enough,” Musk said. “If (the production line moves) faster … it’s like you just discover these things.”He said before the production line sped up, the paint had an extra one or two minutes to dry.But without that extra time, the paint “was more prone to have issues”.After saying that was “just one example”, Musk said “production is hell”.In his defence, Musk said Tesla is the first American start-up car company in 100 years to achieve volume production.“Prototypes are relatively easy and fun [to build]… but reaching volume production with a reliable product at an affordable price is excruciatingly difficult,” said Musk.Munro, who is in the middle of a cross-country test drive in a Tesla Model 3 his company purchased for evaluation, described problems with the vehicle’s current self-driving autopilot technology.However, Munro raved about the next generation of the tech, after being given a sneak preview by a Tesla engineer following a test drive.Munro compared Tesla’s next generation of self-driving technology to fighter planes.“I’ve never ever seen anything quite like what you’ve got in the new self driving (tech).""This is just absolutely brilliant,” said Munro.“This should get into (showrooms) as fast as possible,” he continued. “It’s much more accurate than what we have in the Model 3. This will save more lives than airbags, seatbelts and anything else that anybody else has ever (invented).”“I was so impressed I couldn’t believe it,” gushed Munro. “I want the rest of the world to know what the new standard is. In the (automotive) world some people are going to win, some people are going to lose, and some people are just going to fade away.”In response Musk revealed Tesla developed both the hardware and the software and said “we’ve got a lot of talented people” – many of whom work across both Space X and Tesla.Following concerns about the ability of autonomous cars to “read” the road and difficult traffic conditions – and amid accusations that Tesla pushes the boundaries of technology – Musk gave a surprising response:“For self-driving (technology), even if the road is painted completely wrong and a UFO lands in the middle of the road, the car still cannot crash and still needs to do the right thing,” said Musk.“The prime directive for the autopilot system is ‘don’t crash’. That really over-rides everything, no many what the lines say or how the road is done … minimise the probability of impact while getting you to your destination conveniently and comfortably.”Musk said while it would “certainly be helpful to have roads with accurate markings” the car needs to be smarter than that.“For self-driving, it’s got to be even if someone tries to trick the car (that) they do not succeed in tricking the car, because people will do weird things, it’s got to be maintain safety no matter what … don’t let yourself (Tesla autonomous tech) get tricked.”",0.9978

Less and less food will be able grown. More and more animals will die. Mankind will begin to starve themselves. The toxic chemicals will destroy the oceans and less and less oxygen will be produced, thus man will also suffocate themselves. Why? Because everyone believed a greedy con man and followed him like pathetic little sheep. Are gas powered vehicles better? Not much, but at least we know how to dealt with the effects. Man will not learn what to do with all the toxic chemicals from EV batteries. My guess is that we will discover that just one of these batteries does way more damage then anyone thought.

Adding that he just weakened Tesla's ability to negotiate a strong buyout, Tesla almost needs to negotiate any kind of deal for a partial buyout now. Musk's only hope is that the Trump SEC is as dysfunctional as the rest of the government. This one is easy for the SEC to determine as Musk just revealed that the text was incorrect. If Tesla Board is smart, they will remove Musk from the daily management and start mitigating a very expensive error for the company.

2897," PLEASE READ   NEWS OF A TESLA TRUCK COMPETITOR; FROM TIP RANKS One potential competitor to Tesla, or, at least Tesla's proposed semitruck, could be Romeo Power (NYSE: RMO), the third SPAC in this list and one looking to make a name for itself in electric vehicle batteries. In fact, the company was founded by a team of ex-Tesla and SpaceX engineers. Yet instead of making an entire electric vehicle, Romeo is focused on making the very best battery packs in the world, in a flexible modular design, and aimed at the large commercial vehicle market.Why is Romeo so exciting versus other EV start-ups? According to an independent study by consulting company Roland Berger, Romeo's battery packs lead all competitors in terms of gravimetric energy density -- including Tesla's current batteries -- essentially offering best-in-class energy output for their given mass.Romeo actually has two big similarities to the aforementioned Latch. First, though very early in terms of producing revenues, Romeo has already contracted $544 million in future revenues, with $2.2 billion under advanced negotiation. Those future contracted revenues, as well as a vast $225 billion addressable market for commercial vehicles in the U.S. and Europe and $665 billion global market, help justify the company's current $2.34 billion market cap.Second, also like Latch, Romeo has a key strategic partner and large investor -- in fact, two of them: Borg Warner (NYSE: BWA), a leading auto part supplier, and Heritage Environmental Systems, which owns a large stake in Heritage-Crystal Clean (NASDAQ: HCCI), a leading recycler of batteries and other environmental services. Like Tishman Speyer does for Latch, the Borg Warner partnership gives Romeo instant access to many of the world's largest commercial vehicle fleet manufacturers.If Romeo continues to maintain or grow its current technology lead, and if its modular pack design catches on with a wide variety of commercial vehicles, there could be big things ahead for the company. Given the sheer size of the commercial vehicle market and the desire among large trucking fleets across several industries to go green and boost their ESG bona fides, Romeo could become one of the more consequential suppliers in the space in a short amount of time.While EV investors appear to be hunting for the next big brand, Romeo offers a best-in-class technology component, and should be a winner now matter which EV brand takes the crown in commercial vehicles.",0.9938

2970,"Tesla should establish an automatic, direct stock purchase plan. Under such plans an existing shareholder can automatically purchase shares of stock directly from the company on a monthly or quarterly basis. A fixed sum of money is periodically paid to the company and whatever number of full and fractional shares can be purchased for that amount is credited to the shareholder's account in book entry form. The share price is determined as an average of the closing prices for a specified number of trading days prior to the periodic purchase. A discount of 5% to the average market price is common. Dollar cost averaging results from the automatic and periodic purchases. A direct purchase plan is similar to a DRIP except the shareholder must make arrangements to automatically transfer money to the direct purchase plan.Setting up a direct purchase plan would establish a steady source of new capital flowing in from those who are most supportive of the company's goals - its current owners (shareholders). Shareholders are rewarded for participation by purchasing at a discount to the recent market price.",0.9947

Why: Too much real competition with many leading EV makers reaching 100,000 in volume in 2022, TSLA 2023 numbers going forward are going to get revised down. GM comes out as a surprise competitor whom may actually be better positioned than tesla (with many partnerships building cheaper cars and they currently hold the title for a best selling EV in China now) ! NIO has battery tech that seems to be better than Teslas, but Tesla's biggest problem is the $25,000 sub car market, you know the main part of the car market for the average consumer. Many EV manufactures are much closer to the goal of a mass market $25,000 < EV. GM is emerging as major competition for Tesla , NIO, XPeng, Li, BYD right now ! GM's stock will go up more than tesla's this year and possibly more than those other EV manufacturers as well. Everyone wrote off ICE manufactures but GM has been making incremental upgrades the whole time. Don't count out ford with the Mach-e either. As far as I'm concerned Tesla will maintain its market share on the higher end EVs but doesn't have a chance against EV competitors that already have sub $25,000 EVs. Tesla makes 4 vehicles out of --> 100 <--- different types needed to replace ICE. Keep in mind that Tesla's rise from 2017-2020 had a lot to do with traditional ICE manufactures only pretending to compete, because they believed Tesla would falter, well fast forward to now and we can see that it is a much different environment with ""everyone working on EVs""",0.3081

Just before Christmas, Tesla tore into Wall Street's most influential barometer - the S & P500 - sparking an additional buying wave. Tesla does not earn from the sale of electric cars, but from the sale of emission rights. The stock market value stands at a record $ 669 billion. In comparison, that is almost twice as much as the three 'classic' car manufacturers Toyota, Volkswagen and General Motors combined. Those three each produce about 10 million vehicles annually.

He is brilliant, talented, CUNNING, cruel, and not a very nice person, certainly not a sterling example of transparent honesty. He has had to wage war with ""the shorts "" and industry enemies who sought to destroy TSLA and for many years had the upper hand, but in the last year he has turned that around in a big way. So while I don't worship him as many do, I certainly have a deep respect for his warrior ability. I see his tweet as just the latest chapter in the story of the ""war"". He certainly does not intend to sink the stock, but rather to walk the fine line he perceives in the best interest of the company that is his baby and his source for riches.. A number of things come to mind, we know that many people around the world want to buy a TSLA, many would wait if a new technology was imminent . He cannot have that, he wants and needs current sales to be robust. On the other hand, he also needs to keep good news flowing to support the lofty shareprice. I am convinced he has that news, we will learn some of it today, there will be more in the future, he will walk the fine line as he sees fit. Those who short TSLA , especially on weakness , should bear in mind and take very seriously his formidable warrior abilities. I, for one , I am not dismayed about the tweet, it is classic, typical Elon. There is more reasons I can think of for the tweet, but for now the above will suffice.The above being said, those of you who have followed my posts, know that I anticipate much more reasonable share price action than the extremists on the board. The extreme pumpers who spoke of $600 and more this week NEVER were going to be right. Those who think the stock will be at $1000 by year end are also wrong.

3238,"ChargePoint ($SBE), the world’s largest EV Charging Operator and Equipment Provider with 70%+ EV Charging market share is going to go public via SPAC merge with $SBE, vote to finalize going public on 2/11 next Thursday. Unlike most SPACs we have seen that do not generate any revenue and remain in “prototype” or concept stage. ChargePoint ($SBE) generates $130 million dollars in annual revenue even before it goes public. Per my researches, ChargePoint’s revenue streams include the following:(#1.) L2 Charging Stations, most common charging, requires longer charging time but recommended for most EV charging, because the world’s available fast-charging technology would reduce lithium battery lifespan, if fast charging too frequent can also damage the battery which the most expensive part of the EVs. Therefore L2 (regular charging) was recommended until further break-through. L2 was recommended for most of the regular commuters while fast charging stations were recommended for Long-distance drivers or road trips. Please refer to the ChargePoint management presentation on their website with regards to the cons of pros of fast-charging and its impact to battery life.(#2.) Fast Charging Stations, ChargePoint also own large number of Fast Charging stations recommended for road trips and long distance drivers. In fact, ChargePoint has more fast charging stations than most of its competitors that focus exclusively on Fast Charging. The Fast Charging is not recommended for routine commuters due to its toll on the lithiumion battery lifespans. (#3.) At-Home EV Charging equipment, ChargePoint dominates this area including At-home hook up/converter/wiring that would allow 10X the charge speed and efficiency comparing to regular at home electric outlets(#4.) Software data application as a services, also known as SaaS recurring revenue, including subscription apps developed for station searching via phones and GPS, Charging efficiency management, battery analysis, etc. I personally expect once the ticker symbol changing from $SBE to ""$CHPT"" ChargePoint next week, we should see increasing and more consistent media and institutional investors coverage and attention, because ChargePoint is simply the largest, the best and the most crucial part of the EV revolution (basically it is the infrastructure of all EVs, like gas stations + oil companies to the internal combustion vehicles) and ChargePoint dominates 70%+ of the EV charging market, the #2 in line Tesla EV Charging station has about 10% of the market, and the rest $CLII $TPGY $DCFC $BLNK and others together competing over the remaining 20%. Thus massive Price Appreciation would likely to continue for ChargePoint after merge (unlike a lot of other spacs that dropped in price after merge, because those SPACs Do Not have Any Revenue going public only concept, but ChargePoint is the industry leader and had $130 Million dollars in revenue already). Ms. Grenholm, the newly appointed Energy Secretary is among one of the ChargePoint board of directors. This is the closest to the Tesla Story as it gets: 1. Dominating major part of the EV cycle and EV revolution, 2. Backed by the world's top auto giants and the energy secretary, 3. Already generating $130 million in revenue, plan on $2 Billion annual revenue in next 4 years while adding millions of charging points and stations.

That's why, absent extreme mania or ignorance among investors, stock splits do not move the total market cap. Telsa now as about 1 billion shares outstanding (before dilution by Elon coming option bonuses).Even assuming TSLA sold 1 million cars in 2021, to earn as much as $3.50 share for the full year, it would have to have a net profit (not just operating profit) of $3500 per car sold. That just isn't possible, especially when most of the assumed sales have to be in China or India since there is no way U.S. and European sales are going to top even 500,000 in 2021. They might even be down year over year.The reason it isn't possible for TSLA to achieve such high margins is that what TSLA can do in manufacturing, can be done by everyone else. There is no room for magic here. If TSLA can successfully use Robots on the production line to achieve substantial labor cost savings, there will be other manufacturers doing so as well. If automation is cost effect, it will be duplicated by competitors. This is especially true in new markets like China and India.",0.9421

(that is what the P/E is at $850, with $0.64 in annual earnings).There will almost certainly be a lot said of margins (blah, blah), but the two over riding realities are:1. Tesla used $1,580MM of regulatory credits to generate $721MM of GAAP earnings.2. Competition is coming.Good luck as these realizations come to the fore.(It is also worth noting that the operating costs for the new facilities has not yet started to accumulate, but the company's growth in unit sales (61%) contained a significantly larger portion of ever cheaper cars and Tesla's market share continues to dwindle due to both competition based on feature/function as well as price.).

I mean, $WATT has real wireless charging technology, how hard is it to make billions selling technology that actually charges through the air. No way a sucky company like $WATT deserves a $82 million valuation, I thought. But, then I remembered $PLUG is $38 now. I was going to buy $PLUG at $10, because I had a feeling it was going to $100, but I changed my mind after seeing its revenue and debt vs its market cap. Garbage $FCEL is $12, now! $QS, which hopes to see a small dime four years from now, is $130! $NNDM, which thankfully I stuck with, has sold nothing but shares in the last four months, to the tune of $0.5 billion and, yet, it is going up like crazy!I realized what is going on, the world has come full circle. The honor system is back in play with the new generation, as it should be. Many companies have found enormous success adopting the honor system. Amazon modeled its business around it, you buy and return willy-nilly. MCD has made it its culture. It is inherently necessary in online commerce. You accommodate it, you succeed big.The new generation have the honor system inherent in them, and it is beginning to reflect in the stock market, as it should be. The stock market is the heart of the economy, and society can no longer work without the honor system. It can no longer be about the limiting dynamics of the exchange of goods and services, but about the trust that within everyone is an inherent tendency to do good.

The beauty of the ""software as a service in the cloud"" model is that most of the costs (developing the software) is fixed regardless of the number of customers. Client acquisition is also a big expense, but, there there are large economies of scale and the dominant player is at a great advantage. Gross margins and operating margins are huge.But, despite all the protests that TSLA isn't just a car company, the fact is that nearly all its revenues comes from selling cars (or EV credits) and it is really just a car company. Growth will not greatly improve margins. You are not going to find buyers of a $25,000 car paying $10,000 for a self driving software package.

3797,"DETROIT (AP) — Tesla Inc. is balking at recalling about 159,000 vehicles with potentially defective touch screens, so U.S. safety regulators are moving to force the company to take action.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Wednesday sent a letter to Tesla saying it has tentatively determined that the screens are defective and pose a safety risk because they can cause backup cameras to go dark and defrosters to malfunction.The agency wouldn't comment beyond the letter, which is a rare step toward a public hearing and eventual legal action. Experts say the letter means that Tesla has resisted doing a recall that NHTSA feels is necessary.“It's obvious to me that Tesla told NHTSA to go pound sand, so what they're about to get, they've earned it,” said Frank Borris, a former head of the agency's Office of Defects Investigation who now runs a safety consulting business.Messages were left Wednesday seeking comment from Tesla, which is based in Palo Alto, California.Last June, the agency opened an investigation into complaints that the giant touch screens would go dark in certain 2012 through 2018 Model S cars and 2016 through 2018 Model X Tesla vehicles. It upgraded the probe to an engineering analysis in November.The letter says the agency has determined that the screens are defective because their computer processors have a finite number of program-and-erase cycles. NHTSA says the screens would fail in five to six years, which isn't sufficient for safety-critical features.“The lack of a functioning windshield defogging and defrosting system may decrease the driver's visibility in inclement weather, increasing the risk of a crash,” the letter said.In data submitted by Tesla, the agency found more than 12,000 customer complaints, field reports, warranty claims and other claims related to the screens, the letter said.NHTSA also determined that the failure rate for the screens is higher than the rate for vehicles involved in prior recalls for similar problems.Tesla tried to fix the problem with several over-the-air software updates, but NHTSA said it tentatively believes the fixes are insufficient.“I think it's planned obsolescence, which requires physical replacement of a part which Tesla tried to gloss over by sending a software update,” said Jason Levine, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety.The screen failures also can cause the loss of audible chimes and alerts that are part of Tesla’s “Autopilot” driver-assist system.The letter says that if Tesla formally decides not to do a recall, it has to provide NHTSA with an explanation. The agency can schedule a public meeting on matter and could turn it over to the Justice Department for legal action, Borris said.Borris, who reviewed the letter, called it very thorough and said NHTSA has a strong case should Tesla decide to challenge the agency in court.",0.9917

3948,"There are a few things that keep coming up that I think need clarification:1) Yes, ARK funds do sell Tesla shares. It's because they have to in order to balance the funds. If Tesla rises significantly, they have to trim shares so that a certain percentage of the fund isn't exceeded by Tesla alone, and so risk is managed. Since Tesla has been on a tear, it's value in the funds skyrockets. Anyway, it's just normal maintenance for very well-managed funds, and it signals no more than that. If you have doubts, visit the ARK Invest site, and look at the number of shares held vs. shares sold.2) Yes, Tesla is astronomically overvalued...if you're judging by standard figures and philosophy. But, as we know, Tesla tends to defy such valuation. There are a few analysts who have recognized this early on and several who are finally coming around to the idea. Tesla's value comes from the potential of all of its irons in the fire, not just current car sales and revenue. Even if we ignore the attraction to Elon Musk for his various endeavors, like SpaceX, and the ""irrational exuberance"" and cultish nature of the stock, we can't ignore the potential Tesla holds in various sectors: battery tech, solar power, electric utility, car insurance, autonomous cars and robo-taxis...and, oh yeah, cars. It's a long list. Yes, there are those who kick and scream about it, and it's understandable. Nonetheless, the reality is right in front of us. Has it crashed in the past? Sure, it's been quite volatile. Can it crash again? Absolutely. Can it continue to rise? Also absolutely. But one thing is for certain: It's real, and there are good reasons behind it even if they're not the typical ones.3) If Elon Musk decides he wants to sell some shares, good for him. I would if I had such a quantity. I have no idea what he plans to do with his fortune, but if he were to sell some shares, it doesn't indicate a loss of faith or guidance. Part of Elon Musk's compensation is stock. If he wants to sell some shares, he has every right to do so and should as he's worked hard for it and deserves his pay.4) Tesla is Musk's only publicly-traded company. To get in on the others, like SpaceX, requires high-digit private investment if there's any opportunity available at all. I do recall Musk mentioning that if Starlink goes public, Tesla investors would have first crack at shares. I'm not sure about the logistics of that, but it would be nice for us. Will SpaceX go public? Probably not as Musk likely relishes the freedom to not have to answer to stockholders on that one.Just my ""two cents."" Hope it provides some clarity for those with concerns and/or questions. Good investing and best of luck to all of us.",0.9972

3958,"I've received multiple questions about a specific, relevant issue.There seems to be a lack of understanding re process of the SP500 inclusion. Many expect an outsized move to satisfy demand by index buyers at the last minute. There are entities, let's call them financial middleman, arbitragers, individuals/firms with deep pockets who immediately upon the nov 16 SP500 committee announcement began to accumulate TSLA shares. These entities are not long term investors, they do things similar to this whenever opportunity strikes, so their plan was to buy TSLA shares with the express purpose of selling those shares to the last minute index buyers, particularly the passive index tracking funds. These entities will NOT hold TSLA shares past the close of post market trading this friday dec 18. So their accumulated shares are ""must sell shares"" , even as the passive indexers are ""must buy shares"". So the last minute buyers will have a very ample supply of shares to buy at the regular close or shortly thereafter in postmarket friday to satisfy their ability to mimic SP500 starting on monday dec 21. It has been largely the buying by these entities and others joining in that has caused the rise in TSLA stock , in this last month since the announcement , from the 400's to the 600's now. That is the ""spike"", a month long one , naturally with fits and starts. If there are more must buy shares than must sell shares available at the close the stock will tick up, if there are more must sell shares , the stock will tick down. The down this week has mainly been driven by some of the must sell people realizing that they may have overshot on the buying that they were risking giving up on the profits by waiting to do it all or none. So the down through wed, may have overshot the selling a bit and today we are seeing a corrective move in the opposite direction. While it is not easily discernible to determine the exact balance of must sell/must buy shares, the action so far is HIGHLY INDICATIVE of a VERY CLOSE balance being reached and thus the friday close is likely to not have a large spike up or down from wherever it is in the hours leading up to the close................",0.9904

The company aimed to have the lower cost vehicle available for purchase within the next three years using advances in battery manufacturing that would help lower costs.Now, a post from Tesmanian details government documents giving Tesla approval for a ""new model early launch project"" manufacturing process at Gigafactory Shanghai.Tesla China received approval on January 29, 2021, on an environmental impact report from the Lingang Area Development and Construction Management Committee, according to Tesmanian. This would allow Tesla to start construction of a factory where the new model would begin production.The report says Tesla didn't need to acquire new land and will build the facility on land the company already owns. The project will perform tests related to the launch of a new vehicle. The testing cycle is about six months for verification, coordination of parts and function.Last month, rumors sprung up that Tesla would be releasing its $25,000 vehicle in China in 2022. This new report shows Tesla is on track to meet that rumored deadline. Tesla is already a popular brand in China, and introducing a more affordable model would only increase demand.",0.9826

I have analyzed thoroughly and see that TSLA is sitting in the perfect position for the ""ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTIES"" ( the option mm's and their followers/players) to effect the VERY significant , most significant in fact option unwind in the history of TSLA. You see that this friday , the JAN 15 options will expire. These were the former leap options that have been around for a couple of years or so, so they naturally have a lot of open interest , but in fact, they have more open interest than ANY series of options that TSLA has experienced EVER. So much interest , that if you choose the strike price which renders the LOWEST dollar value of ALL the combined options outstanding for JAN 15 expiry added together. ( what all the calls and puts of the whole series would be worth if TSLA closes at that strike price), they would still be worth $14.3 BILLION . That compares with the analgous figure of $380 million for the Jan 22 expiration , a small percentage of the dollar open interest of the jan 15 exp. At yesterday's close of aprox $850, the jan 15 options would be worth aprox $22.6 BILLION .

4345,"Rumor: Tesla Model 2 Already Developed in China & Goes to Production in 2022On January 8, information was leaked from the Chinese media that Tesla had already developed a new car model, and would soon be ready to begin production at its Giga Shanghai. The affordable compact car is expected to be produced and delivered in 2022.According to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, some of the best works of art in the world were created in China, so he believes that projects created in China will also be popular around the world. The Chinese have always been distinguished by originality, speed, and intelligence, so China is a great place to develop, create, and implement the most original and unexpected solutions.At the ceremony of handing over the first made-in-China Model 3s to owners, which took place on January 7, 2020, in Shanghai, Musk announced that Tesla plans to establish its own R&D center in China, where the company will create a car for the whole world. Musk said:“Something that would be super cool...so we’re going to do it...is to try to create a China to actually design an original car in China for worldwide consumption. I think this will be very exciting.""As early as mid-January 2020, Tesla began recruiting employees for the new development center and called on them to help the company build Chinese-style cars.Today, the Chinese media, citing reliable sources, reported that the new Tesla car model already was approved as early as September 2020. Product verification is expected to be completed in March 2021, with production and first deliveries scheduled to begin in 2022. Tesla will build its new model at Giga Shanghai.According to sources, the chassis of the car is based on the Model 3 chassis, which will also speed up and simplify the start of production. Perhaps this is what made it possible to develop a new model so quickly. Estimated price will range from RMB150,000 to RMB200,000 ($25,000 - $30,000).When Tesla opened recruitment for the R&D center in mid-January 2020, the team used an image of an interesting new concept car. We've never seen anything like it before. Whether Tesla will develop something similar at the new Chinese R&D center, or it's just a picture that has nothing to do with Tesla's future projects, we do not know. But the new China-made model is sure to be as stunning as the entire Chinese Tesla project.Good luck and GOD bless,",0.9961

However, January 2021 marks the first time China has overtaken both Germany and the USA.Among the Chinese brands, the biggest improvers in January 2021 were MG and LDV (both of which are owned by Chinese conglomerate SAIC), and the recently renamed GWM Haval, which has begun combining its sales results across both brands from this month.In January 2021 versus the same month last year, MG sales were up by 162 per cent (from 919 to 2408) and the brand narrowly finished outside the Top 10 (in 11th place). LDV sales were up by 100 per cent (from 384 to 770), and GWM Haval sales were up by 135 per cent (from 326 to 769).Here is the country of origin data below:Source country of motor vehicles January 2021 sales Percentage changeJapan 29,275 up 29.6 per centThailand 16,903 down 6.1 per centSouth Korea 11,516 up 11.5 per centChina 4198 up 156 per centGermany 3078 down 42 per centUSA 2056 down 38 per centSource: Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries.",0.9803

4660,"Observations about @elonmusk's $420 LBO announcement:First, the context is odd: Musk promised on the conference call that $TSLA will be forever profitable. So why does he need to go private to ""end negative propaganda from shorts""? And why let them off the hook at $420?Musk suggests there will be no controlling shareholder in the LBO. He also says financing is already arranged. Ergo, he implies a syndicate of lenders has already signed documents for the deal. This is odd for two reasons...First, Musk recently rebuffed an investment offer from Saudi Arabia. If you're passing the hat for the largest LBO syndicate in history, why say no to a big check?Second, a $70B syndicate would involve numerous banks, dozens of lawyers, and multiple boards of directors. It's been [over] 12 hours since the announcement, and none of these parties has confirmed Musk's claims.Which raises a general point: a $70B dollar deal is a Jupiter-sized briar patch of legal and regulatory rules. It's a minutely choreographed thing, with legal risk for any party that says or does the wrong thing at the wrong time. With that in mind:Why did $TSLA not request a trading halt until an hour after Musk's tweet? Why did the company belatedly post an email from Musk, rather than an official statement? Why did Tesla not file an 8-K disclosing details of the purported LBO?Musk says he will not sell in the deal. What about his ~$800M in margin loans? Will lenders accept illiquid collateral? What about change of control provisions on $TSLA's debt? Who will fund the mandatory tender? Why did Musk's initial tweets portray this as a done deal, if his subsequent email revealed it to be merely his intention?Were these plans in the works when Musk publicly predicted a ""short burn of the century"" and a short squeeze larger than Volkswagen? Were they in the works when he aggressively purchased $TSLA shares in the premarket?If this deal is real, it won't be wrapped up for at least 6 months, and probably longer: a) need to assemble an independent board to vote on the deal (a court ruling this year decided that $TSLA's board is not independent of Musk), b) need a proxy statement with extensive risk disclosures (some think this is why $TSLA couldn't take the Saudi PIPE in the first place), c) need a shareholder vote, d) need antitrust review, even if perfunctory.Meanwhile, cash burn continues - in order to avoid default on their ABL, they must have cash/avail on Jan 1, 2019 sufficient to cover both 2019 convert maturities as well as a $400M buffer. That comes to $1.8B. At June they had $2.2B of cash and are burning close to $1B per quarter. Tough math.Musk says shareholders won't be forced to sell. How does that work? A private company with thousands of shareholders is still required to make SEC filings.

4744,"From Empire Research (Whitney Tilson), and I couldn't paste the charts here!....After its extraordinary run over the past year, electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA) closed yesterday with a market cap of $538 billion – making it the sixth-most valuable company in the U.S. – trailing only tech giants Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB).For any company to warrant such a high valuation, it must be extremely profitable or extremely rapidly growing – ideally both.Tesla certainly fails the first test, as it’s barely profitable – and not from making cars, but rather selling zero-emission vehicle and other regulatory credits.But at least it’s growing super fast, right?Well, as with seemingly everything about Tesla, bulls and bears disagree…The bulls argue that even with its main factory in Fremont, California, closed for two months and its new Giga Shanghai one shuttered for a month, Tesla is on track to sell a half a million cars this year, up 36% from 2019. Plus, the company is likely to sell 867,000 cars in 2021, up another 73% (estimates from @TroyTeslike – his full spreadsheet is here).On the other hand, Tesla bears argue that this growth is driven by launching new models and opening new factories, which is masking the reality that sales of Tesla’s “mature” products – the Model S, X, and 3 – are declining in its most mature markets: the U.S. and Europe.Let’s look at the data for the Model 3, which accounted for 73% of the cars that Tesla sold in the first three quarters of this year. This table (provided to me by a friend – here’s his source) shows unit sales, broken down by region, from January 2019 through October of this year (the latest period available). Note that U.S. data are hard to get, so those numbers are lumped in with the rest of world (“ROW”): At first glance, the numbers look decent: Tesla sold 19% more Model 3s in the first 10 months of this year relative to the same period last year. Then, add in rapidly growing sales for the new Model Y, and the growth story gets even more exciting, right?But when you break down sales by the three regions, you can see that Model 3 sales are actually declining in the more mature markets (U.S./ROW and Europe), and this is being masked by China sales as the new Giga Shanghai factory ramps up.Let’s first look at the U.S./ROW (the U.S. accounts for roughly 80% of this): As you can see, total sales are down in eight of the 10 months this year, for a total of negative 16%.In Europe, it’s almost as bad: Sales are down in seven out of the nine months, for a total of negative 14%.The only growth area is China, which isn’t surprising given that Tesla was starting from zero: It will be a challenge for Tesla to maintain growth in China when it has competition from literally hundreds of local companies (especially NIO).In conclusion, Tesla has become one of the most valuable companies in the world due almost entirely to its growth story – and indeed, at first glance, its growth has been impressive.However, the most impressive kind of growth comes not only from new products in new markets, but also from steadily increasing “same-store sales,” to use a metric common among retailers.Costco Wholesale (COST) is a great example. Though it’s been around for more than 37 years, in the past five years, the bulk retailer has grown revenue at a healthy 7.9% annually in two ways: growing store count by 3.2% annually, while at the same time increasing same-store sales by an average of 6% each year. Investors wouldn’t value Costco’s stock nearly as highly if sales at its mature stores were stagnant (or, worse yet, declining).Yet that appears to be the case with Tesla. Sales of Tesla’s primary car, the Model 3, are actually in double-digit decline everywhere in the world except for China.I am not advocating shorting the stock – I’ve seen too many of my friends get run over – but those who’ve had a wonderful ride on this rocket ship might want to bank some profits, especially if it’s in a tax-free account…",0.9986

4780,"Hey Tesla Long Term investors,Whenever I see a research analyst doing one of these doom and gloom prediction on TSLA price, I start to pay attention. JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman in December upgraded TSLA price from $80-90, and I was like ""what's up with that"" with a sell rating. Because I have about 4.5% of my portfolio tied to TSLA, and I want to make sure I see what he is seeing. So I did some research on what the guy is about. I just want to report back that I don't have too much to worry about, and let me explain.The guy is a legit automotive research analyst having more than 10 years of research experience in the automotive sector. My problem is not with what background he has, but it's what he does not. We all know there has not been a whole lot of innovations in the automotive industry except TSLA, until this year when all the automotive legacy companies jump on the bandwagon because of TSLA's established success in this area. But we all know TSLA is not just an EV manufacturer, it's also autonomous driving(artificial intelligence), battery technology with current production (unlike another company called QS), energy storage, robotics, Software Development, Car insurance, HVAC...etc. Now how could a guy like that covering all these areas with just automotive research background with a MASTER Degree in accounting. Oh my god, just we need, another research analyst with accounting background. If it's that simple, Joe from our own Chat room can do his job easily. I think an ideal person for this type of analyst has to have a combo of 5-7 years of auto manufacturing industry, 2-3 years of SW industry, 2 years of artificial intelligence/robotics experience, and a couple years of solar energy solutions industry. An analyst with this combination of experience would be very expensive for investment banks, but it's absolutely necessary to cover a company such as TSLA well.Additionally, I always want to see what credibility does this guy have. I have extracted some information on Brinkman's past performance from Tiprank(a site which keeps the performance of stock research analysts)and share with everyone in the forum:Ranked #6,701 out of 7,182 Analysts on TipRanks (#14,083 out of 15,010 overall experts)Average return of ratings he gave out: -4.4%I don't know about you, but why is the media even give this guy the time of the day given that terrible performance record?",0.9977

Selling at the very peak of a climax top is essentially the great fishing story for investors. Many will claim it, few will achieve it.Investors may want to sell some Tesla stock into strength, because when a climax top occurs, shares can fall to earth even faster than they rise.After a climax run, stocks often suffer huge declines that take years to recover from. Qualcomm (QCOM) finally surpassed its 2000 climax top peak last year.Tesla stock had a climax-type run in late 2019 to early 2020, peaking on Feb. 4 at a split-adjusted 193.80. Shares then plunged 64% to 70.10 on March 18, with the coronavirus market crash no doubt contributing to the losses.Perhaps Tesla stock will have a climax top, sell off and rebound rather quickly once again. But do you want to sit through a 30%, 50%, 80% decline on hopes for a rebound? If Tesla stock corrects or crashes and then bounces back, investors can always buy it back.

4918,"Five Steps of a Bubble (from Forbes)Minsky identified five stages in a typical credit cycle -- displacement, boom, euphoria, profit taking and panic. Although there are various interpretations of the cycle, the general pattern of bubble activity remains fairly consistent.1. Displacement: A displacement occurs when investors get enamored by a new paradigm, such as an innovative new technology.2. Boom: Prices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain momentum as more and more participants enter the market, setting the stage for the boom phase. During this phase, the asset in question attracts widespread media coverage. Fear of missing out on what could be an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of participants into the fold.3. Euphoria: During this phase, caution is thrown to the wind, as asset prices skyrocket. The ""greater fool"" theory plays out everywhere. Valuations reach extreme levels during this phase. During the euphoric phase, new valuation measures and metrics are touted to justify the relentless rise in asset prices.4. Profit Taking: By this time, the smart money --heeding the warning signs --is generally selling out positions and taking profits. But estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise and extremely hazardous to one""s financial health, because, as John Maynard Keynes put it, ""the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.""5. Panic: In the panic stage, asset prices reverse course and descend as rapidly as they had ascended. Investors and speculators, faced with margin calls and plunging values of their holdings, now want to liquidate them at any price. As supply overwhelms demand, asset prices slide sharply.Many diehard Tesla fans are still euphoric in phase 3 while smart money take their profits and leave before it falls.BTW Audi's new EV looks very cool",0.9951
4919,"It was reported today that Koreans own $10 billion worth of TSLA. Assuming 50 rich countries, outside the US, each own $10 billion worth of TSLA (on average,) that is $500 billion worth of TSLA owned by investors from other countries. We can also assume investors from the poorer and less advantaged countries together own 10% of that amount, or $50 billion worth of TSLA. This means American investors can own and bid for only $250 billion worth of TSLA, right now. However, thanks to the shorts, a little more of TSLA artificially exists for investors to buy. To sum things up, it is inevitable that TSLA will be going up big time.",0.9202

Proponents of the stock will recklessly promote it and will tell you not to believe posters like me. They will tell you that I am spreading FUD. But I am honest and presenting the reality. You should read the arguments from both side before risking your money in this stock.To anyone considering Tesla, understand that 1) it has had an amazing run that defied all standard expectations for a stock given the company's actual financial performance 2) past stock performance is NOT an indicator of future results 3) by every metric of company valuation, Tesla is grossly overpriced, 4) Tesla has overpromised and underdelivered repeatedly with respect to its products, and 5) Tesla does not have any ""lock"" or monopoly on any of its business.You can ""believe"" in Tesla the company, its supposed mission and Elon Musk. But none of that means that the current price for the stock is appropriate or sustainable. Proponents or ""bulls"" will regurgitate that it's the ""future"" without elaborating. They will tell you it's more than a car company, despite well over 90% of its revenue coming from cars sales. They will disregard competition from existing automakers and new EV startups. They will do just about anything besides admit that they have been wildly lucky and hit the equivalent of the lottery with Tesla's past year runup. So just think about it before you buy...",0.968

This indicates that Toyota needs to produce 8.8 million cars times 9.21 years of earnings to meet market cap. This total is 81,480,000 vehicles.Tesla produced 500,000 cars last year. Their PE is 1,628 and this is not a fully diluted PE. Multiply the two and the total is 814 million cars. Fully diluted and this number nears 900 million. There is not enough raw material capacity to achieve this in the next 10 years. World auto production in 2019 was 91,786,861. Tesla, at their present margin ratios which would include the sale of regulatory credits, would need to sell every car in the world for 10 years to have a PE similar to Toyota.

5049,"Musk's option compensation plan provides for 12 tranches of grants totaling a little over 100 million shares with an exercise price of about $70. The 12 tranches have a market cap requirement starting at $100 billion with $50 billion increments up to $650 billion. This market cap has to be sustained for both 30 day and 200 day moving averages. Right now, the 30 day moving average requirement is satisfied for all 12 of the tranches. The 200 day moving average is now around $400/share, well below the $650 market cap level since TSLA didn't move up to $650 billion in market cap until December, 2020. But, if the stock stays above about $675 for another 4 months, the market cap requirement will be satisfied for all 12 of the tranches. The important thing to understand, once this is achieved, it doesn't matter what happens to the stock price as far as the vesting of the options go.The second requirement for vesting of tranches involves 8 revenue levels and 8 adjusted EBITA levels. Any one of these can be used 1 and only once to activate one tranche of grants. So far, it appears that the first 2 revenue milestones ($20 billion and $35 billion) will be satisfied in 2021 as 4th quarter 2020 revenues were over $10 billion. The next levels ($55 billion and $75 billion) might well be satisfied when TSLA first sells 1 million and then 2 million vehicles respectively. This would be 4 of the 8 revenue milestones. If say by 2025 TSLA TSLA sells 5 million vehicles at an average price of $35k, all 8 of the revenue milestones will have been satisfied.But, Musk doesn't need to have all the revenue Milestones satisfied. The first 5 adjusted EBITA milestones either have been or will shortly be satisfied already as the adjusted EBITA was already at $1.85 billion for 4th quarter 2020 and the milestone of more than a total of $8 billion for 4 consecutive quarters requires only a modest increase in EBITA in the next 2 quarters to be reached. It's reasonable to expect adjusted EBITA to exceed $14 billion (the top of the 8 milestones) by the end of 2022.Achievement of 8 EBITA milestones and 4 revenue milestones will be enough to vest the options (assuming the market cap milestone is satisfied, which seems certain baring a sharp decline in TSLA stock. Musk will then have options to buy 100+ million shares at $70/share.If TSLA really is a $800/share stock at that time, this grant will be worth over $70 billion dollars. Not a paid payday for at most 5 years work. If you have a corporation which does great, except it costs nearly $15 billion year to pay the CEO, it is going to be hard to have much left over for the common shareholders.What will the next pay package require? Not likely that Musk will be so foolish as to settle for options when he already has 100 options ""in the bank"".",0.984

Now look at the expense structure for both manufacturers, Tesla doesn't have a combustion engine division that needs to phase out.

5314,"I see that $IZEA made a $35 million (5 million share) offering. Well, $JMIA, $NNDM, $FCEL, $NIO, $GME, and $TSLA continued rocketing to the moon after their stock offerings. The stock market exists in a different dichotomy (first time I use this word) than it did in the past. My first experience in the stock market was in the 2005-2006 period, which is relatively close to after the DOTCOM bubble. It was a horrible bear market, then, all you could do as a long was watch your steady demise. Look at the 2005-2006 charts for most companies, to see why anyone immersed in the days of those years saw no hope. A stock offering done at that time was an immediate death knell for the stock of the company doing the offering, sending the stock into a tailspin down to $0.Jump to 2021, and things couldn't be any different, things couldn't be any better! Along with the start of a new era of smart tech and forward thinkers, we are experiencing one of the best stock markets ever. The stock market is no longer about revenues and profits, but about causes. Now when there is an offering, the FED steps in to keep the floor from falling under investors' feet. The idea is to recognize economic realities, that livelihoods should not rely on what commercial activities dictate, but on the objective values brought to society. Let me explain with examples. $JMIA cannot be worth what it is worth now and in the future based on financials, but it is the Amazon of Africa, and it is indispensable for Africa's future. Similarly, $IZEA cannot be worth what it is worth now and in the future based on financials, but it is enabling influencers to earn an income, a growing, and today very important and relevant, segment of the population. By helping to support influencers, $IZEA is performing an essential service and, therefore, must be placed at high value.",0.98

Liquid “Green” Hydrogen Fuel (Clean, ZERO Emissions) — versus — Toxic Batteries charged by an electric grid using primarily dirty fossil fuels. And, batteries are putting a tremendous strain on the electrical grid — increasing the potential for “black outs”;(2). 500 MILE RANGE per Liquid “Green” Hydrogen Tank; So, install 2 tanks and drive for 1,000 Miles —> “DOUBLE THE RANGE” of a battery semi truck;(3). 5 to 6 times FASTER REFUELING —> Time is money. By the time a Battery Semi is getting charged, a Hydrogen Fuel Cell Semi Truck is already at their destinations loading dock — unloading their cargo! — LOL. (4). LOWER OPERATING COSTS —> PLUG POWER offers Real Time IoT Monitoring of Predictive Service/Maintenance!With PLUG POWER vertically integrating to build the “GREEN HYDROGEN SUPERHIGHWAY” across America, the issue of a lack of fueling stations will soon be a NON-ISSUE :).

You were all used to take out one target and set up a huge short opportunity!! You fell for it hook line and sinker!!They knew how you want so badly to be important and show how grown up you are.

5482,"What is happening here is easily understandable, so let me explain it to you quickly: GME and AMC have been creating massive losses for funds, forced to cover their short (lol). To balance their losses, they have had to close their long time positions like those ones on Tesla, bringing down the price. But this is only a drop in the ocean. Tesla is strong and will only need a few hours, if not days to climb back up, and remain even tougher than before. ""Deceiving"" earnings won't bring it down, Tesla is still a leader, has massive market shares in batteries, and, because no one is talking about it, just introduced the new model S and X. Those new cars are not only better looking (inside and outside), they also have longer range (from 628km to 840km autonomy for the higher version), a top speed of 320km/h for the Model S Plaid +, and 0-100 in just 2.1 seconds.

Then it recovered for about 1/2 hour, then resumed falling more. That happened 2 or 3 times during the day and ended the day at the low, down almost 23%. I don't remember any major stock avoiding the fall that day. I was actually not surprised, because on the Oct 16, a program called Wall Street Week featured, among other guests, Marty Zwieg. He was a highly respected market analyst. Louis Rukeyser asked him about the market. That day, Friday Oct 16, the Dow had fallen about 100 points, almost 5%. HE said something slightly out of character ""I am worried........"". He was usually very careful not to be so direct. Rukeyser did not press him to elaborate. I think Louis knew full well Marty might be right on and a much lower market was very close. Little did they know the extent and sharpness of the fall the following Monday. I have never lost the impact of that market psychology leading up to that Monday. I now have a very similar sense for Monday, Oct 29, 2018. If not that day, then sometime during next week. That fall could be sudden and short lived like 1987 or it would be like Oct, 2008 when the steepest part of the fall lasted much of October. I seem to remember 2 or three days that month, the Dow fell about 1000 points during a day. I think the crash we will see next week will be more similar to 2008.",0.3467

I am long with TSLA but who knows may sell off some profit only should they go above 1k a share. Currently holding 350 share post split, started buy a few here a few back in May.

So many just don't get it that TSLA is tech, software and hardware. I do think it will split again in 2021 just for the fact of how ambitious Musk is and all the projects and dreams he has.

I belong to the latter, having shorted a share that has been one of the best performers in this century.Tesla Inc. is coming to the end of its first year selling China-made cars with a commanding position in the world’s biggest electric-vehicle market, but Elon Musk shouldn’t rest on his laurels.While Tesla regularly topped monthly premium EV sales tallies this year, helped by the sedans churned out from its multibillion-dollar plant opened to much fanfare in Shanghai last December, 2020 was also marked by rivals catching up. In 2021, the breadth of the competitive attack that Tesla faces will be greater than ever.Whether Tesla can defend its lead in China will be key to its wider growth and earnings trajectory. While still in its infancy, China’s electric-car market dwarfs that of other countries and the government is intent on further expansion amid commitments to reduce fossil-fuel use. Tesla’s fate in China will also show whether it can grow into a truly global carmaker, an ambition investors are banking on after pushing the company’s shares up almost 700% this year.Chinese automakers are notorious for building copycat cars that look just like the real thing but deliver underwhelming performance and quality. EV manufacturer BYD is putting a stop to that stereotype by offering what they hope to be world-class cars.Investing in India  and Macro Trends (QE, Zero Interest Rates) | Value Investor TV - Podcast #126https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ngc2VwUUHI&t=209s",0.9852

Li Auto’s delivery forecast for the current is anywhere between 11,000 to 12,000 vehicles. By comparison, Tesla delivered over 11,000 vehicles in China in the month of July alone.Its competitors ,though growing, are still not at the same scale as Tesla.

Since he put his crudential in Linkedin, I reviewed it today.It's interesting, he has been at every company he worked for about 2 years (3 for1 year each, and 3 for 2 year - covering health industry and chip industry), and then he had worked at Axiom as a managing director for 10 years (covering material science). So I would say he would specialize in material science as he has not done so for health and chip for more than 10 years. He has no experience in automotive industry, neither does he have any experience in AI and Datascience. He has been in his CEO position for barely a year. Now I understand he has a credibility issue, no one believes him. If I were buying research report, I would not buying from him.From the nature of his CEO position, he is just selling research on the company he covers. I am really not sure how he gets the funding to short it, I think he is probably shorting it himself. Another word, I think he is full of it.

Following a greater than 700% run higher over the trailing year, Wall Street is looking for a retracement of 41% to its one-year consensus price target.Obviously, Tesla has done something right, or it wouldn't be up more than 700% in 12 months. In 2020, the company was short only 450 EV deliveries of CEO Elon Musk's promised goal of 500,000. Still, it's an incredible accomplishment for an auto stock built from the ground up.Tesla also continues to hold tangible competitive advantages in the technology department over other auto stocks. During its September Battery Day event, the company unveiled its next-generation battery, which will improve range by 16%, increase power by a factor of six, and offer five times the capacity. Slowly but surely, the possibility of a $25,000 EV is taking shape. However, the big knock against Tesla is that it's still not profitable from selling EVs. It's reported a profit in each of the past five quarters, but in four of those five quarters, it was aided by the sale of renewable energy credits. Investors shouldn't have to worry about a nearly $800 billion company still being unable to generate a profit from its product or service.",0.9336

Tesla's biggest mistake was it's top down strategy, ie. building few more expensive cars and gradually reducing costs to get to the mass market sweet spot of $25,000. That approach will end up costing Tesla as we have already factored in the growth moving forward. Did we all forget that companies like ford and GM has major advantages over Tesla and NIO (NIO: who doesn't even own their own factory), GM and FORD has international manufacturing, deals with other automakers and to a certain extent have already re-tooled for EVs, both GM and FORD have competitive EVs now but they also make EV vehicles that Tesla hasn't even moved into yet like delivery trucks !

5938,"TSLA is not an investment, it's a momentum play. And when playing with momentum, you never know when you're going to lose and how much you're going to lose. Consumer Reports just rated Tesla 25th out of 26 due to its bad reliability. But everyone will ignore such studies and such overvalued fundamentals because Tesla is a marketing genius and now everybody dreams of holding a stock which 10-fold in a year. Stop dreaming, be rational, this won't 10-fold every year. After a 10-fold, it will most likely underperform. And once reliability issues spreads while other well established car makers continue to take their part of the market, it'll be hard times for Tesla investors. This hype may continue through the first half of 2021, but don't try to time the market. I'm not bearish. But I know I'll be buying an EV in 5 years and Tesla doesn't fit my needs while other car makers are already selling EVs which fit my needs. And I'm certainly not the only one. And I know that Tesla is not only a car maker, but at $600B you better deliver. A lot. I'm super happy for you guys who 3-fold, 5-fold or even 10-fold with Tesla.
