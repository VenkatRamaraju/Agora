17,"Robinhood drew down its credit lines and got a $1 billion cash injection from investors. But even that tidy sum was really only enough to cover what had transacted to that point. If Robinhood customers were going to keep buying GameStop at higher and higher prices, Robinhood would have to fork over billions more to, by that point, a completely freaked-out DTCC.There were no more billions to be had, at least not easily, so Robinhood threw cold water on the party; they simply stopped customers from buying any more GameStop shares. There was no problem selling your shares, but you couldn't buy for love or money.Ultimately, there was no sinister ""one hand washes the other""-style conspiracy to save floundering hedge funds; there was no secret bargain to deny retail and day traders the chance to make a, frankly, well-deserved killing.

46,"This all started as a brilliant short squeeze that ended the day before the peak, because the shorts were covering. The problem is that people didn't know the rules, and the brokerages did not have the capital to handle the volume, just like in other wild market events. This became a classic pump when Chamath and Elon whipped up buying frenzy to deceive those who did not want to think for themselves. It became a dump when self serving guys with no skin in the game like Marc Cuban encouraged everyone to hold. The game comes to an end with Portnoy ""I'm smarter than Warren Buffet"" selling out at a major loss.  are what other people tell you to do so that they can get out and leave you as the bag holder. It is a con.The gamestop management were too stupid to issue shares when they had a once in a lifetime opportunity. Even the management in this company seem incompetent.

Already generating revenues. Not that it matters in short squeeze plays.So here is the real juice:25% short interest17,900,000 shares are short79m float .The average volume is about 1mm shares a day. That is a HUGE short position both % wise. And in actuality since the Volume average is about 1mm per day. I’m in it long term. But timing wise , I just missed DVAX, JNCE, VXRT.So I said .. there squeezing the biotechs hard now that retail squeeze ran its course .The stocks that already moved above .. AND HRTX- the common thread is BAKER BROTHERS.... most well repeated fund is among then largest shareholders... 2) GNW- genworth A leader in mortgage insurance and term life ins. With home mortgage refinance and purchases at record levels . Many are putting down less then 20% with higher home prices / appraisal values. With record low interest rates. Hone owners can afford the payments but don’t always have the 20% needed for down payment or equity % on refinance. To boot, they had a takeover offer form financial instit based in China . But genworth backed out do the deal as they feel they can get a better buyout price .. they just sold their Canadian MTG ins portfolio for $1BB. GNW market cap is only $1.6BB.They do 2BB in revenue . She they backed our of the deal the stock came down to $3 from just under $5. Shorts seizing the headline . Now they can negotiate a better deal, they have a cash hoard . Paid down debt and their revenues / EPS are in great spot with mortgages booming .Shorts have to cover . 15mn short 3) KGC- kinross gold.EPS up 100% each of last 2 years , and they expect 100% again for full year . When they report next week they are on pace to see 100% EPS forest for ‘2020, which is the 3yr in a row . 24m shares short, earnings next week. And the silver short squeeze rallyIs spilling into Gold now as well. Gold futures up 8-12 points I’m overnight session. Silver also in 4% overnight .

I can't predict what's going to happen but im an optimists and i know if we just buy and hold till we as retail investors have the majority of the shares in the bank pool. The key to adding pressure is to have buying demand and we can create demand and add pressure and a some point the cost for each stock will ridiculously rise . Shorts are multi billionaires and they're not going to fold so easily but if we stick to our guns and hold till they cant no more than we all become wealthy if not wealthier. Look the shorts cannot control the market but the banks and retailers/ hedgers can by strategically financing into the system. Unfortunately shorts have picked the wrong spectrum in time to choose to choose AMC as a short interest. Call it the luck of the draw, illegal, manipulation etc. Simple fact is we're here and we're going to make history and transfer amd and distribute the wealth back to the people. If it took you just the bit of time until financials are returned for AMC to become a multimillionaire would you wait or sell it at what the average individual thinks its worth I've heard $20-$40 as reasonable. Ok lol it would be reasonable if it occurred everyday however thats not the case. Multi hundreds of millions is being poured out into AMC you better understand this is like a treasury stake on hand. I wouldn't treat or sell a wuality diamond for $20-$40 would you? My suggestion is wait for Feb 9 and financials and don't panic when you see the short sale ladders or if you see 30% down etc. We're all going through the emotions believe me i get it. And it's a longtime but guess what with hard and smart working skills we can all do this together. I'm sure you understand what I'm saying but then again you may not but if you do your research and analyze it all things are working in favor for the little guy. Hang in there folks BUY AND SELL. This squeeze has a lot to do with financials and money distribution its the fundamentals of AMC why we're all here today discussing what to do with your assets. They only risk you have to identify is what the shorts moves are and so far they seem to be a bit predictable because their desperate. It may seem like their not panicking at the moment but it it happens to them more than we believe. Look the shorts are going to get caught with their pants down the only thing we have to do is suit em up buy em and hold em until we can send them back to the free market. Right now those that are invested in this and are holding yes we are in control. If they win this is $40-$59 if we hold longer all together when that time comes we will win quadruple that but the question you have to ask yourself is can I wait till feb 9th can i wait till financial reports arrive can i stomach the non RRS in place? Etc. I WANT THIS TO BE AT LEAST 10K per share and I'm not selling until it is. Look at lindt stock ask yourself why a chocolate company has a higher valuation than most? This is about money and the money right now is in AMC, GME, ATOS etc. We must stay the course lets not give up. Remember these bad times but in the end you will live out your dream in real life just as long as you hold until they fold. LETS GO ",0.9992

440,"So what happened exactly? My guess is that the original shorts (Melvin, etc.) really did cover their positions early last week and then they took new short positions at the ridiculously high prices that we saw on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Posters here and on Reddit were citing the ever increasing short interest as evidence that the real squeeze had not happened yet, but they did not account for the fact that the old shorts had already been squeezed out and the rising short interest was the result of new shorts taking their place at much higher price levels that were going to be virtually impossible to squeeze. The higher the price of $GME got, the harder it got to push, and the retail investors (if it even was them doing to real pushing, it easily could have been other Hedge Funds) that were really committed to pumping the stock had already sunk all their capital into it by the time it reached $350 or so, so it lost it's upward momentum. That the trade volume didn't align with Melvin's claim to have covered their shorts was regularly put forward as proof that they were lying about covering, but the trade volume was >450M over a 3 day period, and there were only ~70M shares that were shorted so that claim never made sense. There was lots of talk that the high interest rates that the shorts were paying to hold their positions would eventually force them to capitulate, but again, they were new shorts at higher price levels, and it was not as though one hedge fund shorted 140% of GME's float. Those short positions were spread throughout the market and the cost of borrowing, whatever it was, was likely insignificant to the multibillion dollar institutions that were shorting GME, and the huge returns they were looking to make when the price inevitably collapsed.",0.9789

609,"In 2009, the entire world (including Cramer) said that Banks were dead and not investable. What happened next?Banks continued to outperform the market for the next decade.If you invested in banks at or near the low, you made a fortune.Since March of 2020, the stock market has irrationally declared oil companies as dead. They point to the lack of demand due to COVID.The COVID demand issue removed 5 million barrels per day of demand from the market. The oil market demand is currently 96 million barrels per day. This is a demand reduction of less than 5% during the worst pandemic in a century.As as they declared banks as dead in 2009, pop culture says that COVID has made oil dead. Just as in 2009, they’re wrong.Oil inventories in the US and China continue to drop. COVID cases are dropping precipitously. Vaccines are being distributed. Demand is back.Meanwhile, world leaders are making oil drilling nearly impossible due to environmental concerns. This means supply is limited in a rising demand scenario.The result according to Goldman Sachs, is the beginning of a new secular bull market in oil. For the next 12-15 years, oil will be priced at over $100 a barrel.This means huge profits for the oil companies. These profits will be used to buy out wind & solar competitors as the world transitions to green.If you lost big in $GME or $AMC, or you gained big in $TSLA, now is the time to invest in oil companies. Buy $XLE $CVX $XOM $OXY $ET & $GEL.It’s like buying banks in 2009. You will be rewarded big.",0.8051

Another mod, disabledsexrobot, announced on WallStreetBetsTest that they were resigning from the original WallStreetBets in protest.This comes amidst a reckoning as GameStop’s stock price continues to plummet. It started trading at just over $90 Thursday and is currently trending downwards to just $50. The subreddit that started meme stock mania is now coming apart at the seams, egging each other on to “hold the line” and not sell their existing shares, while others try to tease out how this all ends without them losing a bunch of money. This groundswell of desperation has led redditors to make pleas to billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Cuban. Nevermind that said billionaires are beneficiaries of the same rigged Wall Street system that some on WallStreetBets purported to be fighting, leading to support behindGameStop and AMC stocks. Meanwhile, some investors who were winning big just a week ago are now coming to grips with steep losses as the whole thing unravels.Subreddit power struggles are nothing new, especially when they grow exponentially almost overnight. Of course, none have been at the center of big financial controversies before. Congress is currently set to hold hearings in the House about GameStop and other meme stocks on February 18.

As the camera moves across the suit, the voice-over intones, “This fall Inspiration4 launches as the first all-civilian mission to space, and you could be on board.” The commercial ends with an invitation for viewers to go to space, and to visit the mission’s website, www.inspiration4.com, to learn more.The commercial was fittingly directed by the actress, producer and director Bryce Dallas Howard, for whom space has held a personal fascination since childhood. She is the eldest daughter of actor and filmmaker Ron Howard, who directed the iconic and Academy Award-winning film “Apollo 13,” a profile in courage of the ill-fated third lunar landing in 1970. In addition to her acting credits, Howard has also directed episodes of “The Mandalorian.”Howard’s direction of “Join Us” is accentuated by unexpected and inviting music and voice-over. A fresh and enchanting take on the timeless lullaby “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” is provided by Celeste, a British-Jamaican singer and songwriter who won the BBC’s “Sound of 2020” poll and the BRIT Awards’ “Rising Star” prize last year. Her debut album, “Not Your Muse,” was released last week via Interscope Records. Voice-over was provided by Academy Award-winning actress Octavia Spencer.Regarding her role in directing the commercial, Bryce Dallas Howard said: “To me, this was an undeniable opportunity to present the ultimate Golden Ticket. This mission represents just how much humanity has to offer, and it was essential to capture that in everything from the photography of the SpaceX suit to Celeste’s beautiful soundtrack. I got to reunite with some longtime collaborators to make this happen: John Schwartzman behind the camera, Octavia Spencer as our voice, and ILM in the edit. And working with SpaceX, Shift4, and Known, it was like we were kids again re-discovering the awe and wonder of the cosmos. Many times throughout this process I had to remind myself, as I’m sure many folks will do while watching the spot, that yes, this is real and this is happening.”The Inspiration4 commercial was created by Emmy Award-winning marketing agency Known, the agency of record for Shift4 Payments (FOUR) and Shift4Shop. The team that collaborated on the spot includes the Academy Award-winning crew from Industrial Light and Magic as well as Academy Award-winning Director of Photography John Schwartzman, whose credits include “Jurassic World,” “The Amazing Spider-Man,” and “Seabiscuit.”As announced earlier this week, the Inspiration4 mission will be commanded by Jared Isaacman, the 37-year-old founder and chief executive officer of Shift4 Payments (FOUR) and an accomplished pilot, philanthropist and adventurer. Shift4 Payments (FOUR) will be donating a crew seat to a deserving entrepreneur demonstrating innovation and ingenuity using the new Shift4Shop platform. Isaacman has committed to give $100 million to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and is inviting everyone to join him in attempting to raise upwards of $200 million or more in support of St. Jude’s multi-billion-dollar expansion aimed to accelerate research advancements and save more children worldwide.“The Inspiration4 mission gives us a historic opportunity to not only explore space but assembl",0.9994

762,GME represents a unique case. Normally with shorting the number of stocks in the market is enough to cover the short positions but the act of shorting creates fictitious shares. In theory the share could be borrowed an infinite amount of times. GME was shorted to the tune of 140% effectively creating more shares than actual exists. GME has a relatively small float of shares available in the market. The stock went up in price forcing the people who shorted the stock to cover but the retail traders were holding on to the stock forcing the market to find a price that would force the holders of the stock to sell. Hence why the retail investors say to the moon. I hope this helps.This will go down in history.,0.9835

GME likely will dwindle to $40 or so and find a support, then begin to trade like a normal stock, meaning up or down 2-3 percentage each trading day. This is already a very good scenario for GME. In the worst scenario, it will go back to around $20. The sheer stupidity is that the management never took the opportunity to issue shares which could be above $100 per share ... they did not have the guts to do that, you know why? Very simple, they know the business really, really not worth that, and worry about SEC action down the road if they do that.

As well as the the hedge funds are losing money each day because they’re stuck shorting the company. Once they start covering their short position the stock will skyrocket because they need to buy, which equals more demand. I personally bought more shares at this discount. Buy at your own risk.

Find the sheep for the wolves to prey upon. What you longs did was worse! Not only did you manipulate an already dying company, and herd the sheep to slaughter, but you gave the apple to the hedgefunds, let them take a bite, thus empowering them! And they'll make their billions back in no time! You made them that much wiser. The unfortunate ones are the ones you led astray from reality. Those are the ones that got hurt! And for what?? To get back at the shorts?? Someday you'll realize that to have a healthy market, you'll understand that the longs need the shorts, and the shorts need the longs! I swing trade the dips, and thank God for BOTH parties! We need volatility when trading! How boring and mundane would trading be if the markets rose and fell at a snails pace year after year?

I have read a few books about investing and still learning. I stated to my friends the best thing you can do is read a get informed. Do your due diligence. One friend responded I don’t like to read. So at the moment I saw GME I thought about buying one share. But i thought, it goes against my personal principles of investing which is long term horizon not short term gains. There is temptation. I think as Wareen Buffet said, you plant trees now for shade in the future. There is alway opportunity regardless of how the economy is. Like anything else, it takes time to learn or get a better understanding of a situation. I just hope that those who played GME and took a loss, take this as a learning opportunity to learn because I think in the long run you will become better and recognizing opportunity rather than follow hype.

1117,"The only squeeze happening now will be the Robinhood FOMO squeeze. The only reason it spiked from 17 to 400+ was mainly due to 140% having been shorted and shorts then 'needing' to cover when Reddit mass coordinated to bid it up to trigger and then not to sell. Hence 400. Curiously, it also involved the FOMO (fear of missing out) phenomenon, brought to you by Robinhood. The insiders thank you. Hope not too many got hurt and more were on the right side of the action but there're are no more shorts to squeeze, just each other's ballz. GME happens to be a company that's now losing money when profitable once. It's really worth no more than $5 a share, at most. It was only targeted because it 'had' an extraordinary short interest (covered and naked) of 140% (for good reason, it's a dying business model. All shorts just 'borrowed' shares that they immediately sold to bank the money with hope they'll be able to buy back the same amount of shares in the future at a cheaper price to pay back the loan (must be shares).Problem is, either the lender or the broker can demand this loan be repaid at any time or there's a margin call, since all shorts buy on margin. This esp happens when the pps spikes and the lenders now want to sell their shares now instead. That's why there's a squeeze. They're forced to cover (buy) at any price and if there're no sellers, what happens? $400+ happens and then the profit taking begins to lock them in. Hence $60 today on it's way back to 20. No broker will lend shares now, even at $60. Too volatile. But one could buy put options instead and pay the crazy insane premiums that are just not worth the risk.Bottom Line: It's a target rich environment out there and curtain has already closed on GME, AMC etc. The only curtain call will be the Maid Marion squeeze of Robinhood's nuts. Good luck with that. With her, you'll need it.",0.9905

I'm sure shorts are trying hard to break it lower but what they still don't realize is unless they stop shorting this and cover most of the shorts, this volatility won't stop. The only thing that's currently working for shorts is there's still remaining margin calls and whenever daytraders jump in and take profits it creates another short opportunity albeit just a day or two. So pick your entry point and exit point carefully and you can still make money using volatility. In the mean time I know lots of people still lost money on GME, so I can't really say ""take your profit and move to some other stock"" However, pay attention to MPLN around 2/12 for its earnings report.MPLN is one of those heavily shorted and manipulated stocks which was also aided by one of the most bogus Muddy Waters reports. It's trading around $8 and although Yahoo says 4.65% of outstanding shares are shorted, if you back out 76% of shares hold by insiders and institutions, 20% of floats, 32.33million to be exact, have been shorted.

A bunch of individual investors got hurt. Now hedge funds got hurt, too. At the end of the day, I am not too worried about these hedge fund guys. They are not mortgaging their futures on whether or not GameStop [stock] works or not. Individuals investors are.”To be sure, with the short position in GameStop way down versus January the upside momentum in the stock has severely subsided this week.GameStop shares were down a total of 70% from Monday to Tuesday heading into the start of Wednesday’s trading session. The stock rose slightly in Wednesday’s session on news the company hired several former Amazon executives to lead various business functions.But the damage to the super bullish trading story has been done. The stock has crashed some 81% from its intra-day all-time high on Jan. 28, according to Yahoo Finance Premium data. It’s likely the downside pressure persists as the company’s fundamentals come back into focus as the Reddit community seeks out a new target to jawbone higher.Warns Chukumba, “Here’s the scary thing. GameStop hit a high of over $480. Now it’s down to less than $100. Last we checked that stock is worth $10 a share. There’s still a lot of downside to go. I am thanking my lucky stars I made that decision [to drop coverage].”",0.8751
1184,"i didn't write this, but it's interesting to read!As you can see, most of things going on with GME right now are just MSM being paid to lure normies into selling their positions. For background, I work in one of the major finance companies, not on finance but with machine learning/time series prediction, but I've lots of meetings with lots of people, and people talk. I can't give away too much info because it may cost my job, but the deep #$%$ going on is over the charts, in 100 years this event will be spoken of.First of all, not all hedge funds shorted GME, this is important because of what is about to happen, some funds managers are actually selling the #$%$ of their wives and first born sons to banks to get loans, I'm speaking of exorbitant amounts, remember that 35% of the dollars ever printed were printed last year, guess who is going to get a big piece of that ? Why ? They want to be the bigger fish on the aquarium, WSB opened the door for few hedge funds to expand brutally by destroying others.Maybe people here didn't realize yet what they started, but it has epic proportions and you are living it right now. Second, big hedge funds are partnering up, but this is where comes the problem, imagine that you will try to rob a bank, what make you sure that the people that you partner with won't kill you to have less people to share the money with ? This is the current situation, this is the waiting, hedge funds, including the company that I work with are waiting for the money, and to see who they can trust.In the end they will all backstab each other, this is the finance industry, you can't deny it. Because soon as the price skyrocket to alpha centauri, guess who will be greedy to start another #$%$ up short ? Yes, the hedge funds, all over again, but is far easier to short at 750$, so is just a matter of who will short first. At work lots of people are absurdly greedy regarding shorting it, that was what created this opportunity, but some people never learn.This is why you should hold, I'm holding just for fun and to see this #$%$ show, if one day I sell, I will get the dollar bills and put in a frame in my wall, we are living the WW III of financial markets, now we are on the ships awaiting to arrive to the beach on a new D day, meanwhile some hedge funds are on our side (long, but don't think that they care about you as a person) coming with the atomic bombs. One risk that we escalated at work is that paper hands (as you like to call them) may sell leaving the other funds not vulnerable to a massive attack, rendering all this useless. Hold if you can, this is a game of patience, soon the direction will change, #$%$ huge buy orders will come and they will artificially inflate the price while other funds will have to think fast on get bankrup sooner, or be bankrupt later.Can't say much, but few funds already gave their CEOs and managers some quite fat bonuses, why ? This is the last song, last dance, they are looting the ship before it sinks. You have no reason to believe in me, I'm a random guy on the internet, but pay attention to the #$%$ events that are going on, and you will understand that this is much bigger than just making few bucks. If you put all of this together, you will see that the silence of operations (see the #$%$ low volume) means the silence before the storm. Wait to see the news of hedge fund managers hanging themselves.",0.9939

However then SHORTED again (at the $500 in after hours) before they Dumped the shares, and then caused the mass drop in price and the wave of ""paper hands"" to fold or triggered stop losses. I was caught in the laughter, and jokes, and euphoria for a few days, It was fun, I lost a few hundred bucks total.

And they unloaded a lot of their shares on us while we were trying to UPHOLD their stocks.$KOSS family/ company made about 45m or more from their shares sale during peak squeezes.I’m all for supporting a company, through fair pricing and upholding them.At what point should we stand back and really analyze the mechanics at play?During the peaks I remember GME CEO or someone had said he didn’t know anything about the ongoing “SQUEEZE”.If he had spoken on it or said “hold the line” or “I support retail investors” whatsoever, I’m pretty sure given they had offered shares for sale they could have been held liable for losses.",0.9903

They are owned by Goldman, Merrill, Citigroup, JP Morgan, ect. They work ""uncontrolled"" when it comes to naked short selling.

Steadily. Uptrending. Lower loWs,higher highs; no sight more beautiful.My interpretation? We found the bottom of the bearsattack. The news has been consistently saying thesqueeze is over but one and at time they are sayingtheir might be a second surge and their reasoning isif retailors see this price drop as a buying opportunityinstead of red flags, it will surely send the price up. Thelogic there is simple: if people are buying stock it goesup, if people are selling, it goes down.So today is pure magic. It doesnt need to be a wildswing up to be promising. What i it needs to be is slow,consistent buying pressure even during restrictedtrading.But all the shorts covered! Simply not true. That is a fact.All we know is what people are telling us. Melvin saysthey covered. It will be the third time they have claimedthat. Do I think they covered? Yes, I do.

He plead guilty in 1999 to running an illegal “pump and dump” stock scheme that cost his clients more than $100 million. Belfort served 22 months in federal prison and later authored a memoir, “The Wolf of Wall Street,” which became a film starring Leonardo DiCaprio.GameStop shares soared more than 1,600%, in three months, hitting $483 last week and that surprised Belfort. “When I first looked at it I said, ‘Yeah, it's a modified pump and dump,’” he said.Individual stock pickers used Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum to martial an army of retail investors. They used platforms, like Robinhood, to trade up the price of GameStop stock squeezing short sellers like Melvin Capital, which lost billions of dollars.“What the small investors were able to do here is shocking,” Belfort pointed out. “It deserves an applause.”Belfort went on to defend the retail investors, “I don't think it's illegal, because most of them by the way, if you actually go through the message boards they just like, they love the stock. They’re just having fun and they want to kind of stick it to the man more than anything.”",0.8776

A Reuters dispatch to The Globe says that gold prices have dipped from last year's record highs above $2,000 an ounce as investors turn to stocks that do well in times of economic growth. Short trades as a percentage of total traded volume for Barrick rose to 24.8 per cent for the second half of last month, from 14.9 per cent for the first half of December. Newmont saw an increase to 11.4 per cent from 8.8 per cent over the same period, while trades in Kinross rose to 20.6 per cent, from 18.2 per cent, according Reuters data. Hedge funds typically engage in the practice of short selling by borrowing a stock from an institutional investor, such as a pension fund, and selling it back at a lower price when shares fall, pocketing the difference. Tougher lockdown restrictions to combat a new variant of the virus and huge government debt nonetheless could propel gold higher. Short bets against miners Yamana fell to 17.7 per cent, from 25.7 per cent, while the number for Alamos fell to 19.5 per cent from 21.9 per cent. 2021 Canjex Publishing Ltd.

Because with Robinhood and the others, they are still limiting the amount of shares that people can buy. People are either getting into different plays or opening up a new brokerage account which takes 3-5 business days for the funds to be deposited. But I think there maybe one more push for $AMC and $GME in the next couple of days. When the hedge funds ease up and are a sleep that is when the people will attack. I maybe wrong, but that is just my opinion.

It's over!Wrong.No one is selling at these prices. Sure, maybe a few scared folk who don't know any better. Maybe they trigger a few stop losses. Maybe some margins get called. But it's not enough. Say it with me:*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*>WHAT?!You heard me. 30cent GME? No problem.They don't need a low price, they need your shares. If 10 people sell at 30c cents, and that's the only market activity, it's a ""30 cent stock"" but Melvin only netted ten shares. They are still #$%$ *They aren't buying 50 million shares at 30c, nor $100, nor $300, and that's their problem.* It's an availability issue. Sometimes it's ALSO a price issue (too high for them) but primarily it's the availability.All the activity driving down the listed share price are *illegal ladder attacks* (not that legality should be expected at this point, these folk are crooks). Those aren't actual sales though, it's just shares trading hands from hedgie to hedgie. They aren't gobbling up value. These people don't admit defeat, they are neither smart nor humble, they are crooks. They need 50 million+ shares. They need over 100% of the float to sell to them (that 50% float you hear about is accounting shennaigans, ignore it, they are still exposed). *You can NOT close that many positions sniping a few shaky handed noobs.* We aren't talking about a few shares they need to buy, we're talking about #$%$ ALL OF THEM.I'll explain that in a second, but first let me repeat:*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*So let's say you want to buy 50 million shares, let's look at what shares are being asked for in my hypothetical example market:**# of Shares - Price**x 20 - $0.30cx 80 - $5x 400 - $20x 600 - $40x 900 - $60x 2,000 - $100x 5,000 - $150x 10,000 - $200x 30,000 - $300x 50,000 - $400x 150,000 - $500x 1 mil - $1,000x 15 mil - $5,000x 30 mil - $69,420Get it? There are only a few people willing to sell at those low prices. By the time you've bought a quarter million shares (0.5% of what you need to buy) you're back up to the sustained highs. And these are just exaggerations to make a point. *A stock price only reflects current trade values, not availability at those prices*. If the hedgies are trading their shares back and forth to each other to drive down the price and they have ladder attacked down to a Nickel, that doesn't mean anyone's shares are only worth pocket change, that just means that that is what things are trading at in the moment. There's no volume to buy up at those costs. No one can force you to sell at a Nickel.Get it?*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*They need our shares, not a low price. The price does not reflect whether we are 'winning' or not. Their financial reserves indicate that, but there isn't a ticker for that. But be sure, every day the inevitable closes in. Sell out of fear if you like, but you'll just miss out in the end.

This is the best advice one can give. Those insisting to hold are trying to keep people in the stock in hopes the small spikes up would manipulate new buyers to buy in to raise the stock value up so people could cash out. In theory that is the way to do it but pull out a calculator and calculate the market cap of this stock last I checked 6 billion and what kind of buyers/sold shares you would need for this stock to move up drastically. After solving that equation I’m sure you’ll also see what the “sell suggestion” group of people see. I bought this stock last week and dumped it last week and managed to come out with a profit but like Jimmy Chill tweeted “the ’s always win” remember your in this to make money you holding the bag and showing loyalty to people you don’t know was never the plan... look into the nakd stock who knows maybe some will recover a good chunk of money it’s on a dip I’m sure many can afford a good chunk of shares so when it even goes up a mere .30 it’ll make a big difference. #daytrading101 I’m also apart of Jim Cramers subscription chat and earlier today after mad money this stock along with Super Bowl stocks were a topic of discussion.",0.9948

3108,"Hi everyone,As a reminder, investors who buy more than 3.5mm shares of stock are legally required to file a form 13D within 10 calendar days of purchasing stock.I believe the position must also disclose whether this is a trading position or whether you intend to be an activist-- I believe this is under Purpose of the Transaction.1.) Purchasing a stock because you feel it's undervalued, or even for a proxy battle, is perfectly legal, moral, ethical, and compliant.2.) One thing I can guarantee is that unless retail longs stand up for these guys, they are going to get hauled off to some sort of Senate or House investigation. Now, to be sure, they have 3-4 minutes of questions to answer. But the people who *really* have the questions to answer are the shorts.3.) One thing that will be interesting on the Form 13Ds is how much stock actually got bought? Are these in cash accounts? Who has custody? 4.) If this percentage ownership is substantial, it would be in the best interests of the owners to consolidate as a control group, even if they all bought individually. 5.) The good news is that if these 13Ds get filed a couple days early, they can still make the original 10-day deadline for control group status, just in case there are any questions whatsoever about whether this is coordinated. ""We're required to file within 10 days anyways; we didn't coordinate, but it made sense to consolidate our holdings once we figured out who the other buyers were. Regardless, Senator, the question is moot, since we could have waited the full 10 days anyways.""6.) If these questions start to get too ruthless, it is time for the rest of the Country to figure out why. What is really behind this? Why is it that a bunch of investors see the deal of the lifetime, buy X% of the stock, HOLD THE STOCK, sit on losses in the stock, and THEY are the ones under investigation, not the people who sold more than 100% of the float. What the heck is going on?Something about this market doesn't make sense to me, but it seems to be on the short side with margined positions, rather than cash longs. We'll have to see what the market clearing condition is in the next two weeks with any 13Ds that come out. It *is* going to be important to be extremely compliant with the 13D requirements. But if you have $350mm to throw at a stock, you've probably got terrific lawyers, including the provision of highly conservative advice getting into this transaction.My guess is that the legislators and regulators will either do the right thing and investigate the bad guy shorts, or they will stand down on this one. A few questions are reasonable for the buyers, but this is capitalism, and if you short a stock into the ground, other people have a right to disagree with you, say it's a good deal, and buy it.And I'm still wondering why the market clearing condition seems broken here unless everyone who bought at $350 saying diamond hands just sold. I still own most of my stock, and I'm happy to ride this elevator down to zero, where I can just buy more. I guess if it gets to $0.01, I'll have to file a 13D at some point, too.",0.9984

3157,"Tl;dr We're going to $800 but only because the hedges planned it and our minor gains are just the tips they're giving us for being used.Okay this is just a crazy conspiracy theory spinning in my head since I started looking into GME this year.I'm fairly new to investing but something about this whole ordeal feel planned. Feel free to correct me on anything, I feel like I only have a very basic surface understanding of this.The most suspicious thing to me is how all this started. So DFV and WSB basically found that Melvin had overshorted GameStop through filings, which is odd given an experienced hedge fund should know better and trade OTC on their shorts. This set off a buying frenzy that drove the prices up to almost $500 at which point with Robinhood shutting down buys cut the momentum instantly. I imagine hedges piled on shorts probably even more excessively than what they had originally shorted and then set off the ladder attacks to drive prices down and will cover their shorts when they feel like they've hit the lowest price.However there's still the shorts placed at the beginning of this play that needs to be covered along with a horde building on WSB looking to drive up the price so they can get themselves out of the high entering prices due to FOMO. BlackRock bought shares as the facilitator to ensure hedges can borrow those to short.To maximize gains, the hedges, after driving down the prices close to their original shorts, can put long positions at the bottom of the price will and then cover all of their original shorts simultaneously, giving everyone the moonshot they were waiting for.Looking at the $800 sweeps placed, I imagine this is where they see the price will be by the time everyone starts to sell. At this point, before dumping their long positions they can do another massive short again. This way they absolutely maximize their gains and utilize WSB to help them do it. After the current low prices, a shot to $800 would satisfy most retail investors who cash out in time around the $800 point with the hedges with a nice handful of tendies. The hedges can also report using the media that they saved the retail investors and are actually the heroes of this story. After taking in profits, most retail investors would probably agree and this saves their image and protect them from any political fall out. It may also provide a boost to the market as the hedges will have quite a bit to reinvest once their three plays are done.Citadel and Point72 probably is aware which is why they invested billions Melvin when it looked like it Melvin was going under. It makes no sense to make such an investment into Melvin at that point (no, being a former boss doesn't mean they should give you billions to loose), unless they were aware of the potential plan Melvin had coming out of it.Those who hold on past 800 too long will probably go bust and GME may actually get shorted/sold into bankruptcy by the end and prove the hedges right at the beginning.In any case this is part of the reason why I'm holding on, while I was #$%$ at the blatant manipulation, I took a moment to think of this situation from the hedge fund perspective and since their main priority should be to maximize gains, this play makes a lot of sense, they also get to appear to save the little guys. It honestly would surprise me if the higher levels of government were informed of the play too, this has the potential to provide something much larger than a stimulus cheque to boost the economy, and the reinvested gains will also be a nice shot in the markets arm. It would also explain why the government hasn't do anything real to halt them or WSB. If WSB really did take down Melvin, small as they are on the scale of hedge funds, it would still affect the market negatively for a little while. If this all plays out, almost everyone wins, except GME and diamond hands that lasted bit too long.We're getting our moonshot but only because we're playing according to their plans.",0.9992

Time to close out the GME""Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a #$%$ you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.That then accelerates the selling.Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particularSo what to do ?If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street",0.993

Imagine a situation where at least half the sub buys at least one stock in the same day guess what happens the couple of hundred of shares in the short ladder attack don't matter anymore and due to the low float we could easily see a price increase of over 200% in a single day which will inevitably cause some paper hand shorts to cover causing the short squeeze 2.0. the key here is on the same DAY but what day should we buy on what day would cause the most amount of damage with least amount buys the answer is on Wednesday why, that's simple because there can literally be no more shorting today due to the Nasdaq short sale restrictions, and as long as our buy volume is high enough we can easily start Short Squeeze 2.0.TLDR; we all need to buy today while no new shorts can be opened, the low float can easily cause GME to double or triple in a single day causing Short squeeze 2.0",0.9517

3323,"To both shorts and longs. Be very careful about what short information you read on the internet at the moment. I spent lots of time doing due diligence and I strongly believe you folks have been duped on both sides... its really quite sick.First thing, no actual short information is published. Not since Wednesday last week. Encourage you to look into why that is, not going to explain it.S3 Partners is a datalake provider that pulls together lots of information about market comings and goings. This is the one that all the media sources are publishing based on. Be aware that they changed how they calculate short interest to account for synthetic shorts. They did so without disclosing it until they got lots of attention on social media about it. The news media sources did not pass this change in calculation along and as a result they have published effectively a doctored state of affairs for the stock. Its shady as hell. A short squeeze as we know it is not coming. Not just yet. The reason is that there is no major positions short despite it being such a large number across a single holder anymore. The stock will rise though because the WSB community has grown substantially. They will continue to buy the stock until eventually a critical mass in it to cause enough float to be removed from circulation that volatility returns. This is evident in the spreads of the order book in the last day of trading and especially in after hours trading. I encourage you to really think about the news sources you are making your trades upon. I will disclose that I am long on this stock, but honestly, i almost sold today until i spent 5 hours reviewing all the data and sources I could find.",0.808

3437,REPOST about AMC  Here I will lay it out for you......They had until Friday to close below $8.63. They didn't do it. We closed at 13. Which means we won. The next part is now they have this week to cover those contracts. Which means they have to buy them until Friday at the latest. Some of those they have to buy by Wednesday. Apparently you guys dont understand how options contracts work. They closed out of the money on Friday now they have the next several days to fulfill their contracts and going to repurchase their shares to return to their lender. Do you think they're going to purchase them all right now? Obv. not...That guarantees them a loss. They're going to try everything they can to push the price down between now and that time they have to repay. In the meantime the clock is ticking. The longer we can keep the price trading sideways the more they get squeezed at the end of the week and price starts going up as they inevitably have to start buying. They're just trying to buy themselves time. This was never going to the moon Monday. It was going to trade sideways as its a battle between US and THEM. The clock is ticking on them not us. All we have to do is keep it sideways for the next couple of days by buying and holding. NOT SELLING.

This is not short selling - it's simply selling an insanely over inflated stock!",0.1022
3591,"There seems to be so much confusion about short selling and short interest.1. Short selling in its nature is basically margin betting. It is the borrowing of shares from longs without the longs knowing. 2. Brokerages are the mechanism through which shorting happens. They set a margin for the borrower for each stock. The margin is what the hedgefunds are scared of not interest, they can afford the interest, the margin can kill them, also stopping their ability to play other stocks. The more margined they get, the quicker they need to get out of the trade.3. Current short interest is unknowable, by no one, period. All the numbers being thrown around are wrong. Short sells are reported on a regular basis to the SEC, the SEC publishes them, each fund reports their own numbers but individuals traders don't have to. So even that number is not accurate.4. The companies that claim to give you short data are fos, it is just what they compile from a few reports and their best guess, it's meaningless, especially in a nked short. Do not waste your money on it.5. If the current short interest was live, the market would break. There would be no point in shorting. 6. Currently, the Bberg terminal shows a short interest of 89%. But again, that is their calculation and best guess through their algorithm of what happened volume/time since the lest report. It is not accurate. 7. In a nked short, most of these calculations and guesses also go out the window. At this point, all we know is that the stock was heavily shorted through ladders at the first half of the week, it is obvious in the chart so there is a possibility that the shorts have doubled down, its a common strategy they use.8. If they doubled down, it explains why the price ran so low, this gives them an opportunity to cover their current short and some of their original short in hopes of bringing down the magnitude of the inevitable squeeze.",-0.9463

I think it coming back very strongly. Now if wallstreet give parity to other eCommerce company with $1.35B sale and assume just 50% growth ( they have 309%), it would trade atleast 20 time revenue = $27b which is above all time high they just have.Let's assume it's only 20% sustain eCommerce growth, it would still trade 7-8 time revenue which is $10B+",0.9645

That's because when they are finished playing a game they can sell it, or trade with friends -- an option not available to them with a digital copy. Catering to this crowd, GameStop offers trade-ins and used games for purchase. This allows hardcore gamers an opportunity to recoup some of their purchase price for video games, and allows others the option to buy used games at prices discounted from the retail versions. At the moment, digital games typically sell for the same retail price as their physical counterparts. For game enthusiasts, the physical copy is still the better option, and therein lies the undeniable advantage that GameStop currently has.",0.9773

A picture he posted last week on the Reddit WallStreetBets forum showed his GameStop investment was worth $48 million, though his actual returns could not be independently verified.But Mr. Gill’s former employer, MassMutual, has told securities regulators in Massachusetts that it was unaware that Mr. Gill had spent more than a year posting about GameStop on social media, online message boards and YouTube. The insurer also told regulators that had it known about Mr. Gill’s outside activities, it would have asked him to stop or possibly fired him. …The Massachusetts regulator is investigating whether Mr. Gill or MassMutual broke any rules.""https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-04/elon-musk-s-gamestop-tweets-are-now-a-hedge-fund-signal?srnd=premium",0.9844

3973,"What people don't understand is this kind of phenom doesn't die in a day. Especially if there are still 40% of shorts out there. Many paid bashers here are trying to create fear to drag the price down but think twice if you haven't covered your shorts yet or even were able to build new short position. GME is more than likely to see $80 ~100 before it goes below $40 if ever, unless they totally screw up in executing its biz plan... but it seems less likely since it looks like they are hiring right guys left and right.What I can tell you is GME has bottomed out AH, or possibly Friday morning unless it gaps up....for many reasons...still tons of shorts, trading limit has been lifted overnight, if Yellen/regulators try to come up with any kind of solution, it will be more toward limiting short side.And if you get rid of those last few days of above $150 range, GME is just one of those 1000 hyped stocks out there. Valuation? Currently 90% of stocks out there are overvalued.At least GME is not even trading @1x revenue under $80..... In a way GME is a bargain.Disclaimer..I started buying AH $50at and intends to buy more if it dips more and will sell above $75Now the market doesn't care what I say here. The only reason that I post is to share my 2 cents and hopefully it helps other individual investors like me to make money if I spot good long idea or not to lose money before they sell their shares on pull back out of fear and lose money.I never do momentum trading.

Time to close out the GME""Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a #$%$ you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.That then accelerates the selling.Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particularSo what to do ?If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.""https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey_everyone_its_mark_cuban_jumping_on_to_do_an/glqidn6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3",0.9932

A detailed market summary.Popular opinion says the oil market is dead.In 2001 popular opinion was that the tech sector was dead.In 2009 popular opinion was that the banking and housing industries were dead.You make money when others are wrong. That’s where you find true value.The truth is that oil was hurt by COVID19. The lockdowns hurt demand by 5 million barrels per day. However, since April 2020, oil demand has recovered to 96 million barrels per day - from its 2019 high of 100 million barrels per day.The price has recovered to almost $60 a barrel.As the world goes green, oil demand is expected to continue to rise by 2% annually through 2050 - this is projected by green energy companies.The combination of anti-drilling policies and rising demand creates the perfect Bull Market scenario for oil. By 2023 oil will be $100 per barrel and will range between $100-$150 per barrel through 2050.The cash generated by the high prices will be used by the oil companies to develop better green tech and to buy out existing green competitors. It ensures their continued survival.Today you can buy many high quality companies at a huge discount to true value and get real income with their quarterly distributions.Examples include $ET for $6; $OXY for $22; $GEL for $6 and the $XLE ETF for $42.",0.7928

I was a lurker for years but long story short, I had about 20k that I had saved primarily from my hubby of buying and selling silver and gold. Long story short.. These were my positions:1162 shares purchase @ $4.72-Totaling $5461.40 ----- Sold 500 @ $342 Totaling = $171,00020 -26Jan $4.50C - Totaling roughly $2480.00 -------- Sold @ $4676 Toaling = $813,500Total RETURN $984,000!!!!!!Keep in mind, this is the first time that I had every bought a call option. I essentially had to watch youtube videos to even learn how to adjust my settings in my account to allow it. This journy has been simply amazing. All this started from me selling my 2004 Suzuki Kata for 10K.I still have 662 shares as a token and reminder of the chance I took to churn a profit and this has been life saving.

If it is still over 100% shorted, then that means the squeeze can still happen and will probably happen when everyone sees that short float stat & starts buying in. Until then there is no point of selling if you bought at the top. Why would you sell at an 80% loss if you’re only getting 10% back? Just wait and see how things play out. If the short float is still 100% on the 9th and food news about the company comes out as well by that time we could see a massive spike.

4465,"A lot of good, well-meaning folks, retail investors that got carried away in the WSB Reddit trading started buying call options without fully understanding what options are or some of the legal consequences of options expiration. A customer who buys 1 call option (a 'contract' ) purchases the right to buy 100 shares at a certain agreed-upon price (the 'strike price,' or simply the 'strike') until the time of expiration (the 'expiration date.') What they may not realize is that if the share price is ABOVE the strike price at the time of expiration AND THEY DO NOTHING, the brokerage will BY LAW, AUTOMATICALLY exercise the option for the customer – meaning that it will buy 100 shares at the strike price FOR EACH OPTION CONTRACT that he/she owns, even if the customer does nothing, charged to the customer's account.Say a trader got carried away trying to 'stick it to the man' and bought 100 call options. Say then the stock soared above the strike price (becoming an 'in-the-money' call option or simply ITM calls as they're acronymed). Then, if the purchaser doesn't sell these call options for a profit BEFORE they expire, without other instructions from the customer, the brokerage would by law have to EXERCISE ALL 100 OPTIONS CONTRACTS, or100 times 100 = 10,000 shares of GME at, say, a strike price of $240 per share, equals a $2,400,000 GME stock purchase!A lot of people didn't know what to do at the time of expiration, so they did NOTHING.They woke the next day to find they had a HUGE MARGIN CALL- more than many times the value of their home, because they had just 'purchased' a huge number of GME shares even though they had no idea that it was going to happen.That's why there were a lot of people on the financial networks saying that it was was going to 'end in tears,' and I feel really bad for those people.

I encourage people who lost precious money not to get depressed, you learned very important lessons which I learned myself many years ago:If you want to ride the hype, do it as early as possible and sell in the first signs of weakness.If you invest in stocks, invest in good companies with good business performance, and stay long (diamond hands). Allocate only small amount of your funds to adventures like this.By all mean, this is not a trading recommendation, this is just what I learned myself during the years.Sorry for being a ""boomer"" (Boomers are just millennials with more life experience)",0.9308

4685,"A quote from WSB by somebody who tells it like it is:""When I joined this subreddit last week, among hundreds (maybe thousands) of posts I read here and definitely many thousands of comments, I didn’t encounter one post or one comment saying “I will take profits”. I saw 100% of posts saying “I will hold” until $X. That X was above $1,000 in each and every post.So, as far as I’m concerned, this was supposed to be a group effort to squeeze the hedge funds. I never knew this was a bunch of individual traders acting in his/her own interest. Those who sold at $300 or above on the way up or on the way down should have been honest about what they were going to do. But, they took advantage of those who believed in the cause. In fact, I’m sure most of them made posts here about apes with diamond hands just to goad the new comers into buying at insane prices because “everyone was going to hold” until the epic squeeze was induced.Nothing new here. That’s how humans act. Animals are much more trustworthy. When a pack of wolves hunt a large animal, they act together until they corner it and kill it for the benefit of every one who takes part in the endeavor even at the risk of being killed. Humans betray others at the first opportune moment.I stand to lose about $5000 if GME goes to $2. I didn’t lose this money to hedge funds. The money was stolen from me by the WSB members who engineered the runup in $GME by getting millions of people to buy into the ruse of an epic squeeze. These thieves knew all along that they would dump their shares upon the new buyers at the top of the hype they engineered.It’s not a pleasant feeling, but it’s not the end of the world for me. I would never have gambled that much, so it was a moment of weakness for me when I decided to trust in the goodness of humanity. I had never allowed that to happen to me before WSB, and it will never happen again. I knew better, so believing in the goodness of the people was a temporary lapse of judgment, probably induced by a certain degree of the COVID-19 related mental fatigue.""",0.88

The possible price decline is expected to be between -6.6% and -14%.- The level of volatility suggests that AAL’s share price declined -6.6% (based on the closing price of the week) or as much as 9.3%(the lowest price AAL shares were traded) in the following week after the Q2 earnings. AAL's share price dropped -8.7%(based on the closing price of the week) or as much as -14%(the lowest price AAL shares were traded) after the Q3 earnings.""So they all came out true.I had written weekly and biweekly covered calls on my all AAL long position. I didn't want to lose the stocks but it's in a way nice to know that I am able kept the premiums and the shares for the weekly calls. The next week's covered calls are insured for just over $19. Based on the trend in the previous two quarters, the stock price may start gaining momentum either towards to end of next week or early in the following week. Hopefully, I'll keep the other shares before the stock price gains momentum.Meanwhile $GME short put I have written on Tuesday has given me a little scare but it is nice to know the $GME stock price is way up today.

But today I bought GME. WHY? Because I did research and saw this is unique for sure. Since this whole thing was shorted over 100% they haven't bought back all the shares they need. They still paying millions on interest for the borrowed share. They really try to lower the price artificially. No Robin Hood isn't an evil part of the game, they just caught up by margin problems. But it helps to keep the price low. The users shifting to other platforms now to buy. In this constellation and with enough buyers (only a few knowing what they are doing) this actually really could make history as the biggest short squeeze since Volkswagen. Check it out, the path there was similar. But this could be Volkswagen on steroids. I went in with 1000 shares, knowing it can be a total loss but there is a real chance of taking part in this unique happening. It's not over.

When these same organizations get one upped by young folks and then we allow every organization to pile in on them to “have technical errors to not recognize trading symbols to have you call customer support with no one answering” as Charles Schwab and many others did— while this was being done and this ladder short was allowed to go on then when the stock was going up the technical issues went away and you could buy once more but don’t buy too much because trading will be halted. Isn’t it interesting it’s only halted going up but not down?? To many this is just stupid kids who don’t know what they are doing but to many such as myself it exposed just how corrupt and rigged the system is... you want to say that wallstreetbets is that blame but how in the world could you and would you short more stocks than what is available.... someone made a horrible blunder that’s where this blame needs to be placed.

Now, there are some exceptions such as GME but the risk is much higher. You could have made money on the way up if you bought earlier enough and was smart enough to cash out so that it’s a realized gain.

But when you have a group of redditers with the only emotion of greed you will see a stock like GME or AMC fly up. That’s how powerful the internet is.

This all about supply and demand. Why are brokers taking hours to fill orders and why are some of them limiting shares? Do you really believe that it’s the clearing firm that holding them back or is it the billionaire shorts that are making the brokers think that this is just the mechanics of the market. OPEN YOUR EYES. We all need to fight for what is right! Shorting needs to stop. Why should people be allowed to borrow shares that you paid for and make a profit off of it?

5867,"Today was a victory.The stock survived dropping below $5 which I speculate is around the level the HF need to get it to.Remember also there is gonna be less support for $AMC until the main body of WSB are done with $GME.Yet we are still here.I was actually expecting a day like this, and hoping it would happen on a green day. Because if you noticed the message that this sub and others have been promoting the last few days has been to participate responsibly.I would rather suffer a red day and know that my fellow AMC holders dont have their lives on the line than have anyone crash out and get burnt.So today is exactly what I would imagine it would look like if WSB AMC holders were to take the chance to make themselves safe on the spike and then come back in with what they can afford to lose in the afternoon.I was happy to see the focus turn to that, but wondered how we would know when it was happening. Well I think it would look like today..Let me tell you why this is a good thing and if we keep on doing this we wont even need the GME holders..1.) It seems like a lot of people are over exposed on AMC. This is the biggest threat to the long term survival of this group.The mods have been correctly telling people to make themselves safe and that is what we must do on every green day. Because as new AMC shareholders join this group hopefully they wont get caught in the hype and end up in the same position.. So regular warnings and guidelines will stop new members being at risk which helps us all in the long run.2.) The current shareholders who are at risk I think will be following a pattern like we saw today. They jump out on the spike then come back in the afternoon with a smaller stake..And can sleep at night.WE NEED TO CONTINUE WITH THIS PATTERNSo all of the AMC holders at risk at $6 dollars would jump off then. Then once those paper hands have gotten themselves out of trouble they then come back in for the long run on a smaller stake.We should expect these patterns on green days when we hit each share price.So I think what we saw today were the $8 paper hands leaving.. And then coming back in the afternoon.So now they are gone, and hopefully finding their way back to us, we can expect the share price to move up to $9 before we start to see paper hands again. Thats if im right.Then we will see this pattern each time we hit $10, $11 etc we should expect this especially when confidence is not so high. Until most of the AMC holders are safe.Thats when AMC holders can really activate their superpower of turning paper hands into diamond hands.The key to the WSB AMC holders sucess is not just liking the stock. But for other people to find out whats going on and decide they like it too. And if people see whats taking place with the short ladder attacks and see what it means for us all, then I think we should be able to generate enough growth to be able to recover from the members re positioning themselves financially.EDIT:This is how I think we do that;1.) Explain to them that the HF's are manipulating the markets to push prices below say $5. (We dont know what it is). And that they should get shares when they are doing that as they will be cheaper than usual.2.) When we know that the shorting restiction is in place (I guess we will know on Monday) we then tell them that because there is no HF manipulating the stocks we expect they will have a green day.. That the price will grow until they do it again and that this is the cycle that will continue until the HF's run up too much debt trying to push the price down.3.) When the HF's run out of time and pull out of the market, the price will spring back up when it squeezes. When that happens they have a chance at becoming a millionare. Explain to them that we dont care about the price. We wait for spikes and the squeeze but we are waiting out the HF's. And they cant wait forever..And we like the stock!That will be enough for most people to get whats going on.. And if they are only spending what they can afford. Then they will have fun.All the mods and us have to do is keep telling people NOT to spend more than they can afford. And as that message goes through the ranks of buyers we need to respect that is what they will do first chance if they need to.It means that every time we do this on a green day, our next green day after that will be stronger.And as long as people can spare some extra $$ and r/amcstock grows, we can expect to see less paper hands each day..But crucially.. Most members will be short ladder attack proof.After that if you can keep buying and the sub grows with new shareholders I estimate in a few weeks no one whould be phased by ladder attacks. In fact no one here will care about the price.We will only check the price to see when there is a big spike or the squeeze. Sure when confidence is high people will want to hold anyway.. But for people with bills to pay who thought this was goin",0.9992

5877,"Here is the deal.. GME rally had a reason for it.. a massive short squeeze.. Michael Bury (Big Short guy) did not invest in this back when it was at $4 because he liked the fundamentals of the company.. He realized correctly that the stock is oversold largely due to heavy shorting & his hypothesis was that a massive short squeeze will lift the stock to a much higher number.. Which is what happened.. Now the short interest is still high but not as high it was before.. The business fundamentals may have changed a little bit due to this rally.. maybe some investors will want to buy games physically from the store rather than download it digitally just to support the business.. But I dont think enough people will do that..SO if you are sitting here today thinking this could rally more and back to $300 and somehow GME is a good stock, you will probably be proven wrong.. Lot of shorts have learnt a hard lesson & they will dare not short this again to the extent they did before.. If they do, they will probably protect themselves in a way that they dont have to cover their shorts in urgency.. which takes the risk of a short squeeze away.. Remember that in its heyday before digital downloads became common place, when the company made close to a $1b EBITDA, GME was a $50 stock..Its business environment has gotten only worse since then! So my advise is to cut your losses and save yourself some cash.. Always remember that 50-60% loss is better than 70-80% loss.. The reddit battle has been won already by the retail traders..

6045,"Congratulations to those who held and forced a squeeze. Excellent job. I have been trading since the 90’s and nearly every message board for various stocks, through the years has been filled with traders urging others to hold and buy more to force a squeeze, but they never succeeded. You are the first. It’s funny that some are big Wall Street players are now talking of investigating this yet they have ignored, and are likely responsible, for all the naked shorts over the years in numerous stocks, not to mention the massive manipulation that has been occurring in the silver market. If a squeeze can be started in silver, as I read is being attempted, it would make a game stop run look tiny, just because how much silver is manipulated. It of course will be much harder to squeeze silver, you just can’t buy up the miners or the etfs, given the manipulation is done through the false paper contracts, so the only way to squeeze is to buy up silver itself and take delivery. It would be a huge undertaking. Although the GME squeeze was excellent, the alleged sequel of AMC was not a good choice. The newly entered convertible debenture trumped any squeeze, as while you were buying up shares the lender was dumping new shares into the market. I wouldn’t be surprised if the AMC sequel wasn’t planned by the lenders to assist them in making a profit on their loan by an increased share price; as opposed to the GME crowd. After all the GME squeeze hadn’t finished yet, so why start a sequel. Then it appeared various sub groups tried to squeeze the other top 10 heavily shorted stocks but too many stocks were trying to be squeezed at the same time, compounded by the failure of the AMC squeeze because of the convertible debenture and as GME hadn’t finished yet, doomed these attempts as there wasn’t one stock to focus on like GME.I’m curious to see what will be the next short squeeze candidate. My thoughts is BGS would be a great candidate as it’s a profitable food company (they make such brands as Green Giant, Crisco, Skinny Girl, Ortega, etc),with a 5% dividend and 37% short. It’s being shorted heavily as the big boys claim they are over leveraged as they borrowed to buy additional establish food brands to add to their portfolio. This over leverage argument has been made for years and is weak. These shorts have been making his argument of over leverage for years while suppressing the share price; meanwhile the longs, whose shares were artificially kept low by these shorts, would continue to get their hefty dividend; the company’s sales increased, especially since the pandemic as people are cooking more at home; and borrowing costs for the company have been and will remain cheap and thus the argument made by shorts aren’t supported by the facts yet they continue to manipulate the stock price by their shorts. The float is smaller than GME (although not as low as a covid vaccine stock that I like, CAPR, whose share price is under 7 and it has only 20 million shares, which is 1/3 the amount of a GME and BGS, but I digress). BGS looks like a great candidate for a short squeeze as it’s a solid business, with a great dividend, low float, and a high short position.",0.9985

According to the Wall Street Journal, Senvest Management's flagship equity fund, which began buying GameStop shares in September, has seen its assets under Management soar by $700 million to $2.4 billion from $1.6 billion at the end of 2020 as the stock price soared from less than $10 to more than $400.

They can't just wipe out their short volume without buying back shares. There is a big problem. If retail investors aren't selling and keep buying they need to pay the price that we ask for. Data shows there should be a huge amount shares to be covered. So what's their plan?Distribute Hedge Funds debts to other investment firms and retail shorts. How?1.Create a downwards trend by manipulating the market. Get retail investors to think its going down to $50 and let them short. Buy all shares from retail shorts.2. There will be panic sellers / Early profit takers etc. When they all sell Buy using market orders to cover short minimise the short position.2. Now the price is at the bottom, So what will happen to $500-$800 Call options? They will go down. So loaded up more call options to cover your short position losses because you know when you cover your short position share price will go up.4. Start covering short position in premarket when the volumes is low so the price will go up. Yes Hedge funds will be paying big money for the share at loss but they will be making more money on upward trend using call options anyway. 5. Remove restrictions on Robinhood and in other platforms so buyers and buy the stock and pump this up while covering there short position.
