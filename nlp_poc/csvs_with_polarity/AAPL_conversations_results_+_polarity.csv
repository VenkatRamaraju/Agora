22,"Apple's iPhone 12 sales exceed Wedbush's 'bull case scenario,' expected to boost stockSales of Apple Inc.'s iPhone 12 have exceeded Wedbush's ""bull case scenario"" for fiscal 2021, based on Asia supply chain checks, and should boost shares with December results coming shortly, analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note Thursday. ""We believe Apple saw a robust Christmas/holiday season not just on iPhones, but also had a strong AirPods performance that will be another product tailwind heading into 2021 for Cook & Co,"" Ives wrote. Asia checks suggest the supply chain is expecting low to mid 90 million iPhone unit builds for the quarter, comfortably ahead of the 80 million to mid 80s range expected in mid December, 75 million expected in late October and 65 million to 70 million range expected three months ago, he wrote. ""This is roughly a 35% increase from our original and Street forecasts. For the March quarter we believe builds for total iPhones ticked up again another 5% over the last week and are now in the 60 million to 70 million range. For the June quarter we believe initial builds are in the low 40 million range with potentially an upward bias. We have not seen a launch uptrend such as this in a number of years for Apple and the only iPhone trajectory similar would be the iPhone 6 in 2014 based on our analysis,"" said Ives. The Wall Street consensus is for 217 million iPhone unit sales in fiscal 2021, but Wedbush sees potential for up to 240 million units, ""which would easily eclipse the previous Apple record of 231 million units sold in FY15. Importantly, with our estimation that 350 million of 950 million iPhones worldwide are currently in the window of an upgrade opportunity, we believe this will translate into an unprecedented upgrade cycle for Cook & Co.,"" said Ives. Wedbush rates Apple as outperform with a $160 12-month price target and a bull case target of $200. Apple shares were up 0.5% premarket and have gained 82% in 2020, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.24% has gained 6.6% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.13% has gained 15.5%.",0.9979

(AAPL)By: Clark Schultz, SA News Editor1 CommentHyundai Motor (OTCPK:HYMLF) is up more than 20% in Seoul trading after the company confirmed that it is in early stage talks with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) about working together to develop a self-driving car, without any firm plan in place yet.Reports suggest both electric vehicle production and battery development have been discussed on an initial basis about a car that could potentially be released in 2027.Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives thinks Apple is looking at a handful of strategic EV partnerships and collaborations globally with existing automakers, including Hyundai.More from Ives: ""We believe based on our investor conversations over the last few weeks that many on the Street would rather see Apple partner on the EV path, than start building its own vehicles/factories given the margin and financial model implications down the road, coupled with the strategic product risk around such a gargantuan endeavor. This speaks to our view that the chances of a strategic partnerships with the likes of a Tesla, VW, Hyundai or other auto manufacturers in China (e.g., Nio, Xpeng) are in the 70%+ range over the next few years and could lay the groundwork for a dual path (start building its own line of EV autos post 2025) over the next decade if this EV/autonomous venture is successful with consumers.""The electric vehicle sector is red hot right now off the Apple buzz and Blue sweep in DC.",0.9898

485,"I find it amusing to hear people asking why Apple's stock went down after announcing a terrific quarter. It's an investor's choice to pick a stock they think can make them money in as short a time as possible. It's said that Gamestock and AMC are making billionaires out of the top investors and those companies are #$%$ investments. Stock manipulation can make and break billionaires. Making money from stocks doesn't require a good company investment, sometimes it just requires good luck and maybe great risk-taking. For me, Apple is a low-risk investment that pays off year after year while Gamestock and AMC may be bankrupt companies six months from now. OK, Apple is down after a blowout quarter and that doesn't make much sense to most people in the short-term. They just see they lost some money. I just see it as a blip in a year's stock movement and how Apple is strengthening itself for the future. By any standards, Apple is making an awful lot of money and that's good for me as a shareholder. I don't have to worry about Apple going out of business soon and I'm guaranteed my dividends. As I've owned Apple since 2004, plenty of market oddities have hit Apple but Apple has always recovered. Many other stocks didn't recover. I feel certain at some point this year, the blowout quarter will boost Apple's share value when it's least expected. Patience is needed when owning Apple. It's something shareholders need to get used to instead of getting frustrated or overly concerned. Three years ago everyone was saying Apple had nothing in the pipeline but they were all wrong. Apparently, Apple can still keep secrets. Apple is busily working on projects behind the scenes and the may be game-changers for all we know.Anyway, put the holiday quarter behind and move forward. Apple is still the market cap leader by a good amount with plenty of cash to work with. Don't be too disappointed in Apple because investors didn't respond to Apple's earnings report. That's their loss because they're busy trying to fulfill their greedy nature with get-rich-quick stocks. It's nothing I want to be involved in.

Amazon's cloud service growth is likely to suffer from more competition from Microsoft, Google, Oracle, etc. The cloud service space is finally getting rather crowded sooner than expected. Apple is supposed to remain strong thanks to an iPhone supercycle and a resurgence of Mac sales using Apple Silicon. Bundled Services revenue will continue to grow along with more active devices (a billion+) and a strong customer base. All of Apple's products are in high demand despite the pandemic. Many analysts thought Apple would be hit the hardest during the pandemic but they were wrong, very wrong. Anyway, Apple is supposed to stay strong at least for a couple of quarters in 2021 so that's good for shareholders.

It's not a big deal to me but I'm sure there are plenty of unhappy new Apple investors out there wondering why Apple stock is down on nearly perfect earnings. I'm guessing it's a market macro thing that just happens to include Apple and nothing directly due to Apple's fault. I've learned to live with this market weirdness and Apple has always risen above it. I have no idea when Apple will start to rise based on earnings, but I know it will eventually. Were Apple's numbers not good enough? I doubt that. Is there profit-taking going on? Maybe. I'm Apple-long so I'm not going to lose sleep over whatever is happening today or tomorrow. All the guessing of how much Apple was going up on earnings didn't quite work out for today. The future is too difficult to predict with any accuracy. I have to admit I didn't think Apple would drop on near perfect earnings, but that's just how things go. I'm not concerned about it and I'm going to happily look forward to tomorrow.",0.9914

1360,"With earnings about a week away, I just wanted to share some thoughts...Firstly, about analyst expectations. Folks, if Apple reports massive revenue it's great for us don't get me wrong, but some analysts calling for $100 billion or more in revenue, that's kind of unrealistic. It's almost like they're setting up Apple to fail. What if Apple only reports $85 to $90 billion does that warrant a drop in the share price? And let's not forget Apple did not provide guidance for this quarter. So expectations are too unrealistic. We're still in the middle of a pandemic. We're not out of the woods yet. If Apple can perform as good as they did last year I'd be satisfied, but if they do even better then that then I'd be very pleased. Secondly, I believe the selling is way overdone. We should see the stock price climb with positive results and upcoming announcements. The stock held onto the support level very well technically. So I believe the stock has a lot more room to run. There's so many revenue channels that can leaf to more growth. The continued buybacks will help with any dips in the long run.Third, I mentioned this in the past but I don't believe Apple will comment about Project Titan since the deal is still being ironed out with manufacturers. So don't expect them to shed any light on their plans till later on. I know many are eagerly waiting for this but still.Fourth, when earnings are announced, pay very close attention to some of the sleeper hit revenue channels that aren't being focused on as much like Apple Fitness. I believe these areas will be key to leading us to more growth and higher revenue in the future. Definitely not priced in at this current price.Own it don't trade it! Apple long!",0.9975

So weasels on WS punished the stock badly subsequently, and now they're buying them back and a few more before Q4 earnings.I believe this time is different, not only because we all know that Cook (not if but when) is going to come out sometime this year and announce the iCar (weasels don't want to miss out); but there are also rumors that they're looking to acquire some key Cos that would perfectly fit their products since they have tons of cash.Conclusion: depending on your financial situation, if you can then I would hold. If Gene Munster (he made many millionaires and billionaires in the Bay Area) believes that this will surpass 200, then, and based on what he has wizardly done previously, I'm banking on that it would blow the 200 to smithereens before the end of 2021.",0.9632

1546,"According to a new analytical report published this morning, Apple is likely to break previous iPhone sales records during its FY first quarter, setting up the company for what could be the biggest year ever for the iPhone. Although Oct-Nov 2020 global sell-through was down YoY, it declined by only low single digits. That is positive considering the four to six-week launch delay of the iPhone 12 versus the iPhone 11. There is now the possibility of a December sales surge, driven by the new iPhone 12, which would bring the quarter’s sell-through number into record territory. 2 x counterpoint research chart dec 23 2020 The popularity of the new model is evident when comparing iPhone 12 and iPhone 11 post-launch sales in the US market on a YoY, week-for-week basis. Jeff Fieldhack, Counterpoint Research’s Director of US Mobile Devices and Carrier Strategies, commented: ""The iPhone 12 consistently outperformed its predecessor during the first six weeks from launch – with the exception of week two, when strong early demand and ample supply delivered an exceptional sales week for the iPhone 11."" He also noted that ""Double and triple-digit weekly sales increases for the iPhone 12 over the iPhone 11 – despite 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max shortages – is sending a strong signal, and we believe the iPhone 12 will bolster global quarterly shipment growth for all iPhones to 21% YoY."" The US out-performance bodes well globally, and Counterpoint Research expects record iPhone shipments for the quarter to be driven not only by North America, but also China, Japan, India and Europe. Peter Richardson, Global Head of Research: ""What we’re seeing is a combination of things driving iPhone growth globally. These include pent up demand for a new 5G iPhone with both operators and consumers hungry for the new iPhone products, attractive prices on the iPhone 12 aided by bountiful promotional offers. iPhone SE sales also helped momentum together with iPhone 11 longevity, and solid Singles Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday performance."" While acknowledging that Apple faces issues, especially around supply, Richardson added that Apple ""is well positioned to mitigate the risks. The iPhone Pro and Pro Max are on backorder in the US, but lead times have dropped significantly over the past three weeks. Power management ICs remain constrained, but Apple is likely a favored customer going to the head of the line."" Lastly, Richard stated that ""The India Wistron controversy is not material and Apple is managing the situation. And in terms of their output capability globally, it is better than last year on increased hiring, overtime incentives and factories running more hours.""",0.9971

Based on recent Asia checks, he believes the supply chain is anticipating iPhone unit builds in the low to mid 90M range for the December quarter and for the March quarter he thinks builds for total iPhones ticked up another 5% over the last week and are now in the 60M-70M range, Ives tells investors.

1622,"Katy Huberty:”Investors are likely to underestimate the financial impact of a potential Apple Car, especially when considering the effect that Apple’s entrance into other markets has had on the addressable opportunity. Simplistically, Apple typically expands the size of any market it enters. At maturity, the iPod shipped more than 3x annual peak units of its predecessor, the Sony Walkman. Despite an ASP of more than three times the feature phone market, smartphones surpassed the peak feature phone market size less than 10 years after the iPhone launched. Apple Watch shipments today exceed the entire Swiss watch market. In other words, applying a market share figure to the current EV market forecast is likely to vastly underestimate the size of Apple’s car business in the future.”",0.9455

What I am here for is to explain what is going on with valuation. anyone saying tesla will go to 20k is just ignorant. I know tesla doesnt trade on fundamentals, but think about this for a moment. tesla has been the most shorted stock ever. when they hit the sp500, bigger funds begin to buy in, making those that recently have been short, unable to continue and have been forced to buy back the stock at a loss (increased price). this will not last much longer. eventually you will have some big time shorts (currently just micheal Burrell) come in and this will fall hard. it will get back up but do you want to risk that much depreciation? look at the numbers. you should invest where you can make 100 to 400% over a year. can you look at Teslas market cap and really believe all the big hedge funds that are now buying in are going to hold when it reaches 30 or more % than what it is now? and how hard do youthink this will fall? I've been investing in spacs for less than a year, what do I know right? I do have a portfolio that has gained 756%. and they arent sitting in overvalued positions. they are reinvested into companies with the potential for 3 to 400% returns for the year. currently my latest position was in hcac warrants (hcacw) I bought them at 1.8. also. bought more at 3.5. they are at 4.7. now they already merged with canoo, and will likely get to 10 to 15 in the near future. everyone should have seen by now hyundais surge, nearly 20 billion added to market cap just on the rumor that they are in talks with apple. heres the fun part. canoo is doing the engineering services for hyundai's ev sector. they have designed their new skateboard platform for them, they have their own as well and will be a disruptor in the market in so many ways but just think about this, #AAPL has talked about their monocell as superior battery tech. they are now talking with hyundai. musk has said that monocells are ""impossible"" and canoo tweeted the new year in with ready to keep engineering the 'impossible' in 2021 as if to give musk a heads up. then of course left with this:just read between the lines, but the rumor and sell on the news. I'm not here to pump, I'm here to help those that have a gut feeling right now listen to it. it's made me 756% for 2020 and I'm already up another 60% since then. canoo is #GOEV. warrants are #GOEVW. roll your profits over and gain another big run. them when tesla has had its correction we can be ready to jump back in again..",0.9958

Fortunately, Heplisav B only requires 2 shots over 30 days. US Military and DOD will be changing over to Heplisav B vaccine. I am pretty sure all military in the world will switching over.

1883,"Excerpts from the Motley Fool. 1. You still have to wait forever to get an iPhone 12 Pro Apple is reportedly ramping up production for the iPhone 12 in the first half of 2021. Combined with other factors suggesting very strong iPhone sales for the quarter, the higher ASP should lead to iPhone revenue significantly outperforming. And considering iPhone accounts for 50% of revenue, and typically closer to 60% in the first quarter, that should have a meaningful impact on its revenue versus expectations. 2. Suppliers are posting big revenue numbers Apple's biggest iPhone assembler, Foxconn, announced record revenue for the month of December. The Taiwanese company, which trades as Hon Hai Precision, reported sales of 713.8 billion New Taiwan dollars (about $25.5 billion) for December, and quarterly revenue of NT$2 trillion. That beat expectations of NT$1.8 trillion, according to Bloomberg. Foxconn's outperformance is also in line with the greater-than-expected demand for the iPhone 12 Pro. The company is the exclusive supplier of the high-end devices. Meanwhile, Dialog Semiconductor raised its fourth-quarter revenue outlook from a range of $380 million to $430 million to between $436 million and $441 million, Barron's reports. The chipmaker cited increased demand for 5G chips as the reason. Considering Apple accounts for the majority of its revenue, it's a pretty good bet those chips are going in iPhone 12s. And in late December, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said his Asia supply chain checks ""have now exceeded even our 'bull case scenario'"" in a note to investors. 3. New records in the App Store Apple reported record gross sales for its App Store in its annual new year update. In the week between Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, iOS users spent $1.8 billion in the App Store. That's up 27% from last year, and an acceleration from the 16% growth in sales in the same period in 2019. The company also recorded $540 million in sales on New Year's Day, up nearly 40% from last year. Those numbers indicate a lot of new iPhones under the tree this year. It also bodes well for Apple's all-important services segment -- its fastest-growing and highest-margin business. The App Store is Apple's most profitable service, generating gross profits well above its subscription services like Apple Music or Apple TV+. So outperformance on that front should lead to better-than-expected earnings. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty notes, ""If we keep the rest of our December quarter Apple Services forecast unchanged, the latest App Store data would imply December quarter Services revenue of $14.84 [billion] ... 40 [basis points] ahead of consensus at $14.78 [billion]."" It's very likely, however, that stronger App Store sales are a good indication of stronger sales of Apple's other services. It looks like the iPhone supercycle may be a reality this year based on the early results we've seen and other hints at strong demand. And that'll bolster Apple's entire business -- and the FAANG stock -- when it reports its full results on Jan. 27.",0.9975

1955,"A new report by Flurry Analytics states that nine of the top ten smartphones activated on Christmas Day 2020 in the United States were iPhones.Christmas Day in the United States is the single greatest day for new smartphone activations, so it represents a unique opportunity to analyse consumer preferences.The iPhone 11 was the most activated device on Christmas Day, with activations five percent higher than the trailing average of the period between December 18 and December 24. This is the second consecutive year that the iPhone 11 has taken the top spot, followed by the iPhone XR. The leading premium device was the iPhone 12 Pro Max, which has continued to see ""strong and long-lasting demand.""This ranking is in line with normal trends, as Apple's newer and higher-end devices generally only surge around launch due to early adopters. The iPhone 12 has made gains as users gradually replace their existing devices in the months after launch. Some smartphones, such as the iPhone XR, were not more popular than the trailing average for that device, meaning that it was not necessarily a popular gift for Christmas, but rather just a popular smartphone.The only non-Apple device to reach the top 10 was LG's budget K30 smartphone. Overall, budget devices dominated the top ten, with the iPhone SE and LG K30 seeing 34 percent and 181 percent surges respectively. Flurry believes that the success of past years' models, such as the iPhone 11 and iPhone XR, indicates that American consumers were more price-sensitive this holiday season.One notable exception from the top ten is the iPhone 12 mini, which has seemingly failed to catch consumers' attention as much as other devices, perhaps due to its discount of only $100 compared to the larger iPhone 12.This year, smartphone activations were down 23 percent year-on-year. Flurry speculates that this may be due to financial hardships, more limited family gatherings, or more spread out gift-giving this year.Flurry Analytics uses data from over one million mobile applications, providing insights from two billion mobile devices per month, and it will soon report on the full month of December to give a fuller picture of smartphone activations.",0.992

Price target of $200.Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty maintains an Outperform rating on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and raises the price target from $152 to $164 after yesterday's FQ1 report.Huberty notes that the active device installed base (10% from 7% in last year's period) and customer loyalty is still above 90%.The broad-based revenue recovery in Greater China points to sustained higher engagement and market share gains, says Huberty.Piper Sandler's Harsh Kumar (Overweight, $135 to $160) highlights the double-digit sales growth for all categories with the 17% Y/Y iPhone revenue boost indicating strong iPhone 12 demand. On the call, management mentioned that supplies remain tight for the iPhone Pro and Pro Max.Kumar notes that FQ1 gross margin came in well above expectations on the higher revenue and improved product mix, and Apple's margin forecast was largely flat for the current quarter.Evercore (Outperform, $160 to $163) says ""there is no need for Reddit mentions with a performance like this.""Analyst Amit Daryanani calls gross margins the ""sleeper upside.""The analyst thinks the lack of guidance for iPhone and Mac sales suggests material acceleration in those markets, offset by modest decelerations for Services and Wearables.Apple shares are down 2.4% pre-market to $138.64 in what is proving to be a notably volatile week for the Street.On the earnings call, Apple management said current quarter growth should accelerate on the year and follow typical seasonality on the quarter.

So when Apple users buy multiple products (iPhone + Airpods + watch + Mac) the churn essentially goes to zero. This is very relevant when we talk about entering new categories like Car.""Huberty also notes that Apple would only have to nab 2% auto mobility market share to match its iPhone revenue.She also thinks Apple is more likely to vertically integrate in auto due to its existing tech (operating system, processors, battery, cameras and displays), instead of striking partnerships.What about margins? Huberty says Apple would only make a move if it could generate double-digit margins at scale with long-term upside. As for timing, an Apple Car isn't anticipated for four or five years.On risk to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Huberty thinks the pair could grow the market together and doesn't expect a Blackberry-type flameout when Apple enters the market.Apple Car developments and potential auto-tech partnerships are expected to be a big theme in 2021.",0.9893

I don't know why Apple can't load up on video content for their AppleTV+ service. Apple has over a billion active devices on iPhones, iPads, desktops and laptops to serve content to. I keep hearing people say Apple's streaming content is rather thin. Apple can't just grow subscribers with original content because that's too expensive. Apple needs some classic content to fatten up its library. I still watch X-Files, Magnum P.I., The Rockford Files, etc. Good shows are always watchable even if they're decades old. How can Apple compete with Netflix for new subscribers if there isn't much content to watch. So Netflix shareholders will likely see 15% to 20% gains in share price on earnings. That's where the big money is going and it's perfectly understandable Apple may be ignored. Netflix is much easier to move than Apple is.I think Apple needs to double-down on streaming content to pull more subscribers. That seems like a no-brainer to me.

Apple still isn't made up of a higher percentage of institutional owners as before the split.

Are investors actually buying more shares at this price than if Apple's share price were 4X as much? I'm just trying to figure out if anything much changed since the four for one split. I honestly can't tell except for the fact I have more shares. Tesla's split worked very well as investors kept buying more stock, but it didn't work for Apple as investors, for the most part, stopped buying Apple after the split.

2941,"Dear my Apple compatriots. Do you feel like you have missed out on Biotech revolution?? NVAX AND MRNA are making tons of money and Covid Viruses won't be disappearing anytime soon per Public Health officials. There is one biotech Company that has been under the radar, but it is ready for blast off just like NVAX AND MRNA. That Company is Senseonic. As a diabetic instructor for over 10 years, I would say what Eversense CGM offers is as good or better than what Dexcom G6 or Abbott Libre brings. All CGM currently on the market are great but what sets Eversense XL from other CGM is the freedom from frequent site changes. After Eversense has been implanted it’s good for 90 days. In the 2nd qtr of 2021, FDA will approve 180 day model. Finally in 2023, Senseonics plan to get FDA approval for 365 day CGM. Every other CGM in the market requires switching out every 2 to 4 weeks. Also since Eversense is internal CGM, you can swim or exercise without much restrictions. Other CGM models are external and sensors need to be changed out more frequently. There is always possibility Abbot, Medtronic or Dexcom could buyout the company in the future. If Eversense 365 XL ever get approval from FDA in 2023, it would be very difficult for other CGM to compete with Senseonic. It would be like APPLE in 2007, unveiling revolutionary IPhone that completely changed the smartphone market. I believe Eversense 365 could do that to CGM market in 2023. When Apple announced IPhone to the world in 2007, Nokia, Motorola, Samsung and Black Berry laughed at Steve Jobs. We know what happened within 3 years of IPhone announcement",0.9975

3212,"To the people who argues that Nokia does not has enough short ratio to spark a rally like GME, I hope we can reason it out with some simple math:The market cap for GME is <1B. With a 80% short, the hedges get to make ~800M in the event that the stocks get utterly eviscerated. If share prices double, the hedges will lose 800M. This is what it means in dollar terms.Nokia might only have 10% shorts, but with a market cap of 23B, the hedges basically has a 2.4B bet - 3 times that of what they have on GME. TLDR: If the masses have our way, NOK will be more painful for the hedges than GME.Mpreover, there are mounting evidences that the funds are paying to attention to Nokia.(1) Recall the halt that happened 2 nights ago right after prices shot up to 9.79? Prices crashed immediately thereafter. It was obvious that certain circuit breaker measures were triggered by some large players. Measures to scare us off that is.(2) 1B volume traded in a single day and prices stay flat. It is obvious some big players were able to stagnate the prices with ladder trading. Likewise, scare tactics.(3) After hours crashes - only hedge funds can do after hours trade, so why the crash? It is obvious they don't want the price to rise and they are scaring us off with low volume dips.(4) Why was NOK singled out alone with other reddit stocks for a ban if the hedges were not concerned?Hold your lines guys. We are on the verge of victory.",0.7425

The problem is that every time Apple announces earnings the stock goes up and THEN it takes a dive. This particular earnings report is somewhat special because of the new line of IPhones......but that doesn't happen every year. I like to have money in my hands...not just watch it on paper.

Reports also indicate Apple raising iphone 12 production by 30% and App Store/services up another 30%. Also M1 and covid remote work/learning NOT in Q4 2019. This makes me ballpark a 30% increase in eps for Q4 2020 vs Q4 2019 resulting in Q4 eps increase of .40 resulting in Q4 eps of 1.68 resulting in trailing twelve months PE of 38 at a stock price of 145.

Analysts are looking for fiscal first quarter 2021 earnings to climb by 13.2% to $1.41 per share, while revenue jumped by 12.5% to $103.2 billion. The strong growth is expected to be driven by a huge jump in iPhone sales.

But what may be even more important is second quarter guidance. The company has been hesitant to provide forward guidance over the past few quarters. Guidance would certainly give investors the confidence that perhaps management is gaining some better visibility.

February was slow, and oh-so-serene Then March roared in and brought quarantine.Everyone felt miserable, with a shared sense of gloom (Unless you were a VC who had invested in Zoom.) To cheer us all up, Apple decided to show iPhone SE, Magic Keyboard and the new iPad Pro.But there was a slight hitch if you felt desirous; Apple Stores were shut down on account of the virus. April and May left us all feeling uneasy But June brought a virtual WWDC.Without a live crowd, it seemed strange I must say It looked like a keynote filmed by Michael Bay. It brought us great news, stopped us dead in our tracks Not a COVID vaccine, but Apple Silicon Macs.New services, too, were on Tim Cook’s big wish list An Apple One bundle and new Apple Fitness.

Partnered companies such as bestbuy and the cellular companies. I don’t think $175-$200 per share will happen, I expect similar progress as Netflix, a 16% increase which puts at $150-ish especially when taking in these factors. $100 billion report come Wednesday is no impossible but I think it’s a overreaction.
