84,the new competition for netflix won’t stand a chance these companies don’t have experience running streaming let alone movies and now they also have to be profitable in a few short years or run out of funds the only real contender is disney but in order to compete they have to shut down traditional revenue source so they can use their content inhouse the headwinds for disney is simple they plan to launch in 2020 but just like any new business they will fumble around for about 1 year before they find some normalcy on their operations and that’s going to be 2021 now at that point they will use up all their popular content by 2021 and will have to rely on new onesand thai is the tricky one as now they can’t profit much from it as they have to use in their streaming disney will run the streaming service at a loss for at least 5 yearsthat 2026 folkscan you handle that as an investor,0.8462

88,my two centsnet neutrality will matter eventually and matter in a big way because as someone said on bloomberg 12 of the bandwidth on the internet is netflix that may or may not be true if it is even half true its a big deal prices go up to nflx margins get squeezedand even before this change nflx was 3 times too high at least im seeing 130 for nowhowever manipulation might take it higher due to the tax thing though they dont make money so it shouldnt but it mightbe careful shorting use pieces and stops and eventually you will make a killing i thinktrade the chart though instead of gambling because of the potential for manipulation ive seen that a lot of times the effect isnt here yet they are still messing with it they can use it to kill shorts the hedge funds i meanbut eventually and obviously the cost comes to nflx that is already heavily debt burdened and the fox disney thing is a big negative as well as disney doing streaming along with google with youtube and others competition in that market doesnt sit stillnow go look at the pe i trades so thin that big money needs to get out while they can so it could crash there is a recession coming as well,-0.9886

2039,appointing rice and signing the obamas was for one reason  international subscriber growth in order to realize its heady targets nflx must penetrate and be the top one or two streaming services in a large percentage of countries imo hastings apparently feels trump damages american prestige and in turn nflx prospects so he is using the dynamic duo obamarice to assuage the world and ensure nflx can succeed in these countriesthe fact that nflx would be willing to take the risk of angering 12 of the usa in order to build intl bridges for nflx tells me that hastings and co are desperate for the subscriber growth that will only happen if the world embraces nflx this is not a good signso my thoughts have evolved on this sure hastings is a lib has a vehicle for spreading the message and can use the dynamic duo to do so but he did this for business not political reasons i believe his reasoning is not sound and demonstrates the challenges the company faces,0.6608

3637,how is a single tv channel with 15 of the revenue and 120 of the profit be worth 90 of disney is al this hype really about content that is absurd and while netflix is a fine company it is way overvalued if it is all about content then disney should be 5x the market cap of netflix disney has a tv channel plus they produce blockbuster films they own marvel star wars lucas films pixar abc and espn additional channels that produce their own content plus disney has real assets  namely two theme parks that throw off billions in profits annually and the real estate itself is valued at 34 billion but business is not all about content that is just moronic hype business is about making money period disney has multiple streams of income and much of it is all integrated make a princess movie that makes 100300 million in profit sell gobs of profitable toys and costumes of said princess along with other profitable royalties then charge families 400 so their daughter can dress up like the princess and eat chicken tenders with her in a castle in orlando netflix has none of those highly profitable additional income streams any media company could easily start competing with netflix just by streaming their content netflix doesnt own the pipe to its customers like comcast who sells content and highspeed internet over the same cable two income streams amazon does what netflix does but its service costs less and you get free 2day shipping on just about anything you order netflix is absolutely overvalued and i think will trade below 100 within 23 years it may have peaked recently and the options market definitely is bearish on this stock cbo market is not always right in the shortterm but often has a pretty good read on the overall prospects for a companies future stock price,0.9939

4418,hey all i’m not long or short here and just started looking into the company and am a little confused by the business model i get that they are spending boatloads to create content which is amounting to significant cash burn resulting in negative cfo seems as though management is confident this is necessary to keep subscribers growing and will lay the groundwork for a strong stream of income into the future that sounds great if it works out but this almost seems to good to be true questions that come to mind are how long will it take to be cash flow positive especially with the burn rate increasing rather than decreasing what if popular shows fall out of favor in the distant future get pirated or too many new shows flop what about competition this just seems to me like a very aggressive strategy and that no matter how many subscribers they can get the ultimate sustainability of the business will depend on being able to generate cash flow which can only mean higher prices which will attract more competition at some point this reminds me a little bit of the flaws of pandora’s model in a way where they had to spend more and more on royalties to keep up with subscriber growth i guess there’s something i’m missing here because market clearly doesn’t agree with me but it’s not like crazier things haven’t happened before or will again,0.988
