In a survey of over 1,500 U.S. consumers, 57% of respondents said they used Netflix (NFLX.NaE), up from 55% in May 2018 and 53% in September 2017. The survey also showed that 68% of Netflix (NFLX.NaE) subscribers were ""extremely"" or ""very satisfied"" with their experience. A hefty 84% percent of subscribers said they were ""not at all likely"" or ""slightly likely"" to cancel in the next three months, though that figure was below the 87% average of the last five quarters. In the U.K., 56% of respondents said they used Netflix (NFLX.NaE), up from 49% last year. Eight percent of subscribers in the U.K. said they were ""extremely"" or ""very"" satisfied with the service, and churn levels in the U.K. were at a record low; a record 71% said they were ""not at all"" or ""slightly likely"" to cancel in the next 3 months. ""We believe that Netflix (NFLX.NaE) has achieved a level of sustainable scale, growth, and profitability that isn't currently reflected in its stock price,"" wrote RBC analysts, led by Mark Mahaney, in a note to investors. He said he also sees potential in Netflix's (NFLX.NaE) push into India. ""India could well be a source of millions of new Netflix (NFLX.NaE) subscribers over the next few years,"" he wrote, ""but the company has a lot of work to do."" An RBC review of local Indian news sources suggested Netflix (NFLX.NaE) was off to a good start; its original series ""Sacred Games"" has become highly popular in the region. Mahaney also reiterated the company's outperform rating. Netflix (NFLX.NaE) shares have gained 80% so far this year, while the S&P 500 has gained 7.6%.",0.9831

207,"Why Netflix could surprise to the upsideThere are number of reasons why Netflix could deliver better-than-expected results next Tuesday. The COVID-19 pandemic was a key driver of the surge in the first half of the year when it added 25.9 million subscribers. In October, when the company offered that guidance, the pandemic was much more controlled than it is today. In the U.S., daily new cases went from about 60,000 to more than 200,000 today, while new infections similarly spiked in Europe, prompting lockdowns in countries like France and the U.K., as well as incremental measures in parts of the U.S., like Southern California and New York.That rise in cases is likely to have driven similar growth in subscriptions the way the initial outbreak in the spring did.The company also said it would�raise prices�in the U.S. at the end of October from $12.99/month to $13.99/month on its most popular membership option. While that move was widely expected, it shows management's confidence in both its long-term growth trajectory and the performance in the fourth quarter. A 2019 price increase caused Netflix to report a slight decline in subscribers in the second quarter, but that was during a seasonally slow quarter. Also, it was a larger price hike, as prices went up by $2 then compared to just a $1 hike last year. It also proved to be a temporary speed bump as it returned to steady growth in the following quarter.Additionally, there's evidence of a streaming boom across the industry in the fourth quarter.�Disney�reported that it added 13 million subscribers in the two months leading up to the beginning of December, while streaming aggregator�Reelgood�noted ""massive growth across the board,"" though it did say Netflix's leading market share declined from 25% to 22% among Reelgood's 2 million users.Finally, Netflix rolled out another strong slate of content in Q4.�The Queen's Gambit�was a surprise hit globally, sparking a surge in chess interest around the world, and the company also seems to have scored victories with the first season of�Emily in Paris, which was already renewed for its second season, and Season 4 of�The Crown, one of its strongest franchises. Towards the end of the quarter on Dec. 25, the company also released the first season of�Bridgerton, Shonda Rhimes' first production for the service, which has also received critical acclaim.Data from Reelgood shows that five of the top 10 streaming movies in the fourth quarter were released on Netflix, including�The Haunting,�Hubie Halloween,�Mank,�The Trial of The Chicago 7, and#$%$ Elegy.",0.9872

That option offers high-definition streaming on up to two different internet-connected devices simultaneously. Even at the higher price, that plan is still a few dollars cheaper than HBO, whose streaming service charges $15 per month.The extra cash will help to pay for Netflix's huge investment in original shows and films and finance the heavy debt it has assumed to ward off rivals such as Amazon, Disney and AT&T.While subscribers may bemoan a bigger monthly bill Wall Street cheered, sending shares up more than 6 percent in midday trading.This marks the fourth time that Netflix has raised its U.S. prices; the last hike came in late 2017 .

431,The gains nflx has had this year are great but when you look at where the market and what this has done the last 3 months it’s hard to be pleased. You want your stocks close to their 52 week highs when market is setting new records daily. It appears that large cap tech is suffering the most. It is strange because you see companies like roku crowdstrike google snowflake etc hitting new highs. Then you have companies like amzn nflx zoom which seem to be stuck despite great earnings. Zoom I understand more because of valuation. But then how can you explain snowflake. If snowflake is this high then zoom should be higher. If roku has run 30% in a few weeks then nflx should have seen some reaction along with that. So I just see a lot of disconnects which makes it harder to invest. Definitely been trading more this week. It’s basically a traders market right now and I guess just follow the momentum.,0.9372

Bad news for NFLX since that is an expected major growth area. I know this board doesn't like facts but this is real. From the article, ""The proposed rules, which have emerged in recent weeks in a series of private, draft government policies, have U.S. tech companies concerned, according to people familiar with the matter. American firms are betting billions on the Indian market because, unlike China’s, it has been relatively open to foreign competitors.

554,"Being a customer of NFLX, I think there is room to add other streaming service as long as the monthly total budget is less than $20. You paid a lot for cable shows in the old days. I cancelled my cable (50+ Mbps) and switch to AT&T fiber (300 Mbps), about half the price and 6x the speed. It's no brainer. So cable companies are in trouble since they used to be the only ones in my area gave you decent internet connection speed. I subscribed to cable for internet only and the cable shows I rarely watched and not subscribed with the bundle do not save much. With the saving, I'll add DIS+ to my streaming service. I believe the package is about $6.99 per month. I'll try out for one year and if I find value in them, I'll keep both. If I don't have time, I'll just keep one. So if most people think like me, then NFLX subscribers loss will be capped somewhat. Their dangers lie in adding new subscribers and future pricing increase. People new to streaming service will likely pick a cheaper package with good contents and DIS will win in this space. NFLX will have difficulty to further increase price to offset its production cost. They will be under more pressure to give up shows that don't immediately perform instead allow them time to play out more. Based on above thesis, I will not touch NFLX until one or two quarters into DIS+ have been turned on. In this market no need to take extra risks when you see it coming.",-0.2912

It's over $34,000 per coin. I am not saying that pi will be that successful, but what if it even reaches $100 per coin in the future? Even if you can mine 1000 coins by the mainnet launch the next year, those coins can be worth a significant amount of money.In any way, you NEVER have to pay anything to anyone to mine pi, it's open for anyone to mine on their phone as BitCoin was in earlier days. Just download the Pi network app on your phone, use invitation code ""celebration26"" when registering (it's by invitation only), and make sure to use your legal name as when they assign the coins to your wallet in the future, they will verify that if you are the person who you said you are.As far as my progress, I have mined so far about 10k coins which unofficially are worth about $10k and possibly can be worth much more when the mainnet is officially launched and the pi starts trading on crypto exchanges officially.",0.9604

It's hilarious that Netflix trades like a world-beating monopoly. When in fact they compete against the deadliest and richest competitors on the planet: Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon. Will Netflix survive? Sure, quite possibly. But should Netflix trade at the most expensive valuation of any company in the market? LOL. Just ask Excite, MySpace, Nokia, and Barnes and Noble! Competing against any ONE of Google, Facebook, Apple, or Amazon tends not to be fun or fruitful. Competing against all of them at once is REALLY not fun! I wonder if Netflix could possibly revisit its 2017 levels? In 2017 the stock traded in the 100s all year. Now, just 15 weeks later, it's trading in the 300s! Is this a permanent change?

Given high penetration in many developed market, Growth isn't great matrix but how many Subscriber left who might subscribe.Here is NFLX Subscriber peak analysis and it's scary.For No. purpose I am using 30% more household due to Common netflix account sharing. Which likely conservative.Current Subscriber count:- 125MWith Sharing About 165MTotal World house hold (Ex- China which clearly not going to launch anytime soon except licensing deal with limited extra income.):- 600M80% world population live on <$10/day, most of them can't even afford. Normally those household much bigger and so I assume 40% house hold can't afford Netflix like service more than month or two/year So Let's Reduce 35% house hold = 390 left.Now let's assume on average 50% of that 390 subscriber (Which actually mean 65%-70% penetration with sharing. This is very very high number because even USA they can't reach there and their marketing cost already balloon in USA just to keep current growth rate) = 185M.My prediction, Peak around 160-170M , after reach 150M, Growth will stall or even go negative. Growth likely slowdown in quarter or two as well.If price raised within 2 month, we might see 2-3 Quarter of growth Stall and peak reduce by 10% at least.If you are retail long, this is best time to take profit (Atleast some profit) peak is not far from here on growth. Normally stock react few month advance.

Keeps neutral rating.Goldman Sachs (Heath Terry)“Netflix has outperformed the best-fit-line in each of the last four quarters suggesting that the company is getting incremental leverage on its content investments.”Because subscriber additions continue to exceed expectations and the company is approaching “an inflection point in cash profitability, we believe shares of NFLX will continue to significantly outperform.”Raises price target to $450 from $420 “to reflect faster subscriber growth, particularly in international markets.” The firm maintained its buy rating and kept Netflix on its conviction list.RBC Capital Markets (Mark Mahaney)Global paid subscriber growth continues to accelerate, and the “pulling of pricing lever should be successful,” which “means accelerating revenue growth & operating margin expansion.”Raises price target to $480 from $450, not far below the Street-high target of $500.

So he is using the dynamic duo (Obama/Rice) to assuage the world and ensure NFLX can succeed in these countries.The fact that NFLX would be willing to take the risk of angering 1/2 of the USA in order to build int'l bridges for NFLX tells me that Hastings and co. are desperate for the subscriber growth that will only happen if the world embraces NFLX. This is not a good sign.So, my thoughts have evolved on this. Sure, Hastings is a Lib, has a vehicle for spreading the message, and can use the dynamic duo to do so.

2651,"Everyone knows about Netflix. Netflix is the biggest streaming site in the world. The confidence and the trust for Netflix is really high. The stock value is about 80 times more than the revenue, we feel confident in that, price target higher than todays value.I wanna give you a tips. a streaming site, Mavshack, that has been active as long as the Netflix was active until 2011 had a stock value not even three times more then the revenue until a few days ago. In 2011 Netflix was worth as most 48 dollars, only a year later in 2012 it went down to $7, even though Netflix had 26 million subscribers, it was increasing in subscribers. Netflix was worth in its bottom only $7.00. Today 2020 Netflix is worth around $500. That means that Netflix increased its stock value with more than 7000% since its bottom in 2012. Mavshack have had a similar road until now as Netflix had its first 10 year on the market until 2012. Mavshack is increasing alot in the amount of subscribers. But the stock value have not shown its true value. The stock value has been very volatile and also has been on a down side for a long time. many investors been sceptical an pessimism have been around the stock for a while.But now its going to be a change, December 3rd 2020 it was announced that Mavshack will start Europe's largest shopping studio in collaboration with the NEP the world's leading technical production company for live productions and events. together with an EP marshak Salma has created the market's most elegant and cost effective VR studio. the market cap of Mavshack is only around 12 million American dollars. the stock is around its bottom. I can't see it getting much lower than it is now.. Now many feel like it's abiously that the stock is going to increase. With more good news about the streaming, live-sport coming up after realease of corona-restrictions and also the live shopping studio this stock can increase very rapidly and high in stock value. My own price target for this stock is around 400% for the upcoming year. I have been following this company for a long time and now I see a bright future for the company, its been an annoying ride until now. Please do your own anilyses and look this up. I feel very sure about that this stock is going to increase a lot upcoming years even though nothing in this world is totally sure. Maybe you would like to invest little in mavshack to get a big opportunity to get a big return out of it . I would still say Netflix is a more safe option but Mavshack is a great spice to it.

Disney owns a massive amount of content, numerous studios to make content at, television networks and doesn’t borrow money to make content. Disney’s biggest deficit is ESPN.

2765,"How can Netflix stay up at least 180 points too high? Read the details, Hbo all series are quality, this is a game changer, they are trend setters!In year one, there will be 31 original series on HBO Max, growing to 50 series in 2021 (in addition to originals for legacy HBO), according to Kevin Reilly, chief content officer, HBO Max and president, TBS, TNT, and truTV. Underscoring HBO Max’s focus on “content that matters to viewers,” Reilly said the top 100 titles on streaming services drive half the total usage. Translation: HBO Max is focused on quality, not raw tonnage of content.As previously announced, HBO Max is getting its hands on the entire runs of “Friends,”“The Big Bang Theory,” “The West Wing” and “Pretty Little Liars,” among others; the entire Studio Ghibli film catalog; the full library of “Sesame Street” as well as the next five seasons; and CW dramas produced by Warner Bros. starting with the fall 2019 season (30 days prior to the TV premiere of the next seasons of the shows).HBO Max will have 1,800 movies at launch. In the first year, the film selection will include all the films in “The Matrix,” “The Hobbit” and “The Lord of the Rings” franchises as well as all titles in the last 10 years from DC Entertainment, including every Superman and Batman movie ever made. Recently released hit “Joker” starring Joaquin Phoenix will be available at launch.After the initial U.S. launch, AT&T will take HBO Max international — in 2021, it plans to debut localized versions of HBO Max in Latin America and Europe, according to Stankey.AT&T told investors Monday that it expects to spend $1.5 billion to $2 billion on HBO Max next year and invest a billion in each of the following two years, before hitting profitability in 2025.In 2021, WarnerMedia expects HBO Max to generate $1 billion in incremental revenue from the U.S. — over and above HBO — stepping up by a billion each year through 2025 to $5 billion. Those forecasts include ad revenue, expected to come in starting in 2021.It’s unclear how the so-called streaming wars will shake out, but Netflix investors in particular have been unnerved at the prospect of competition with content powerhouses like WarnerMedia, Disney and NBCUniversal. Some analysts believe it’s not a zero-sum game, with room for several big streamers to gain traction — likely at the expense of pay television.",0.9324

Yet nflx needs to go up about 20% to reach it’s all time highs. Ideally right now you’d be taking profits after the big market run. Not only has nflx declined almost $100 in a couple of months. It’s done it during a time of a very strong market. Most of us have cost basis much lower than $575 obviously but you’ve not only been in the red the last couple months here but you’ve incurred a steep opportunity cost. My reason I continue to hold is because the company is doing as well as ever and so many bullish signs with analysts price increases and subs. The disconnect between stock and company has fooled me.

I'd have turned the $1600 investment into $257K... Did something similar with Apple. Bought a $3K mac Pro in 2003... (intending to make money editing off of it). Instead had I invested that $3K in the stock in 2003.. at split-adjusted $1 a share... I'd be sitting on $840K.

2918,"How is a single ""TV channel"" with 1/5 of the revenue and 1/20 of the profit be worth 90% of Disney? Is al this hype really about content? That is absurd, and while Netflix is a fine company, it is way overvalued. If it is all about content then Disney should be 5X the market cap of Netflix. Disney has a TV channel, plus they produce blockbuster films, they own Marvel, Star Wars (Lucas Films), Pixar, ABC and ESPN (additional channels that produce their own content); plus Disney has real assets - namely two theme parks that throw off billions in profits annually and the real estate itself is valued at $3-4 billion. But business is not all about content. That is just moronic hype. Business is about making money, period. Disney has multiple streams of income and much of it is all integrated. Make a princess movie that makes $100-300 million in profit, sell gobs of profitable toys and costumes of said princess along with other profitable royalties, then charge families $400 so their daughter can dress up like the princess and eat chicken tenders with her in a castle in Orlando. Netflix has none of those highly profitable additional income streams. Any media company could easily start competing with Netflix just by streaming their content. Netflix doesn't own the pipe to its customers like Comcast who sells content and high-speed internet over the same cable, two income streams. Amazon does what Netflix does but its service costs less and you get free 2-day shipping on just about anything you order. Netflix is absolutely overvalued and I think will trade below $100 within 2-3 years. It may have peaked recently and the options market definitely is bearish on this stock.

2970,"Why No One Can Catch NetflixBY MarketWatch— 6:44 PM ET 08/26/2018Knocking Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) is easy. Critics say the streaming company can't grow without big spending, making it impossible to turn a profit. But that assessment misses the key insight driving Netflix's ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) success, and why the stock is likely to climb again after last month's tumble.What Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) understands is that getting subscribers and, just as important, keeping them, is everything in the new media environment. The definition of success has shifted from how many eyeballs a channel can grab on a given night to how effectively a piece of content helps retain subscribers month after month. That insight has propelled Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) far ahead of Hulu and prompted the costly takeover battle between Comcast(CMCSA) and Walt Disney(DIS) for 21st Century Fox(FOXA) assets.It is also why Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) is sweeping up Hollywood talent. Earlier this month Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) wooed Kenya Barris, the creator of ""Black-ish,"" away from Disney, signing him to an exclusive, multiyear deal. Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) has also nabbed producers Ryan Murphyfrom 21st Century Fox (https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-signs-producer-ryan-murphy-to-multimillion-dollar- deal-1518588414) and Shonda Rhimesfrom Disney (https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-signs-scandal-creator-shonda-rhimes- away-from-abc-as-battle-for-talent-escalates-1502683261). It is expected to book $8 billion in expenses this year, though it will likely spend closer to $12 billion, according to Michael Morris, a media analyst at Guggenheim Securities. To some, those numbers seem excessive, but by spending to have the best content, Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) is locking in its subscribers and locking out its competitors.Netflix's ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) great advantage over its rivals is it doesn't need to show profits, as long as the subscriber numbers keep climbing. Profits can come at Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) when it has locked in enough subscribers who keep paying for content at higher prices.The major risk for Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) is that it somehow miscalculates what its subscribers want and doesn't draw in as many as expected. That happened last quarter (https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-reports-weaker-than-expected-number-of-new- subscribers-1531771717), when the stock tumbled 14%. But Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) has had many tumbles over the years, and strong growth has resumed. Thanks to its algorithm, Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) knows better than anyone else what kind of content it needs and when to launch it to keep subscribers happy.Disney's streaming services, set to launch next year, are the only possible threat to Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...). But Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) has a giant lead; it will take Disney years to catch up, in part because lots of Disney content is still licensed to Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...).Admittedly, the bar for Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) shares is higher now, and investors are nervous about whether it can keep growing at the same levels. But Netflix ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) has plenty of eyeballs still to sweep up--not only in international markets such as India and South America, but also at home, where cord-cutting continues apace.Netflix's ( NFLX Loading...Loading...) big lead may be its most important strength. It can keep bringing in talent, which will bring in new subscribers and keep existing ones happy. It will take a powerful competitor to break that cycle.",0.9963

Overeas given 150 country launch, it's hard to determine but I think last Quater it's clear, cost is raising very quickly.Now why they keep spending more on advertisement in domestic.simple:- They have to replace all customer who they losing. Otherwise it will look they start losing subscriber instead gaining and stock will tank. If stock tank, it will much harder to finance spending & also retain talent. They likely offering stock as part of their content deal as well.In otherword, This is how you can hide serious problem with either Churn Rate or harder to get new customer.It's also possible that many are keep cancelling and resigning.

If so does that mean all developed market not much growth left and so Next 100M subscriber will mostly come from developing country. If so Netflix sure headed for temporary slowdown on subscriber growth for sure. There is no way developing countries can afford $10/year subscriptions and so no way those 100M can come in next 4-5 year. it will take way longer like 15 year.,0.3375

However a couple years later ( Tuesday before the bell) I decided to participate and open a good position on NFLX. I'm very happy I did and I don't think a quick $10 - $20 bump up is enough to get out and lock in gains this time. Same thing happened to me with TSLA- I saw a $100 gain / per share and got out.

These institutions are not prone to sell-off. For example with the GE stock; Vanguard maintains to own 600 million shares of GE, and BlackRock maintains to own 500 million shares of GE even GE fell from $26 to $13. Why they did not sell them. There was no SEC records that Vanguard or BlackRock bought or sold GE stocks. So will these institutions be triggered for a NFLX sell-off thus spiralling the NFLX price to half? It's a possibility but the chances of not happening is greater. In May 2002, NFLX = $1.21 and it has survived the Great Recession and reached this far to $418.

Along with the secular tailwinds blowing at its back, the 5-star analyst points out the simple reason why she thinks Netflix will keep on outperforming.“Analysis of our proprietary Netflix content power rankings highlights continued momentum in original content: As subscribers around the world spent more time at home during Q2 due to the pandemic, and amid continued competitive intensity, the importance of Netflix's content slate has arguably gone up. It seemingly delivered, creating a consistent stream of interest and buzz around original titles,” Maria wrote.You can count the roaring success of Tiger King, crime drama Ozark, dating reality series Too Hot to Handle, and Michael Jordan docuseries the Last Dance among the titles which have kept sofa bound consumers tuned into Netflix. Add to that children content which got a meaningful boost during schools’ closures and a sizeable library of reality TV shows and docuseries, “with the two genres representing over 20% of the top 10 most popular TV series during Q2,” and you get Ripps’ point. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-original-content-library-separates-005355727.html",0.9698

Another article seemed to point to Google's Youtube, Apple streaming, Amazon, and others having had time to become a force of resistance. Add in the high debt and it seems to me the odds are NFLX has seen its high for quite some time. jmhoI like to back out and look at longer time periods. Seems to have a message. The 4 year chart has $130 for support. If it goes to the 313-315 range again (I forgot the low), it will be the third time, I'm thinking it breaks through to the downside then. 385 to 316 or so was a nice shortdoesn't mean it is necessarily even going down from here or bouncing and then going down. I just think it is likely. ................To me, they are losing money. Someone pointed out that they went more in debtt for new content, then they made in revenue. That's scrary, but they do have the potential to bring in revenue for years on the content. It seems to me they jumped in very heavily into massive debt trying to fend off the competition, before the competition made them irrelevant.You know one serious issue is that Apple and Amazon and maybe others are willing to basically give away their streaming service just to get the subscribers to help them sell product in their stores. That's a touch one for NFLX to work against. They have been quite creative though. Maybe they will bring on the education thing or something else. They could start selling things, compete agains Amazon and Apple, fight fire with fire. It's possible they could come up with some ingenious ideas to keep growing.I think they won't or it will be too little to late.

After all, you do not often see companies with a $135B market cap issuing high-yield debt. While the equity market is painting a rosy outlook for the internet entertainment and digital content company, the outlook from the rating agencies and bond market is less optimistic. Netflix's new ten-year debt carried a 5.875% coupon, a 291bp spread over Treasuries at issuance. The interest cost on Netflix's debt is roughly 2% higher than where high-quality, low-levered, A-rated companies issue debt in today's market.When we look at the companies in the high-yield corporate bond market (HYG, JNK) with the largest equity market caps, Netflix certainly stands out.

I dreamt that I woke up the morning of November 8th (3 days later), looked at my phone as I routinely do, and saw a sudden drop down to $266.61 per share. It was between a $57 and $60 per share drop. I did my same drive routinely into the office having to pretend everything was okay, when it really wasn't. The dream felt so real, but I still thought it was a bunch of garbage until I saw this go near $328. I'm heeding God's warning to me now. I sold my position around 10:30 this morning. I know most of you on here won't believe me, but I had to get this off my chest. I don't want to see my brothers and sisters suffer tomorrow.",-0.6289

It's over $24,000 per coin. I am not saying that pi will be that successful, but what if it even reaches $100 per coin in the future? Even if you can mine 1000 coins by the mainnet launch the next year, those coins can be worth a significant amount of money.In any way, you NEVER have to pay anything to anyone to mine pi, it's open for anyone to mine on their phone as BitCoin was in earlier days. Just download the app on your phone, use invitation code ""celebration26"" when registering (it's by invitation only), and make sure to use your legal name as when they assign the coins to your wallet in the future, they will verify that if you are the person who you said you are.As far as my progress, I have mined so far about 10k coins which unofficially are worth about $8k and possibly can be worth much more when the mainnet is officially launched and the pi starts trading on crypto exchanges officially.",0.9561

Bonds funding this debt start maturing 2021, price of them is already dropping. Who would buy 10 year junk bonds from Netflix at 5.5% when 10 year treasury notes could be yielding 4% next year?They are going to have to up yield of the bonds they issue in hopes someone will buy them. But if they up the yield of the bonds it means they need to increase their profit margin which is already way below the rate they are paying on current bonds. They can't afford more expensive debt. Its irrelevant how many more subscribers they get or how great the shows are unless they start getting positive cash flow very soon.Fact is Netflix future is in their creditors hands, Netflix has no control. Why invest in a company that can't control its own destiny when there are positive cash flow growth companies like AMZN, GOOG or FB? Makes no sense to invest in Netflix when you have much better options out there. So many places to get just as much upside without the huge risk Netflix has.

Their library without out any new content is the largest and most well known not just in the US but the world. Disney+ will be cheaper than Netflix It will appeal to children and adults. Nflx sends more on content than any studio in the world... except Disney. This is Disney's game and they are entering the arena at time when NFLX is massive growth or bus. Ask yourself what library well be worth more in the end. One that owns The loin king, star wars every marvel ever made or a library that owns orange is the new black and bird box",0.8536

One of Josh's rules for an established swing level requires a 10 day hold above/below a support/Resistance, this means that going LONG here above 328 is very risky for SWINGS. Especially when market is at all-time highs and due for sharp NATURAL pullback. Investors dont worry, just hold...but swing traders, wait for 228 to break (or come close, below 330) before getting back in this beast. Now, if NFLX does NOT go back down, then we will just wait for higher resistance swing levels, and start our shorts again for quick 5-10 pullbacks. Again, we DO NOT guess direction, we instead wait patiently on sidelines till price comes to us. Way less stress and we ALWAYS get a damn good entry with this strategy. But there is far more to Day Trader Josh's strategy then what I just mapped out here. But at least you get the framework.

At its peak, Netscape Navigator's market share was over 90-percent. November 24, 1998 would prove to be the turning point in the company's history as AOL announced it would acquire Netscape for over $4 billion. Some saw it simply as a play by AOL to unshackle itself from Microsoft (AOL's browser was based on Internet Explorer). Updates began to slow and the browser began to shed users.

Many think growth only go hyper based on history but problem is it already 119M. Some analyst even point out that only 600M in world (X china) have broadband and So that is 20% of overall world market share. If you add account sharing (50% likely) that's 30% of entire world. I think growth will slow regardless of Disney and Apple streaming success. If they are very successful, We may have negative growth even.Growth get harder as it go higher. Sure Recent T-Mobile and cable provider free with order reduced sharing and bring some growth in USA and rest of world market , could be reason for 4Q beat and even 1Q.

So, NFLX will dump soon BEFORE GOING MUCH HIGHER then 400...watch an learn....we swing traders make way more in long-run. We lock in profits on each run. Mostly we go LONG till new highs break, take profits, then capitalize on pullbacks with shorts... then hop right back in LONG at lower levels.

Ive seen that a lot of times. The effect isn't here yet, they are still messing with it. They can use it to kill shorts, the hedge funds I mean.But eventually, and obviously, the cost comes to NFLX that is already heavily debt burdened.

5358,Yesterday CNBC focussed on Needham?s downgrade. There are all kinds of views but what I find disingenuous is that cnbc only published the negative one. There are four other updates from analyst. Bernstein at 422 yesterday. JP Morgan at 425 yesterday and stifel at 400 day before. piper jaffray today at 400. No mention of those at all. It also falls pre mkt because a network knows CNBc is going to focus on the negative one and starts shorting. Easy money. The flaw in Needham?s analysis is that she is treating the mkt as finite ie people will leave Netflix to go to Disney. But Disney and Apple did not get into this business to take customers from Netflix. They got in because they see a massive #$%$ in future years to streaming. So the point is all will win. The second flaw in Needham?s view is that she wants Netflix to introduce an ad model other wise they r in trouble. So now Laura from Needham wants to teach Reed Hastings the pioneer of streaming how to run his business when he does not see a problem.. just yesterday Sarantos at the UBS conference said business is intact. If he were losing subs he could easily do that. Short term because of these fears price can fall over next one year but don?t bank on it staying down. Too big a mkt and the suggestion they Netflix will lose 4 mn subs is complete nonsense with the pipeline of programmes.,-0.9024

It is up a factor of 44 since June 2010. It seems like the competition has gotten their act together and NFLX has grown their debt a huge amount, which puts their earnings in question; I mean do they really have an earnings? $130 might be in its future. growth 40%, PE 283Often you see a company with 40% growth and a PE of 80. 283/80 = 3.5353/ 3.5 = $100 per share",0.6705

5412,"Hey all, I’m not long or short here and just started looking into the company and am a little confused by the business model. I get that they are spending boatloads to create content which is amounting to significant cash burn resulting in negative CFO. Seems as though management is confident this is necessary to keep subscribers growing and will lay the groundwork for a strong stream of income into the future. That sounds great if it works out but this almost seems to good to be true. Questions that come to mind are: how long will it take to be cash flow positive, especially with the burn rate increasing rather than decreasing? What if popular shows fall out of favor in the distant future, get pirated, or too many new shows flop? What about competition? This just seems to me like a very aggressive strategy and that no matter how many subscribers they can get, the ultimate sustainability of the business will depend on being able to generate cash flow which can only mean higher prices which will attract more competition at some point. This reminds me a little bit of the flaws of Pandora’s model in a way where they had to spend more and more on royalties to keep up with subscriber growth. I guess there’s something I’m missing here because market clearly doesn’t agree with me but it’s not like crazier things haven’t happened before or will again...",0.9885

5433,"For the naysayers (and the longs who know a good company and investment when they see one):Netflix is a positive cash flow company, they are making money hand over fist. They currently owe more than they make, but as they gain subscribers (projected 200+ million by 2020) and pay the debt down NFLX will become one of the wealthiest companies on the planet. Companies borrow money all the time, even blue chip companies, to invest in growth and infrastructure. FB borrowed a ton of money before they were net positive, so did Sirius XM and AMZN. The math is there, and it's simple, that's why the stock price is what it is, with 79%+ institutional investment. The institutional investment wouldn't be so high if the banks didn't see a golden goose. Shorties just want to try and drive the price down with nonsense so they can make a 4-5% gain here or there, while us longs are already up over 100% on the year. I know what side I'd rather be on with this stock. The shorts are going to get burned and then cry that it's manipulation or some other nonsense. It's hilarious how no matter how well a stock is doing, there is always the ""sky is falling"" types that cry doom and gloom. If they'd care to take a look at numbers, NFLX only has a 4.5% short interest on its share float. That's literally like saying 4.5 out of 100 people think the stock is going to go down in the short term. That's extremely low. Most shorters don't have the stomach to watch a 5-10% rise above their short price, and they close with a loss; that is going to happen with the short float leading up to earnings, and we might get a nice little 2-3% squeeze on top of the next rally.

5484,"""These stocks have handily benefited from an economy flooded with subscription models, said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management. The growing popularity of subscription services, particularly across media, has been key to these names’ success.“They are essentially trading on the fact that they are growing their subscriptions. It really doesn’t matter how profitable they are; it almost doesn’t even matter how much revenue they have. It’s the subscription growth that really attracts them, because then it makes them a candidate for M&A for, probably, old media,” he said Thursday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.”“Until and unless their subscription growth rate slows down, I think it’s very dangerous to short them at this point. That’s the dynamic that’s really driving them, and that’s the dynamic that could push them even higher as we go from this point,” he added.https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/06/streaming-stocks-are-on-a-tear-and-its-not-just-netflix.html?__source=yahoo%7Cfinance%7Cheadline%7Cstory%7C&par=yahoo&yptr=yahoo",0.9621

5681,"For the group that is long Netflix are you just trying to run up the current hype or are like 5+ years long?How do you think they are going to deal with the financial debt hole they have and continue to dig themselves into?They are on a spree of issuing more and more junk bonds to produce original content which their operating margins % can barely cover the effective interest rate of these bonds. The operating margin does not include the expenses of the original content they are producing. How is it ever going to be possible to pay these bonds at maturity? Who is going to keep purchasing these bonds?Netflix issues 1 billion dollars in bonds that mature in 10 years at 5%. Makes a 5% operating margin off that (2012-2017 average). They use that operating margin to just pay off the interest on the bond. How can they ever pay the bond when it matures other then rolling it over into more debt?How do they ever escape this cycle? They need new debt to produce new content, subscribers and revenue would fall if they stop producing new content. They need a huge increase in operating income to even have a hope of paying down the current debt. Also with increasing interest rates they are going to have to start offering higher yielding bonds.IMO they operate like a ponzi scheme. Once the musical chairs with this debt scheme stops they are going to have to fire sale all their IP assets at pennies on the dollar to pay the bond holders. They will be lucky to get the balance sheet value of them.Curious how others think they will mature into a sustainable company in the future given the current state and business practices.",0.9729
